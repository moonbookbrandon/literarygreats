                            VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE;
                                    or,
                             THE FEAST OF BLOOD.

                             James Malcolm Rymer

                               P R E F A C E .

                                 ----------

     The unprecedented success of the romance of "Varney the Vampyre," leave
the Author but little to say further, than that he accepts that success and
its results as gratefully as it is possible for any one to do popular 
favours.

     A belief in the existence of Vampyres first took its rise in Norway and
Sweden, from whence it rapidly spread to more southern regions, taking a 
firm
hold of the imaginations of the more credulous portion of mankind.

     The following romance is collected from seemingly the most authentic
sources, and the Author must leave the question of credibility entirely to 
his
readers, not even thinking that he his peculiarly called upon to express his
own opinion upon the subject.

     Nothing has been omitted in the life of the unhappy Varney, which could
tend to throw a light upon his most extraordinary career, and the fact of 
his
death just as it is here related, made a great noise at the time through
Europe, and is to be found in the public prints for the year 1713.

     With these few observations, the Author and Publisher, are well content
to leave the work in the hands of the public, which has stamped it with an
approbation far exceeding their most sanguine expectations, and which is
calculated to act as the strongest possible ncentive to the production of
other works, which in a like, or perchance a still further degree may be
deserving of public patronage and support.

     To the whole of the Metropolitan Press for their laudatory notices, the
Author is peculiarly obliged.

     _London Sep._ 1847




                            VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE;
                                    OR,
                             THE FEAST OF BLOOD
                                 A Romance.

                                 CHAPTER I.

                    ----"How graves give up their dead,
                  And how the night air hideous grows
                  With shrieks!"

MIDNIGHT. -- THE HAIL-STORM. -- THE DREADFUL VISITOR. -- THE VAMPYRE.


     The solemn tones of an old cathedral clock have announced midnight -- 
the
air is thick and heavy -- a strange, death like stillness pervades all 
nature. 
Like the ominous calm which precedes some more than usually terrific 
outbreak
of the elements, they seem to have paused even in their ordinary 
fluctuations,
to gather a terrific strength for the great effort.  A faint peal of thunder
now comes from far off.  Like a signal gun for the battle of the winds to
begin, it appeared to awaken them from their lethargy, and one awful, 
warring
hurricane swept over a whole city, producing more devastation in the four or
five minutes it lasted, than would a half century of ordinary phenomena.

     It was as if some giant had blown upon some toy town, and scattered 
many
of the buildings before the hot blast of his terrific breath; for as 
suddenly
as that blast of wind had come did it cease, and all was as still and calm 
as
before.

     Sleepers awakened, and thought that what they had heard must be the
confused chimera of a dream.  They trembled and turned to sleep again.

     All is still -- still as the very grave.  Not a sound breaks the magic 
of
repose.  What is that -- a strange pattering noise, as of a million fairy
feet?  It is hail -- yes, a hail-storm has burst over the city.  Leaves are
dashed from the trees, mingled with small boughs; windows that lie most
opposed to the direct fury of the pelting particles of ice are broken, and 
the
rapt repose that before was so remarkable in its intensity, is exchanged for 
a
noise which, in its accumulation, drowns every cry of surprise or
consternation which here and there arose from persons who found their houses
invaded by the storm.

     Now and then, too, there would come a sudden gust of wind that in its
strength, as it blew laterally, would, for a moment, hold millions of the
hailstones suspended in mid air, but it was only to dash them with redoubled
force in some new direction, where more mischief was to be done.

     Oh, how the storm raged!  Hail -- rain -- wind.  It was, in very truth,
an awful night.

                   *            *           *           *

     There was an antique chamber in an ancient house.  Curious and quaint
carvings adorn the walls, and the large chimneypiece is a curiosity of 
itself. 
The ceiling is low, and a large bay window, from roof to floor, looks to the
west.  The window is latticed, and filled with curiously painted glass and
rich stained pieces, which send in a strange, yet beautiful light, when sun 
or
moon shines into the apartment.  There is but one portrait in that room,
although the walls seem paneled for the express purpose of containing a 
series
of pictures.  That portrait is of a young man, with a pale face, a stately
brow, and a strange expression about the eyes, which no one cared to look on
twice.

     There is a stately bed in that chamber, of carved walnut-wood is it 
made,
rich in design and elaborate in execution; one of those works which owe 
their
existence to the Elizabethan era.  It is hung with heavy silken and damask
furnishing; nodding feathers are at its corners -- covered with dust are 
they,
and they lend a funereal aspect to the room.  The floor is of polished oak.

     God! how the hail dashes on the old bay window!  Like an occasional
discharge of mimic musketry, it comes clashing, beating, and cracking upon 
the
small panes; but they resist it -- their small size saves them; the wind, 
the
hail, the rain, expend their fury in vain.

     The bed in that old chamber is occupied.  A creature formed in all
fashions of loveliness lies in a half sleep upon that ancient couch --- a 
girl
young and beautiful as a spring morning.  Her long hair has escaped from its
confinement and streams over the blackened coverings of the bedstead; she 
has
been restless in her sleep, for the clothing of the bed is in much 
confusion. 
One arm is over her head, the other hangs nearly off the side of the bed 
near
to which she lies.  A neck and bosom that would have formed a study for the
rarest sculptor that ever Providence gave genius to, were half disclosed.  
She
moaned slightly in her sleep, and once or twice the lips moved as if in 
prayer
-- at least one might judge so, for the name of Him who suffered for all 
came
once faintly from them.

     She had endured much fatigue, and the storm dose not awaken her; but it
can disturb the slumbers it does not possess the power to destroy entirely. 
The turmoil of the elements wakes the senses, although it cannot entirely
break the repose they have lapsed into.

     Oh, what a world of witchery was in that mouth, slightly parted, and
exhibiting within the pearly teeth that glistened even in the faint light 
that
came from that bay window.  How sweetly the long silken eyelashes lay upon 
the
cheek.  Now she moves, and one shoulder is entirely visible -- whiter, 
fairer
than the spotless clothing of the bed on which she lies, is the smooth skin 
of
that fair creature, just budding into womanhood, and in that transition 
state
which presents to us all the charms of the girl -- almost of the child, with
the more matured beauty and gentleness of advancing years.

     Was that lightning?  Yes -- an awful, vivid, terrifying flash -- then a
roaring peal of thunder, as if a thousand mountains were rolling one over 
the
other in the blue vault of Heaven!  Who sleeps now in that ancient city?  
Not
one living soul.  The dread trumpet of eternity could not more effectually
have awakened any one.

     The hail continues.  The wind continues.  The uproar of the elements
seems at its height.  Now she awakens -- that beautiful girl on the antique
bed; she opens those eyes of celestial blue, and a faint cry of alarm bursts
from her lips.  At least it is a cry which, amid the noise and turmoil
without, sounds but faint and weak.  She sits upon the bed and presses her
hands upon her eyes.  Heavens! what a wild torrent of wind, and rain, and
hail!  The thunder likewise seems intent upon awakening sufficient echoes to
last until the next flash of forked lightning should again produce the wild
concussion of the air.  She murmurs a prayer -- a prayer for those she loves
best; the names of those dear to her gentle heart come from her lips; she
weeps and prays; she thinks then of what devastation the storm must surely
produce, and to the great God of Heaven she prays for all living things. 
Another flash -- a wild, blue, bewildering flash of lightning streams across
that bay window, for an instant bringing out every colour in it with 
terrible
distinctness.  A shriek bursts from the lips of the young girl, and then, 
with
eyes fixed upon that window, which, in another moment, is all darkness, and
with such an expression of terror upon her face as it had never before 
known,
she trembled, and the perspiration of intense fear stood upon her brow.

     "What-- what was it?" she gasped; "real or delusion?  Oh, God, what was
it?  A figure tall and gaunt, endeavouring from the outside to unclasp the
window.  I saw it.  That flash of lightning revealed it to me.  It stood the
whole length of the window."

     There was a lull of the wind.  The hail was not falling so thickly --
moreover, it now fell, what there was of it, straight, and yet a strange
clattering sound came upon the glass of that long window.  It could not be a
delusion -- she is awake, and she hears it.  What can produce it?  Another
flash of lightning -- another shriek -- there could be now no delusion.

     A tall figure is standing on the ledge immediately outside the long
window.  It is its finger-nails upon the glass that produces the sound so 
like
the hail, now that the hail has ceased.  Intense fear paralysed the limbs of
the beautiful girl.  That one shriek is all she can utter -- with hand
clasped, a face of marble, a heart beating so wildly in her bosom, that each
moment it seems as if it would break its confines, eyes distended and fixed
upon the window, she waits, froze with horror.  The pattering and clattering
of the nails continue.  No word is spoken, and now she fancies she can trace
the darker form of that figure against the window, and she can see the long
arms moving to and fro, feeling for some mode of entrance.  What strange 
light
is that which now gradually creeps up into the air?  red and terrible --
brighter and brighter it grows.  The lightning has set fire to a mill, and 
the
reflection of the rapidly consuming building falls upon that long window. 
There can be no mistake.  The figure is there, still feeling for an 
entrance,
and clattering against the glass with its long nails, that appear as if the
growth of many years had been untouched.  She tries to scream again but a
choking sensation comes over her, and she cannot.  It is too dreadful -- she
tries to move -- each limb seems weighted down by tons of lead -- she can 
but
in a hoarse faint whisper cry, -- 

     "Help-- help-- help-- help!"

     And that one word she repeats like a person in a dream.  The red glare 
of
the fire continues.  It throws up the tall gaunt figure in hideous relief
against the long window.  It shows, too, upon the one portrait that is in 
the
chamber, and the portrait appears to fix its eyes upon the attempting
intruder, while the flickering light from the fire makes it look fearfully
lifelike.  A small pane of glass is broken, and the form from without
introduces a long gaunt hand, which seems utterly destitute of flesh.  The
fastening is removed, and one-half of the window, which opens like folding
doors, is swung wide open upon its hinges.

     And yet now she could not scream -- she could not move.  "Help! -- 
help!
-- help!" was all she could say.  But, oh, that look of terror that sat upon
her face, it was dreadful -- a look to haunt the memory for a life-time -- a
look to obtrude itself upon the happiest moments, and turn them to 
bitterness.

     The figure turns half round, and the light falls upon its face.  It is
perfectly white -- perfectly bloodless.  The eyes look like polished tin; 
the
lips are drawn back, and the principal feature next to those dreadful eyes 
is
the teeth -- the fearful looking teeth -- projecting like those of some wild 
animal, hideously, glaringly white, and fang-like.  It approaches the bed 
with
a strange, gliding movement.  It clashes together the long nails that
literally appear to hang from the finger ends.  No sound comes from its 
lips. 
Is she going mad -- that young and beautiful girl exposed to so much terror?
she has drawn up all her limbs; she cannot even now say help.  The power of
articulation is gone, but the power of movement has returned to her; she can
draw herself slowly along to the other side of the bed from that towards 
which
the hideous appearance is coming.

     But her eyes are fascinated.  The glance of a serpent could not have
produced a greater effect upon her than did the fixed gaze of those awful,
metallic-looking eyes that were bent down on her face.  Crouching down so 
that
the gigantic height was lost, and the horrible, protruding white face was 
the
most prominent object, came on the figure.  What was it? -- what did it want
there? -- what made it look so hideous -- so unlike an inhabitant of the
earth, and yet be on it?

     Now she has got to the verge of the bed, and the figure pauses.  It
seemed as if when it paused she lost the power to proceed.  The clothing of
the bed was now clutched in her hands with unconscious power.  She drew her
breath short and thick.  Her bosom heaves, and her limbs tremble, yet she
cannot withdraw her eyes from that marble-looking face.  He holds her with 
his
glittering eye.

     The storm has ceased -- all is still.  The winds are hushed; the church
clock proclaims the hour of one:  a hissing sound comes from the throat of 
the
hideous being, and he raises his long, gaunt arms -- the lips move.  He
advances.  The girl places one small foot on to the floor.  She is
unconsciously dragging the clothing with her.  The door of the room is in 
that
direction -- can she reach it?  Has she power to walk? -- can she withdraw 
her
eyes from the face of the intruder, and so break the hideous charm?  God of
Heaven! is it real, or some dream so like reality as to nearly overturn
judgment forever?

     The figure has paused again, and half on the bed and half out of it 
that
young girl lies trembling.  Her long hair streams across the entire width of
the bed.  As she has slowly moved along she has left it streaming across the
pillows.  The pause lasted about a minute -- oh, what an age of agony.  That
minute was, indeed, enough for madness to do its full work in.

     With a sudden rush that could not be foreseen -- with a strange howling
cry that was enough to awaken terror in every breast, the figure seized the
long tresses of her hair, and twining them round his bony hands he held her 
to
the bed.  Then she screamed -- Heaven granted her then power to scream. 
Shriek followed shriek in rapid succession.  The bed-clothes fell in a heap 
by
the side of the bed -- she was dragged by her long silken hair completely on
to it again.  Her beautifully rounded limbs quivered with the agony of her
soul.  The glassy, horrible eyes of the figure ran over that angelic form 
with
a hideous satisfaction -- horrible profanation.  He drags her head to the
bed's edge.  He forces it back by the long hair still entwined in his grasp. 
With a plunge he seizes her neck in his fang-like teeth -- a gush of blood,
and a hideous sucking noise follows.  _The girl has swooned, and the vampyre
is at his hideous repast!_

                                 Chapter II.

THE ALARM. -- THE PISTOL SHOT. -- THE PURSUIT AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.


     Lights flashed about the building, and various room doors opened; 
voices
called one to the other.  There was an universal stir and commotion among 
the
inhabitants.

     "Did you hear a scream, Harry?" asked a young man, half-dressed, as he
walked into the chamber of another about his own age.

     "I did-- where was it?"

     "God knows.  I dressed myself directly."

     "All is still now."

     "Yes; but unless I was dreaming there was a scream."

     "We could not both dream there was.  Where do you think it came from?"

     "It burst so suddenly upon my ears that I cannot say."

     There was a tap now at the door of the room where these young men were,
and a female voice said, -- 

     "For God's sake, get up!"

     "We are up," said both the young men, appearing.

     "Did you hear anything?"

     "Yes, a scream."

     "Oh, search the house -- search the house; where did it come from, can
you tell?"

     "Indeed we cannot, mother."

     Another person now joined the party.  He was a man of middle age, and, 
as
he came up to them, he said, -- 

     "Good God! what is the matter?"

     Scarcely had the words passed his lips, than such a rapid succession of
shrieks came upon their ears, that they felt absolutely stunned by them.  
The
elderly lady, whom one of the young men had called mother, fainted, and 
would
have fallen to the floor of the corridor in which they all stood, had she 
not
been promptly supported by the last comer, who himself staggered, as those
piercing cries came upon the night air.  He, however, was the first to
recover, for the young men seemed paralysed.

     "Henry," he cried, "for God's sake support your mother.  Can you doubt
that these cries come from Flora's room?"

     The young man mechanically supported his mother, and then the man who 
had
just spoken darted back to his own bed-room, from whence he returned in a
moment with a pair of pistols, and shouting, --  

     "Follow me who can!" he bounded across the corridor in the direction of
the antique apartment, from whence the cries proceeded, but which were now
hushed.

     That house was built for strength, and the doors were all of oak, and 
of
considerable thickness.  Unhappily, they had fastenings within, so that when
the man reached the chamber of her who so much required help, he was 
helpless,
for the door was fast.

     "Flora!  Flora!" he cried; "Flora, speak!"

     All was still.

     "Good God!" he added; "we must force the door."

     "I hear a strange noise within," said the young man, who trembled
violently.

     "And so do I.  What does it sound like?"

     "I scarcely know; but it closest resembles some animal eating, or 
sucking
some liquid."

     "What on earth can it be?  Have you no weapon that will force the door? 
I shall go mad if I am kept here."

     "I have," said the young man.  "Wait here a moment."

     He ran down the staircase, and presently returned with a small, but
powerful, iron crow-bar.

     "This will do," he said.

     "It will, it will.  -- Give it to me."

     "Has she not spoken?"

     "Not a word.  My mind misgives me that something very dreadful must 
have
happened to her."

     "And that odd noise!"

     "Still goes on.  Somehow, it curdles the very blood in my veins to hear
it."

     The man took the crow-bar, and with some difficulty succeeded in
introducing it between the door and the side of the wall -- still it 
required
great strength to move it, but it did move, with a harsh, crackling sound.

     "Push it!" cried he who was using the bar, "push the door at the same
time."

     The younger man did so.  For a few moments the massive door resisted. 
Then, suddenly, something gave way with a loud snap -- it was part of the
lock, -- and the door at once swung wide open.

     How true it is that we measure time by the events which happen within a
given space of it, rather than by its actual duration.

     To those who were engaged in forcing open the door of the antique
chamber, where slept the young girl whom they named Flora, each moment was
swelled into an hour of agony; but, in reality, from the first moment of the
alarm to that when the loud cracking noise heralded the destruction of the
fastenings of the door, there had elapsed but very few minutes indeed.

     "It opens-- it opens," cried the young man.

     "Another moment," said the stranger, as he still plied the crowbar --
"another moment, and we shall have free ingress to the chamber.  Be 
patient."

     This stranger's name was Marchdale; and even as he spoke, he succeeded 
in
throwing the massive door wide open, and clearing the passage to the 
chamber.

     To rush in with a light in his hand was the work of a moment to the 
young
man named Henry; but the very rapid progress he made into the apartment
prevented him from observing accurately what it contained, for the wind that
came in from the open window caught the flame of the candle, and although it
did not actually extinguish it, it blew it so much on one side, that it was
comparatively useless as a light.

     "Flora-- Flora!" he cried.

     Then with a sudden bound something dashed from off the bed. The
concussion against him was so sudden and so utterly unexpected, as well as 
so
tremendously violent, that he was thrown down, and, in his fall, the light 
was
fairly extinguished.

     All was darkness, save a dull, reddish kind of light that now and then,
from the nearly consumed mill in the immediate vicinity, came into the room. 
But by that light, dim, uncertain, and flickering as it was, some one was 
seen
to make for the window.

     Henry, although nearly stunned by his fall, saw a figure, gigantic in
height, which nearly reached from the floor to the ceiling.  The other young
man, George, saw it, and Mr. Marchdale likewise saw it, as did the lady who
had spoken to the two young men in the corridor when first the screams of 
the
young girl awakened alarm in the breasts of all the inhabitants of that 
house.

     The figure was about to pass out at the window which led to a kind of
balcony, from whence there was an easy descent to a garden.

     Before it passed out they each and all caught a glance of the side-
face,
and they saw that the lower part of it and the lips were dabbled in blood. 
They saw, too, one of those fearful-looking, shining, metallic eyes which
presented so terrible an appearance of unearthly ferocity.

     No wonder that for a moment a panic seized them all, which paralysed 
any
exertions they might otherwise have made to detain that hideous form.

     But Mr. Marchdale was a man of mature years; he had seen much in life,
both in this and in foreign lands; and he, although astonished to the extent
of being frightened, was much more likely to recover sooner than his younger
companions, which, indeed, he did, and acted promptly enough.

     "Don't rise, Henry," he cried.  "Lie still."

     Almost at the moment he uttered these words, he fired at the figure,
which then occupied the window, as if it were a gigantic figure set in a
frame.

     The report was tremendous in that chamber, for the pistol was no toy
weapon, but one made for actual service, and of sufficient length and bore 
of
barrel to carry destruction along with the bullets that came from it.

     "If that has missed its aim," said Mr. Marchdale, "I'll never pull
trigger again."

     As he spoke he dashed forward, and made a clutch at the figure he felt
convinced he had shot.

     The tall form turned upon him, and when he got a full view of the face,
which he did at that moment, from the opportune circumstance of the lady
returning at the instant with a light she had been to her own chamber to
procure, even he, Marchdale, with all his courage, and that was great, and 
all
his nervous energy, recoiled a step or two, and uttered the exclamation of,
"Great God!"

     That face was one never to be forgotten.  It was hideously flushed with
colour -- the colour of fresh blood; the eyes had a savage and remarkable
lustre whereas, before, they had looked like polished tin -- they now wore a
ten times brighter aspect, and flashes of light seemed to dart from them.  
The
mouth was open, as if, from the natural formation of the countenance, the 
lips
receded much from the large canine looking teeth.

     A strange howling noise came from the throat of this monstrous figure,
and it seemed upon the point of rushing upon Mr. Marchdale.  Suddenly, then,
as if some impulse had seized upon it, it uttered a wild and terrible
shrieking kind of laugh; and then turning, dashed through the window, and in
one instant disappeared from before the eyes of those who felt nearly
annihilated by its fearful presence.

     "God help us!" ejaculated Henry.

     Mr. Marchdale drew a long breath, and then, giving a stamp on the 
floor,
as if to recover himself from the state of agitation into which even he was
thrown, he cried, -- 

     "Be it what or who it may, I'll follow it."

     "No-- no-- do not," cried the lady.

     "I must, I will.  Let who will come with me-- I follow that dreadful
form."

     As he spoke, he took the road it took, and dashed through the window 
into
the balcony.

     "And we, too, George," exclaimed Henry; "we will follow Mr. Marchdale. 
This dreadful affair concerns us more nearly than it does him."

     The lady who was the mother of these young men, and of the beautiful 
girl
who had been so awfully visited, screamed aloud, and implored them to stay. 
But the voice of Mr. Marchdale was heard exclaiming aloud, -- 

     "I see it-- I see it; it makes for the wall."

     They hesitated no longer, but at once rushed into the balcony, and from
thence dropped into the garden.

     The mother approached the bed-side of the insensible, perhaps murdered
girl; she saw her, to all appearance, weltering in blood, and, overcome by 
her
emotions, she fainted on the floor of the room.

     When the two young men reached the garden, they found it much lighter
than might have been fairly expected; for not only was the morning rapidly
approaching, but the mill was still burning, and those mingled lights made
almost every object plainly visible, except when deep shadows were thrown 
from
some gigantic trees that had stood for centuries in that sweetly wooded 
spot. 
They heard the voice of Mr. Marchdale, as he cried, -- 

     "There-- there-- towards the wall.  There-- there-- God! how it bounds
along."

     The young men hastily dashed through a thicket in the direction from
whence his voice sounded, and then they found him looking wild and 
terrified,
and with something in his hand which looked like a portion of clothing.

     "Which way, which way?" they both cried in a breath.

     He leant heavily on the arm of George, as he pointed along a vista of
trees, and said in a low voice, -- 

     "God help us all.  It is not human.  Look there-- look there-- do you 
not
see it?"

     They looked in the direction he indicated.  At the end of this vista 
was
the wall of the garden.  At that point it was full twelve feet in height, 
and
as they looked, they saw the hideous, monstrous form they had traced from 
the
chamber of their sister, making frantic efforts to clear the obstacle.

     They saw it bound from the ground to the top of the wall, which it very
nearly reached, and then each time it fell back again into the garden with
such a dull, heavy sound, that the earth seemed to shake again with the
concussion.  They trembled -- well indeed they might, and for some minutes
they watched the figure making its fruitless efforts to leave the place.

     "What-- what is it?" whispered Henry, in hoarse accents.  "God, what 
can
it possibly be?"

     "I know not," replied Mr. Marchdale.  "I did seize it.  It was cold and
clammy like a corpse.  It cannot be human."

     "Not human?"

     "Look at it now.  It will surely escape now."

     "No, no-- we will not be terrified thus-- there is Heaven above us.  
Come
on, and, for dear Flora's sake, let us make an effort yet to seize this bold
intruder."

     "Take this pistol," said Marchdale.  "It is the fellow of the one I
fired.  Try its efficacy."

     "He will be gone," exclaimed Henry, as at this moment, after many
repeated attempts and fearful falls, the figure reached the top of the wall,
and then hung by its long arms a moment or two, previous to dragging itself
completely up.

     The idea of the appearance, be it what it might, entirely escaping,
seemed to nerve again Mr. Marchdale, and he, as well as the two young men, 
ran
forward towards the wall.  They got so close to the figure before it sprang
down on the outer side of the wall, that to miss killing it with the bullet
from the pistol was a matter of utter impossibility, unless wilfully.

     Henry had the weapon, and he pointed it full at the tall form with 
steady
aim.  He pulled the trigger -- the explosion followed, and that the bullet 
did
its office there could be no manner of doubt, for the figure gave a howling
shriek, and fell headlong from the wall on the outside.

     "I have shot him," cried Henry, "I have shot him."

 Next Time: The Disappearance of the Body. -- Flora's Recovery and Madness. 
--
 The Offer of Assistance From Sir Francis Varney.




                                CHAPTER III.

THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE BODY. -- FLORA'S RECOVERY AND MADNESS. -- THE OFFER
OF ASSISTANCE FROM SIR FRANCIS VARNEY.


     "He is human!" cried Henry; "I have surely killed him."

     "It would seem so," said M. Marchdale.  "Let us now hurry round to the
outside of the wall, and see where he lies."

     This was at once agreed to, and the whole three of them made what
expedition they could towards a gate which let into a paddock, across which
they hurried, and soon found themselves clear of the garden wall, so that 
they
could make way towards where they fully expected to find the body of him who
had worn so unearthly an aspect, but who it would be an excessive relief to
find was human.

     So hurried was the progress they made, that it was scarcely possible to
exchange many words as they went; a kind of breathless anxiety was upon 
them,
and in the speed they disregarded every obstacle, which would, at any other
time, have probably prevented them from taking the direct road they sought.

     It was difficult on the outside of the wall to say exactly which was 
the
precise spot which it might be supposed the body had fallen on; but, by
following the wall its entire length, surely they would come upon it.

     They did so; but, to their surprise, they got from its commencement to
its further extremity without finding any dead body, or even any symptoms of
one having lain there.

     At some parts close to the wall there grew a kind of heath, and,
consequently, the traces of blood would be lost among it, if it so happened
that at the precise spot at which the strange being had seemed to topple 
over,
such vegetation had existed.  This was to be ascertained; but now, after
traversing the whole length of the wall twice, they came to a halt, and 
looked
wonderingly in each other's faces.

     "There is nothing here," said Harry.

     "Nothing," added his brother.

     "It could not have been a delusion," at length said Mr. Marchdale, with 
a
shudder.

     "A delusion?" exclaimed the brothers.  "That is not possible; we all 
saw
it."

     "Then what terrible explanation can we give?"

     "By heavens!  I know not," exclaimed Henry.  "This adventure surpasses
all belief, and but for the great interest we have in it, I should regard it
with a world of curiosity."

     "It is too dreadful," said George; "for God's sake, Henry, let us 
return
to ascertain if poor Flora is killed."

     "My senses," said Henry, "were all so much absorbed in gazing at that
horrible form, that I never once looked towards her further than to see that
she was, to appearance, dead.  God help her! poor-- poor, beautiful Flora. 
This is, indeed, a sad, sad fate for you to come to.  Flora-- Flora-- "

     "Do not weep, Henry," said George.  "Rather let us now hasten home, 
where
we may find that tears are premature.  She may yet be living and restored to
us."

     "And," said Mr. Marchdale, "she may be able to give us some account of
this dreadful visitation."

     "True-- true," exclaimed Henry; "we will hasten home."

     They now turned their steps homewards, and as they went they much 
blamed
themselves for all leaving home together, and with terror pictured what 
might
occur in their absence to those who were now totally unprotected.

     "It was a rash impulse of us all to come in pursuit of this dreadful
figure," remarked Mr. Marchdale; "but do not torment yourself, Henry.  There
may be no reason for your fears."

     At the pace they went, they very soon reached the ancient house; and 
when
they came in sight of it, they saw lights flashing from the windows, and the
shadows of faces moving to and fro, indicating that the whole household was
up, and in a state of alarm.

     Henry, after some trouble, got the hall door opened by a terrified
servant, who was trembling so much that she could scarcely hold the light 
she
had with her.

     "Speak at once, Martha," said Henry.  "Is Flora living?"

     "Yes; but--"

     "Enough-- enough!  Thank God she lives; where is she now?"

     "In her own room, Master Henry.  Oh, dear-- oh, dear, what will become 
of
us all?"

     Henry rushed up the staircase, followed by George and Mr. Marchdale, 
nor
paused he once until he reached the room of his sister.

     "Mother," he said, before he crossed the threshold, "are you here?"

     "I am, my dear-- I am.  Come in, pray come in, and speak to Flora."

     "Come in, Mr. Marchdale," said Henry-- "come in; we will make no 
stranger
of you."

     They all entered the room.

     Several lights had been now brought into that antique chamber, and, in
addition to the mother of the beautiful girl who had been so fearfully
visited, there were two female domestics, who appeared to be in the greatest
possible fright, for they could render no assistance whatever to anybody.

     The tears were streaming down the mother's face, and the moment she saw
Mr. Marchdale, she clung to his arm, evidently unconscious of what she was
about, and exclaimed, -- 

     "Oh, what is this that has happened-- what is this?  Tell me, 
Marchdale! 
Robert Marchdale, you whom I have known even from my childhood, you will not
deceive me.  Tell me the meaning of all this?"

     "I cannot," he said, in a tone of much emotion.  "As God is my judge, I
am as much puzzled and amazed at the scene that has taken place here to-
night
as you can be."

     The mother wrung her hands and wept.

     "It was the storm that first awakened me," added Marchdale; "and then I
heard a scream."

     The brothers tremblingly approached the bed.  Flora was placed in a
sitting, half-reclining posture, propped up by pillows.  She was quite 
insensible, and her face was fearfully
pale; while that she breathed at all could be but very faintly seen.  On 
some
of her clothing, about the neck, were spots of blood, and she looked more 
like
one who had suffered some long and grievous illness, than a young girl in 
the
prime of life and in the most robust health, as she had been on the day
previous to the strange scene we have recorded.

     "Does she sleep?" said Henry, as a tear fell from his eyes upon her
pallid cheek.

     "No," replied Mr. Marchdale.  "This is a swoon, from which we must
recover her."

     Active measures were now adopted to restore the languid circulation, 
and,
after persevering in them for some time, they had the satisfaction of seeing
her open her eyes.

     Her first act upon consciousness returning, however, was to utter a 
loud
shriek, and it was not until Henry implored her to look around her, and see
that she was surrounded by none but friendly faces, that she would venture
again to open her eyes, and look timidly from one to the other.  Then she
shuddered, and burst into tears as she said, -- 

     "Oh, Heaven, have mercy upon me-- Heaven, have mercy upon me and save 
me
from that dreadful form."

     "There is no one here, Flora," said Mr. Marchdale, "but those who love
you, and who, in defence of you, if needs were would lay down their lives."

     "Oh, God!  Oh, God!"

     "You have been terrified.  But tell us distinctly what has happened?  
You
are quite safe now."

     She trembled so violently that Mr. Marchdale recommended that some
stimulant should be give to her, and she was persuaded, although not without
considerable difficulty, to swallow a small portion of some wine from a cup. 
There could be no doubt but that the stimulating effect of the wine was
beneficial, for a slight accession of colour visited her cheeks, and she 
spoke
in a firmer tone as she said, --

     "Do not leave me.  Oh, do not leave me, any of you.  I shall die if 
left
alone now.  Oh, save me-- save me.  That horrible form!  That fearful face!"

     "Tell us how it happened, dear Flora?" said Henry.

     "No-- no-- no," she said, "I do not think I shall ever sleep again."

     "Say not so; you will be more composed in a few hours, and then you can
tell us what has occurred."

     "I will tell you now.  I will tell you now."

     She placed her hands over her face for a moment, as if to collect her
scattered thoughts, and then she added, -- 

     "I was awakened by the storm, and I saw that terrible apparition at the
window.  I think I screamed, but I could not fly.  Oh, God!  I could not 
fly. 
It came-- it seized me by the hair.  I know no more.  I know no more."

     She passed her hand across her neck several times, and Mr. Marchdale
said, in an anxious voice, -- 

     "You seem, Flora, to have hurt your neck-- there is a wound."

     "A wound!" said the mother, and she brought a light close to the bed,
where all saw on the side of Flora's neck a small punctured wound; or, 
rather
two, for there was one a little distance from the other.

     It was from these wounds the blood had come which was observable upon 
her
night clothing.

     "How came these wounds?" said Henry.

     "I do not know," she replied.  "I feel very faint and weak, as if I had
almost bled to death."

     "You cannot have done so, dear Flora, for there are not above
half-a-dozen spots of blood to be seen at all."

     Mr. Marchdale leaned against the carved head of the bed for support, 
and
he uttered a deep groan.  All eyes were turned upon him, and Henry said, in 
a
voice of the most anxious inquiry, -- 

     "Have you something to say, Mr. Marchdale, which will throw some light
upon this affair."

     "No, no, no, nothing!" cried Mr. Marchdale, rousing himself at once 
from
the appearance of depression that had come over him.  "I have nothing to 
say,
but that I think Flora had better get some sleep if she can."

     "No sleep -- no sleep for me," again screamed Flora.  "Dare I be alone 
to
sleep?"

     "But you shall not be alone, dear Flora," said Henry.  "I will sit by
your bedside and watch you."

     She took his hand in both hers, and while the tears chased each other
down her cheeks, she said, -- 

     "Promise me, Henry, by all your hopes of Heaven, you will not leave 
me."

     "I promise."

     She gently laid herself down, with a deep sigh, and closed her eyes.

     "She is weak, and will sleep long," said Mr. Marchdale.

     "You sigh," said Henry.  "Some fearful thoughts, I feel certain, 
oppress
your heart."

     "Hush-- hush!" said Mr. Marchdale, as he pointed to Flora.  "Hush! not
here-- not here."

     "I understand," said Henry.

     "Let her sleep."

     There was a silence of some few minutes' duration.  Flora had dropped
into a deep slumber.  That silence was first broken by George, who said, -- 

     "Mr. Marchdale, look at that portrait."

     He pointed to the portrait in the frame to which we have alluded, and 
the
moment Marchdale looked at it he sunk into a chair as he exclaimed, -- 

     "Gracious Heaven, how like!"

     "It is-- it is," said Henry.  "Those eyes--"

     "And see the contour of the countenance, and the strange shape of the
mouth."

     "Exact-- exact."

     "That picture shall be moved from here.  The sight of it is at once
sufficient to awaken all her former terrors in poor Flora's brain if she
should chance to awaken and cast her eyes suddenly upon it."

     "And is it so like him who came here?" said the mother.

     "It is the very man himself," said Mr. Marchdale.  "I have not been in
this house long enough to ask any of you whose portrait that may be?"

     "It is," said Henry, "the portrait of Sir Runnagate Bannerworth, an
ancestor of ours, who first, by his vices, gave the great blow to the family
prosperity."

     "Indeed.  How long ago?"

     "About ninety years."

     "Ninety years.  'Tis a long while-- ninety years."

     "You muse upon it."

     "No, no.  I do wish, and yet I dread--"

     "What?"

     "To say something to you all.  But not here-- not here.  We will hold a
consultation on this matter to-morrow.  Not now-- not now."

     "The daylight is coming quickly on," said Henry; "I shall keep my 
sacred
promise of not moving from this room until Flora awakens; but there can be 
no
occasion for the detention of any of you.  One is sufficient here.  Go all 
of
you, and endeavour to procure what rest you can."

     "I will fetch you my powder-flask and bullets," said Mr. Marchdale; 
"and
you can, if you please, reload the pistols.  In about two hours more it will
be broad daylight."

     This arrangement was adopted.  Henry did reload the pistols, and placed
them on a table by the side of the bed, ready for immediate action, and 
then,
as Flora was sleeping soundly, all left the room but himself.

     Mrs. Bannerworth was the last to do so.  She would have remained, but 
for
the earnest solicitation of Henry, that she would endeavour to get some 
sleep
to make up for her broken night's repose, and she was indeed so broken down 
by
her alarm on Flora's account, that she had not power to resist, but with 
tears
flowing from her eyes, she sought her own chamber.

     And now the calmness of the night resumed its sway in that evil-fated
mansion; and although no one really slept but Flora, all were still.  Busy
thought kept every one else wakeful.  It was a mockery to lie down at all, 
and
Henry, full of strange and painful feelings as he was, preferred his present
position to the anxiety and apprehension on Flora's account which he knew he
should feel if she were not within the sphere of his own observation, and 
she
slept as soundly as some gentle infant tired of its playmates and its 
sports.

 Next Time: The Morning. -- The Consultation. -- The Fearful Suggestion.




                                 CHAPTER IV.

THE MORNING. -- THE CONSULTATION. -- THE FEARFUL SUGGESTION.


     What wonderfully different impressions and feelings, with regard to the
same circumstances, come across the mind in the broad, clear, and beautiful
light of day to what haunt the imagination, and often render the judgment
almost incapable of action, when the heavy shadow of night is upon all 
things.

     There must be a downright physical reason for this effect -- it is so
remarkable and so universal.  It seems that the sun's rays so completely 
alter
and modify the constitution of the atmosphere, that it produces, as we 
inhale
it, a wonderfully different effect upon the nerves of the human subject.

     We can account for this phenomenon in no other way.  Perhaps never in 
his
life had he, Henry Bannerworth, felt so strongly this transition of feeling 
as
he now felt it, when the beautiful daylight gradually dawned upon him, as he
kept his lonely watch by the bedside of his slumbering sister.

     The watch had been a perfectly undisturbed one.  Not the least sight or
sound or any intrusion had reached his senses.  All had been as still as the
very grave.

     And yet while the night lasted, and he was more indebted to the rays of
the candle, which he had placed upon a shelf, for the power to distinguish
objects than to light of the morning, a thousand uneasy and strange 
sensations
had found a home in his agitated bosom.

     He looked so many times at the portrait which was in the panel that at
 length he felt an undefined sensation of terror creep over him whenever he
took his eyes off it.

     He tried to keep himself from looking at it, but he found it vain, so 
he
adopted what, perhaps, was certainly the wisest, best plan, namely, to look 
at
it continually.

     He shifted his chair so that he could gaze upon it without any effort,
and he placed the candle so that a faint light was thrown upon it, and there
he sat, a prey to many conflicting and uncomfortable feelings, until the
daylight began to make the candle flame look dull and sickly.

     Solution for the events of the night he could find none.  He racked his
imagination in vain to find some means, however vague, of endeavouring to
account for what occurred, and still he was at fault.  All was to him 
wrapped
in the gloom of the most profound mystery.

     And how strangely, too, the eyes of that portrait appeared to look upon
him -- as if instinct with life, and as if the head to which they belonged 
was
busy in endeavouring to find out the secret communings of his soul.  It was
wonderfully well executed that portrait; so life-like, that the very 
features
seemed to move as you gazed upon them.

     "It shall be removed," said Henry.  "I would remove it now, but that it
seems absolutely painted on the panel, and I should awake Flora in any 
attempt
to do so."

     He arose and ascertained that such was the case, and that it would
require a workman, with proper tools adapted to the job, to remove the
portrait. 

     "True," he said, "I might now destroy it, but it is a pity to obscure a
work of such rare art as this is; I should blame myself if I were.  It shall
be removed to some other room of the house, however."

     Then, all of a sudden, it struck Henry how foolish it would be to 
remove
the portrait from the wall of a room which, in all likelihood, after that
night, would be uninhabited; for it was not probable that Flora would choose
again to inhabit a chamber in which she had gone through so much terror.

     "It can be left where it is," he said, "and we can fasten up, if we
please, even the very door of this room, so that no one need trouble
themselves any further about it."

     The morning was now coming fast, and just as Henry thought he would
partially draw a blind across the window, in order to shield from the direct
rays of the sun the eyes of Flora, she awoke.

     "Help -- help!"  she cried, and Henry was by her side in a moment.

     "You are safe, Flora -- you are safe," he said.

     "Where is it now?" she said.

     "What -- what, dear Flora?"

     "The dreadful apparition.  Oh, what have I done to be made thus
perpetually miserable?"

     "Think no more of it, Flora."

     "I must think.  My brain is on fire!  A million of strange eyes seem to
be gazing on me."

     "Great Heaven!  she raves," said Henry.

     "Hark -- hark -- hark!  He comes on the wings of the storm.  Oh, it is
most horrible -- horrible!"

     Henry rang the bell, but not sufficiently loudly to create any alarm. 
The sound reached the waking ear of the mother, who in a few moments was in
the room.

     "She has awakened," said Henry, "and has spoken, but she seems to me to
wander in her discourse.  For God's sake, soothe her, and try to bring her
mind round to its usual state."

     "I will, Henry -- I will."

     "And I think mother, if you were to get her out of this room, and into
some other chamber as far removed from this one as possible, it would tend 
to
withdraw her mind from what has occurred."

     "Yes; it shall be done.  Oh, Henry, what was it -- what do you think it
was?"

     "I am lost in a sea of wild conjecture.  I can form no conclusion; 
where
is Mr. Marchdale?"

     "I believe in his chamber."

     "Then I will go and consult with him."

     Henry proceeded at once to the chamber, which was, as he knew, occupied
by Mr. Marchdale; and as he crossed the corridor, he could not but pause a
moment to glance from a window at the face of nature.

     As is often the case, the terrific storm of the preceding evening had
cleared the air, and rendered it deliciously invigorating and lifelike.  The
weather had been dull, and there had been for some days a certain heaviness 
in
the atmosphere, which was now entirely removed.

     The morning sun was shining with uncommon brilliancy, birds were 
singing
in every tree and on every bush; so pleasant, so spirit-stirring,
health-giving a morning, seldom had he seen.  And the effect upon his 
spirits
was great, although not altogether what it might have been, had all gone on 
as
it usually was in the habit of doing at that house.  The ordinary little
casualties of evil fortune had certainly from time to time, in the shape of
illness, and one thing or another, attacked the family of the Bannerworths 
in
common with every other family, but here suddenly had arisen a something at
once terrible and inexplicable.

     He found Mr. Marchdale up and dressed, and apparently in deep and 
anxious
thought.  The moment he saw Henry, he said,  -- 

     "Flora is awake, I presume?"

     "Yes, but her mind appears to be much disturbed."

     "From bodily weakness, I dare say."

     "But why should she be bodily weak? she was strong and well, ay, as 
well
as she could ever be in all her life.  The glow of youth and health was on 
her
cheeks.  It is possible that, in the course of one night, she should become
bodily weak to such an extent?"

     "Henry," said Mr. Marchdale, sadly, "sit down.  I am not, as you know, 
a
superstitious man."

     "You certainly are not."

     "And yet, I never in all my life was so absolutely staggered as I have
been by the occurrences of to-night."

     "Say on."

     "There is a frightful, a hideous solution for them; one which every
consideration will tend to add strength to, one which I tremble to name now,
although, yesterday, at this hour, I should have laughed it to scorn."

     "Indeed!"

     "Yes, it is so.  Tell no one that which I am about to say to you.  Let
the dreadful suggestion remain with ourselves alone, Henry Bannerworth."

     "I -- I am lost in wonder."

     "You promise me?"

     "What-- what?"

     "That you will not repeat my opinion to any one."

     "I do."

     "On your honour."

     "On my honour, I promise."

     Mr. Marchdale rose, and proceeding to the door, he looked out to see 
that
there were no listeners near.  Having ascertained then that they were quite
alone, he returned, and drawing a chair close to that on which Henry sat, he
said, -- 

     "Henry, have you never heard of a strange and dreadful superstition
which, in some countries, is extremely rife, by which is it supposed that
there are beings who never die?"

     "Never die!"

     "Never.  In a word, Henry, have you never heard of-- of-- I dread to
pronounce the word."

     "Speak it.  God of Heaven! let me hear it."

     "_A vampyre!_"

     Henry sprung to his feet.  His whole frame quivered with emotion; the
drops of perspiration stood upon his brow, as, in a strange, hoarse voice, 
he
repeated the words, -- 

     "A vampyre!"

     "Even so; one who has to renew a dreadful existence by human blood-- 
one
who eats not and drinks not as other men-- a vampyre."

     Henry dropped into his seat, and uttered a deep groan of the most
exquisite anguish.

     "I could echo that groan," said Marchdale, "but that I am so thoroughly
bewildered I know not what to think."

     "Good God-- good God!"

     "Do not too readily yield to belief in so dreadful a supposition, I 
pray
you."

     "Yield belief!" exclaimed Henry, as he rose, and lifted up one of his
hands above his head.  "No; by Heaven, and the great God of all, who there
rules, I will not easily believe aught so awful and so monstrous."

     "I applaud your sentiment, Henry; not willingly would I deliver up 
myself
to so frightful a belief-- it is too horrible. I merely have told you of 
that
which you saw was on my mind.  You have surely before heard of such things."

     "I have-- I have."

     "I much marvel, then, that the supposition did not occur to you, 
Henry."

     "It did not-- it did not, Marchdale.  It-- it was too dreadful, I
suppose, to find a home in my heart.  Oh!  Flora, Flora, if this horrible 
idea
should once occur to you, reason cannot, I am quite sure, uphold you against
it."

     "Let no one presume to insinuate it to her, Henry.  I would not have it
mentioned to her for worlds."

     "Nor I-- nor I.  Good God!  I shudder at the very thought-- the mere
possibility; but there is no possibility, there can be none.  I will not
believe it."

     "Nor I."

     "No; by Heaven's justice, goodness, grace and mercy, I will not believe
it."

     "'Tis well sworn, Henry; and now, discarding the supposition that Flora
has been visited by a vampyre, let us seriously set about endeavouring, if 
we
can, to account for what has happened in this house."

     "I-- I cannot now."

     "Nay, let us examine the matter; if we can find any natural 
explanation,
let us cling to it, Henry, as the sheet-anchor of our very souls."

     "Do you think.  You are fertile in expedients.  Do you think, 
Marchdale;
and, for Heaven's sake, and for the sake of our worn peace, find out some
other way of accounting for what has happened, than the hideous one you have
suggested."

     "And yet my pistol bullets hurt him not; and he has left the tokens of
his presence on the neck of Flora."

     "Peace, oh! peace.  Do not, I pray you, accumulate reasons why I should
receive such a dismal, awful superstition.  Oh, do not, Marchdale, as you 
love
me!"

     "You know my attachment to you," said Marchdale, "is sincere; and yet,
Heaven help us!"

     His voice was broken by grief as he spoke, and he turned aside his head
to hide the bursting tears that would, despite all his efforts, show
themselves in his eyes.

     "Marchdale," added Henry, after a pause of some moments' duration, "I
will sit up to-night with my sister."

     "Do-- do!"

     "Think you there is a chance it may come again?"

     "I cannot-- I dare not speculate upon the coming of so dreadful a
visitor, Henry; but I will hold watch with you most willingly."

     "You will, Marchdale?"

     "My hand upon it.  Come what dangers may, I will share them with you,
Henry."

     "A thousand thanks.  Say nothing, then, to George of what we have been
talking about.  He is of a highly susceptible nature and the very idea of 
such
a thing would kill him."

     "I will; be mute.  Remove your sister to some other chamber, let me beg
of you, Henry; the one she now inhabits will always be suggestive of 
horrible
thoughts."

     "I will; and that dreadful-looking portrait, with its perfect likeness 
to
him who came last night."

     "Perfect indeed.  Do you intend to remove it?"

     "I do not.  I thought of doing so; but it is actually on the panel in 
the
wall, and I would not willingly destroy it, and it may as well remain where 
it
is in that chamber, which I can readily now believe will become henceforward 
a
deserted one in this house."

     "It may well become such."

     "Who comes here?  I hear a step."

     There was a tap at the door at this moment, and George made his
appearance in answer to the summons to come in.  He looked pale and ill; his
face betrayed how much he had mentally suffered during the night, and almost
directly he got into the bed-chamber he said, -- 

     "I shall, I am sure, be censured by you both for what I am going to 
say;
but I cannot help saying it, nevertheless, for to keep it to myself would
destroy me."

     "Good God, George!  what is it?" said Mr. Marchdale.

     "Speak it out!" said Henry.

     "I have been thinking of what has occurred here, and the result of that
thought has been one of the wildest suppositions that ever I thought I 
should
have to entertain.  Have you never heard of a vampyre?"

     Henry sighed deeply, and Marchdale was silent.

     "I say a vampyre," added George, with much excitement in his manner.  
"It
is a fearful, a horrible supposition; but our poor, dear Flora has been
visited by a vampyre, and I shall go completely mad!"

     He sat down, and covering his face with his hands, he wept bitterly and
abundantly.

     "George," said Henry, when he saw that the frantic grief had in 
somemeasure abated -- "be calm, George, and endeavour to
listen to me."

     "I hear, Henry."

     "Well, then, do not suppose that you are the only one in this house to
whom so dreadful a superstition has occurred."

     "Not the only one?"

     "No; it has occurred to Mr. Marchdale also."

     "Gracious Heaven!"

     "He mentioned it to me; but we have both agreed to repudiate it with
horror."

     "To-- repudiate-- it?"

     "Yes, George."

     "And yet-- and yet--"

     "Hush, hush!  I know what you would say.  You would tell us that our
repudiation of it cannot affect the fact.  Of that we are aware; but yet 
will
we disbelieve that which a belief in would be enough to drive us mad."

     "What do you intend to do?"

     "To keep this supposition to ourselves, in the first place; to guard it
most zealously from the ears of Flora."

     "Do you think she has never heard of vampyres?"

     "I never heard her mention that in all her reading she had gathered 
even
a hint of such a fearful superstition.  If she has, we must be guided by
circumstances, and do the best we can."

     "Pray Heaven she may not!"

     "Amen to that prayer, George," said Henry.  "Mr. Marchdale and I intend
to keep watch over Flora to-night."

     "May not I join you?"

     "Your health, dear George, will not permit you to engage in such 
matters. 
Do you seek your natural repose, and leave it to us to do the best we can in
this most fearful and terrible emergency."

     "As you please, brother, and as you please, Mr. Marchdale.  I know I am 
a
frail reed, and my belief is that this affair will kill me quite.  The truth
is, I am horrified-- utterly and frightfully horrified.  Like my poor, dear
sister, I do not believe I shall ever sleep again."

     "Do not fancy that, George," said Marchdale.  "You very much add to the
uneasiness which must be you poor mother's portion, by allowing this
circumstance to so much affect you.  You will know her affection for you 
all,
and let me therefore, as a very old friend of hers, entreat you to wear as
cheerful an aspect as you can in her presence."

     "For once in my life," said George, sadly, "I will, to my dear mother,
endeavour to play the hypocrite."

     "Do so," said Henry.  "The motive will sanction any such deceit as 
that,
George, be assured."

     The day wore on, and Poor Flora remained in a very precarious 
situation. 
It was not until mid-day that Henry made up his mind he would call in a
medical gentleman to her, and then rode to the neighbouring market-town, 
where
he knew an extremely intelligent practitioner resided.  This gentleman Henry
resolved upon, under a promise of secrecy, making a confidant of; but, long
before he reached him, he found he might well dispense with the promise of
secrecy.

     He had never thought, so engaged had he been with other matters, that 
the
servants were cognizant of the whole affair, and that from them he had no
expectation of being able to keep the whole story in all its details.  Of
course such an opportunity for tale-bearing and gossiping was not likely to 
be
lost; and while Henry was thinking over how he had better act in the matter,
the news that Flora Bannerworth had been visited in the night by a vampyre -
-
for the servants named the visitation such at once -- was spreading all over
the county.

     As he rode along, Henry met a gentleman on horseback who belonged to 
the
county, and who, reining in his steed, said to him,

     "Good morning, Mr. Bannerworth."

     "Good morning," responded Henry, and he would have ridden on, but the
gentleman added, -- 

     "Excuse me for interrupting you, sir; but what is the strange story 
that
is in everybody's mouth about a vampyre?"

     Henry nearly fell off his horse, he was so much astonished, and, 
wheeling
the animal around, he said, -- 

     "In everybody's mouth!"

     "Yes; I have heard it from at least a dozen persons."

     "You surprise me."

     "Is it untrue?  Of course I am not so absurd as really to believe about
the vampyre; but is there no foundation at all to it?  We generally find 
that
at the bottom of these common reports there is a something around which, as 
a
nucleus, the whole has formed."

     "My sister is unwell."

     "Ah, and that's all.  It really is too bad, now."

     "We had a visitor last night."

     "A thief, I suppose?"

     "Yes, yes-- I believe a thief.  I do believe it was a thief, and she 
was
terrified."

     "Of course, and upon such a thing is grafted a story of a vampyre, and
the marks of his teeth being upon her neck, and all the circumstantial
particulars."

     "Yes, yes."

     "Good morning, Mr. Bannerworth."

     Henry bade the gentleman good morning, and much vexed at the publicity
which the affair had already obtained, he set spurs to his horse, determined
that he would speak to no one else upon so uncomfortable a theme.  Several
attempts were made to stop him, but he only waved his hand and trotted on, 
nor
did he pause in his speed till he reached the door of Mr. Chillingworth, the
medical man whom he intended to consult.

     Henry knew that at such a time he would be at home, which was the case,
and he was soon closeted with the man of drugs.  Henry begged his patient
hearing, which being accorded, he related to him at full length what had
happened, not omitting, to the best of his remembrance, any one particular. 
When he had concluded his narration the doctor shifted his position several
times, and then said, -- 

     "That's all?"

     "Yes-- and enough too."

     "More than enough, I should say, my young friend.  You astonish me."

     "Can you form any supposition, sir, on the subject?"

     "Not just now.  What is your own idea?"

     "I cannot be said to have one about it.  It is too absurd to tell you
that my brother George is impressed with a belief a vampyre has visited the
house."

     "I never in all my life heard a more circumstantial narrative in favour
of so hideous a superstition."

     "Well, but you cannot believe--"

     "Believe what?"

     "That the dead can come to life again, and by such a process keep up
vitality."

     "Do you take me for a fool?"

     "Certainly not."

     "Then why do you ask me such questions?"

     "But the glaring facts of the case?"

     "I don't care if they were ten times more glaring, I won't believe it.  
I
would rather believe you were all mad, the whole family of you-- that at the
full of the moon you all were a little cracked."

     "And so would I."

     "You go home now, and I will call and see your sister in the course of
two hours.  Something may turn up yet, to throw some new light on this 
strange
subject."

     With this understanding Henry went home, and he took care to ride as 
fast
as before, in order to avoid questions, so that he got back to his old
ancestral home without going through the disagreeable ordeal of having to
explain to any one what had disturbed the peace of it.

     When Henry reached his home, he found that the evening was rapidly 
coming
on, and before he could permit himself to think upon any other subject, he
inquired how his terrified sister had passed the hours during his absence.

     He found that but little improvement had taken place in her, and that 
she
had occasionally slept, but to awaken and speak incoherently, as if the 
shock
she had received had had some serious effect upon her nerves.  He repaired 
at
once to her room, and finding that she was awake, he leaned over her, and
spoke tenderly to her.

     "Flora," he said, "dear Flora, you are better now?"

     "Harry, is that you?"

     "Yes, dear."

     "Oh, tell me what has happened?"

     "Have you not a recollection, Flora?"

     "Yes, yes, Henry; but what was it?  They none of them will tell me what
it was, Henry."

     "Be calm, dear.  No doubt some attempt to rob the house."

     "Think you so?"

     "Yes; the bay window was particularly adapted for such a purpose; but 
now
that you are removed here to this room, you will be able to rest in peace."

     "I shall die of terror, Henry.  Even now those eyes are glaring on me 
so
hideously.  Oh, it is fearful-- it is very fearful, Henry.  Do you not pity
me, and no one will promise to remain with me at night."

     "Indeed, Flora, you are mistaken, for I intend to sit by your bedside
armed, and so preserve you from all harm."

     She clutched his hand eagerly, as she said, --

     "You will, Henry.  You will, and not think it too much trouble, dear
Henry."

     "It can be no trouble, Flora."

     "Then I shall rest in peace, for I know that the dreadful vampyre 
cannot
come to me when you are by."

     "The what, Flora?"

     "The vampyre, Henry.  It was a vampyre."

     "Good God, who told you so?"

     "No one.  I have read of them in the book of travels in Norway, which 
Mr.
Marchdale lent us all."

     "Alas, alas!" groaned Henry.  "Discard, I pray you, such a thought from
your mind."

     "Can we discard thoughts.  What power have we but from the mind, which 
is
ourselves?"

     "True, true."

     "Hark, what noise is that?  I thought I heard a noise.  Henry, when you
go, ring for some one first.  Was there not a noise?"

     "The accidental shutting of some door, dear."

     "Was it that?"

     "It was."

     "Then I am relieved.  Henry, I sometimes fancy I am in the tomb, and 
that
some one is feasting on my flesh.   They do say, too, that those who in life
have been bled by a vampyre, become themselves vampyres, and have the same
horrible taste for blood as those before them.  Is it not horrible?"

     "You only vex yourself with such thoughts, Flora.  Mr. Chillingworth is
coming to see you."

     "Can he minister to a mind diseased?"

     "But yours is not, Flora.  Your mind is healthful, and so, although his
power extends not so far, we will thank Heaven, dear Flora, that you need it
not."

     She sighed deeply, and she said, -- 

     "Heaven help me!  I know not, Henry.  The dreadful being held on to my
hair.  I must have it all taken off.  I tried to get away, but it dragged me
back-- a brutal thing it was.  Oh, then at that moment, Henry I felt as if
something strange took place in my brain, and that I was going mad!  I saw
those glazed eyes close to mine-- I felt a hot, pestiferous breath upon my
face-- help-- help!"

     "Hush! my Flora, hush!  Look at me."

     "I am calm again.  It fixed its teeth in my throat.  Did I faint away?"

     "You did, dear; but let me pray you to refer all this to imagination; 
or
at least the greater part of it."

     "But you saw it."

     "Yes--"

     "All saw it."

     "We all saw some man-- a housebreaker-- it must have been some
housebreaker.  What more easy, you know, dear Flora, than to assume some 
such
disguise?"

     "Was anything stolen?"

     "Not that I know of; but there was an alarm, you know."

     Flora shook her head, as she said, in a low voice, -- 

     "That which came here was more than mortal.  Oh, Henry, if it had but
killed me, now I had been happy; but I cannot live-- I hear it breathing 
now."

     "Talk of something else, dear Flora," said the much distressed Henry;
"you will make yourself much worse, if you indulge yourself in these strange
fancies."

     "Oh, that they were but fancies!"

     "They are, believe me."

     "There is a strange confusion in my brain, and sleep comes over me
suddenly, when I least expect it.  Henry, Henry, what I was, I shall never,
never be again."

     "Say not so.  All this will pass away like a dream, and leave so faint 
a
trace upon your memory, that the time will come when you will wonder it ever
made so deep an impression on your mind."

     "You utter these words, Henry, " she said, "but they do not come from
your heart.  Ah, no, no, no!  Who comes?"

     The door was opened by Mrs. Bannerworth, who said, -- 

     "It is only me, my dear.  Henry, here is Dr. Chillingworth in the
dining-room."

     Henry turned to Flora, saying, -- 

     "You will see him, dear Flora?  You know Mr. Chillingworth well."

     "Yes, Henry, yes, I will see him, or who-ever you please."

     "Shew Mr. Chillingworth up," said Henry to the servant.

     In a few moments the medical man was in the room, and he at once
approached the bedside to speak to Flora, upon whose pale countenance he
looked with evident interest, while at the same time it seemed mingled with 
a
painful feeling -- at least so his own face indicated.

     "Well, Miss Bannerworth," he said, "what is all this I hear about an 
ugly
dream you have had?"

     "A dream?" said Flora, as she fixed her beautiful eyes on his face.

     "Yes, as I understand."

     She shuddered and was silent.

     "Was it not a dream, then?" added Mr. Chillingworth.

     She wrung her hands, and in a voice of extreme anguish and pathos, 
said,
--  

     "Would it were a dream-- would it were a dream!  Oh, if any one could 
but
convince me it was a dream!"

     "Well, will you tell me what it was?"

     "Yes, sir, it was a vampyre."

     Mr. Chillingworth glanced at Henry, as he said, in reply to Flora's
words, -- 

     "I suppose that is, after all, another name, Flora, for the nightmare?"

     "No-- no-- no!"

     "Do you really, then, persist in believing anything so absurd, Miss
Bannerworth?"

     "What can I say to the evidence of my own senses?" she replied.  "I saw
it, Henry saw it, George saw, Mr. Marchdale, my mother-- all saw it.  We 
could
not all be at the same time the victims of the same delusion."

     "How faintly you speak."

     "I am very faint and ill."

     "Indeed.  What wound is that on your neck?"

     A wild expression came over the face of Flora; a spasmodic action of 
the
muscles, accompanied with a shuddering, as if a sudden chill had come over 
the
whole mass of blood took place, and she said, -- 

     "It is the mark left by the teeth of the vampyre."

     The smile was a forced one upon the face of Mr. Chillingworth.

     "Draw up the blind of the window, Mr. Henry," he said, "and let me
examine this puncture to which your sister attaches so extraordinary a
meaning."

     The blind was drawn up, and a strong light was thrown into the room.  
For
full two minutes Mr. Chillingworth attentively examined the two small wounds
in the neck of Flora.  He took a powerful magnifying glass from his pocket,
and looked at them through it, and after his examination was concluded, he
said, --

     "They are very trifling wounds, indeed."

     "But how inflicted?" said Henry.

     "By some insect, I should say, which probably-- it being the season for
many insects-- has flown in at the window."

     "I know the motive," said Flora, "which prompts all these suggestions: 
it is a kind one, and I ought to be the last to quarrel with it; but what I
have seen, nothing can make me believe I saw not, unless I am, as once or
twice I have thought myself, really mad."

     "How do you now feel in general health?"

     "Far from well; and a strange drowsiness at times creeps over me.  Even
now I feel it."

     She sunk back on the pillows as she spoke, and closed her eyes with a
deep sigh.

     Mr. Chillingworth beckoned Henry to come with him from the room, but 
the
latter had promised that he would remain with Flora; and as Mrs. Bannerworth
had left the chamber because she was unable to control her feelings, he rang
the bell, and requested that his mother would come.

     She did so, and then Henry went down stairs along with the medical man,
whose opinion he was certainly eager to be now made acquainted with.

     As soon as they were alone in the old-fashioned room which was called 
the
oak closet, Henry turned to Mr. Chillingworth, and said, -- 

     "What, now, is your candid opinion, sir?  You have seen my sister, and
those strange indubitable evidences of something wrong."

     "I have; and to tell you candidly the truth, Mr. Henry, I am sorely
perplexed."

     "I thought you would be."

     "It is not often that a medical man likes to say so much, nor is it,
indeed, often prudent that he should do so, but in this case I own I am much
puzzled.  It is contrary to all my notions upon all such subjects."

     "Those wounds, what do you think of them?"

     "I know not what to think.  I am completely puzzled as regards them."

     "But, but do they not really bear the appearance of being bites?"

     "They really do."

     "And so far, then, they are actually in favour of the dreadful
supposition which poor Flora entertains."

     "So far they certainly are.  I have no doubt in the world of their 
being
bites; but we must not jump to a conclusion that the teeth which inflicted
them were human.  It is a strange case, and one which I feel assured must 
give
you all much uneasiness, as, indeed, it gave me; but, as I said before, I 
will
not let my judgment give in to the fearful and degrading superstition which
all the circumstances connected with this strange story would seem to
justify."

     "It is a degrading superstition."

     "To my mind your sister seems to be labouring under the effect of some
narcotic."

     "Indeed?"

     "Yes; unless she really has lost a quantity of blood, which loss has
decreased the heart's action sufficiently to produce the languor under which
she now evidently labours."

     "Oh, that I could believe the former supposition, but I am confident 
she
has taken no narcotic; she could not even do so by mistake, for there is no
drug of the sort in the house.  Besides, she is not heedless by any means.  
I
am quite convinced that she has not done so."

     "Then I am fairly puzzled, my young friend, and I can only say that I
would freely have given half of what I am worth to see that figure you saw
last night."

     "What would you have done?"

     "I would not have lost sight of it for the world's wealth."

     "You would have felt your blood freeze with horror.  The face was
terrible."

     "And yet let it lead me where it liked I would have followed."

     "I wish you had been here."

     "I wish to Heaven I had.  If I thought there was the least chance of
another visit I would come and wait with patience every night for a month."

     "I cannot say," replied Henry.  "I am going to sit up to-night with my
sister, and, I believe, our friend Mr. Marchdale will share my watch with 
me."

     Mr. Chillingworth appeared to be for a few moments lost in thought, and
then, suddenly rousing himself, as if he found it either impossible to come 
to
any rational conclusion upon the subject, or had arrived at one which he 
chose
to keep to himself, he said, -- 

     "Well, well, we must leave the matter at present as it stands.  Time 
may
accomplish something towards its development; but at present so palpable a
mystery I never came across, or a matter in which human calculation was so
completely foiled."

     "Nor I-- nor I."

     "I will send you some medicines, such as I think will be of service to
Flora, and depend upon seeing me by ten o'clock to-morrow morning."

     "You have, of course, heard something," said Henry to the doctor, as he
was pulling on his gloves, "about vampyres."

     "I certainly have, and I understand that in some countries, 
particularly
Norway and Sweden, the superstition is a very common one."

     "And in the Levant."

     "Yes.  The ghouls of the Mahometans are of the same description of
beings.  All that I have heard of the European vampyre has made it a being
which can be killed, but is restored to life again by the rays of a full 
moon
falling on the body."

     "Yes, yes, I have heard as much."

     "And that the hideous repast of blood has to be taken very frequently,
and that if the vampyre gets it not he wastes away, presenting the 
appearance
of one in the last stage of a consumption, and visibly, so to speak, dying."

     "That is what I have understood."

     "To-night, do you know, Mr. Bannerworth, is the full of the moon."

     Henry started.

     "If now you had succeeded in killing --.  Pshaw, what am I saying.  I
believe I am getting foolish, and that the horrible superstition is 
beginning
to fasten itself upon me as well as upon all of you.  How strangely the 
fancy
will wage war with the judgment in such a way as this."

     "The full of the moon," repeated Henry, as he glanced towards the 
window,
"and the night is near at hand."

     "Banish these thoughts from your  mind," said the doctor, "or else, my
young friend, you will make yourself decidedly ill.  Good evening to you, 
for
it is evening.  I shall see you to-morrow morning."

     Mr. Chillingworth appeared now to be anxious to go, and Henry no longer
opposed his departure; but when he was gone a sense of great loneliness came
over him.

     "To-night," he repeated, "is the full of the moon.  How strange that 
this
dreadful adventure should have taken place just the night before.  'Tis very
strange.  Let me see-- let me see."

     He took from the shelves of a book-case the work which Flora had
mentioned, entitled, "Travels in Norway," in which work he found some 
account
of the popular belief in vampyres.

     He opened the work at random, and then some of the leaves turned over 
of
themselves to a particular place, as the leaves will frequently do when it 
has
been kept open a length of time at that part, and the binding stretched 
there
more than anywhere else.  There was a note at the bottom of one of the pages
at this part of the book, and Henry read as follows: -- 

     "With regard to these vampyres, it is believed by those who are 
inclined
to give credence to so dreadful a superstition, that they always endeavour 
to
make their feast of blood, for the revival of their bodily powers, on some
evening immediately preceding a full moon, because if any accident befall
them, such as being shot, or otherwise killed or wounded, they can recover 
by
lying down somewhere where the full moon's rays will fall on them."

     Henry let the book drop from his hands with a groan and a shudder.

                                     -+-

 Next Time: The Night Watch. -- The Proposal. -- The Moonlight. -- The 
Fearful
 Adventure.



                                 CHAPTER V.

THE NIGHT WATCH. -- THE PROPOSAL. -- THE MOONLIGHT. -- THE FEARFUL 
ADVENTURE.

     A kind of stupefaction came over Henry Bannerworth, and he sat for 
about
a quarter of an hour scarcely conscious of where he was, and almost 
incapable
of anything in the shape of rational thought.  It was his brother, George, 
who
roused him by saying, as he laid his hand upon his shoulder, -- 

     "Henry, are you asleep?"

     Henry had not been aware of his presence, and he started up as if he 
had
been shot.

     "Oh, George, is it you?" he said.

     "Yes, Henry, are you unwell?"

     "No, no; I was in a deep reverie."

     "Alas, I need not ask upon what subject," said George, sadly.  "I 
sought
you to bring you this letter."

     "A letter to me?"

     "Yes, you see it is addressed to you, and the seal looks as if it came
from some one of consequence."

     "Indeed!"

     "Yes, Henry.  Read it, and see from whence it comes."

     There was just sufficient light by going to the window to enable Henry 
to
read the letter, which he did aloud.

     It ran thus: -- 

     "Sir Francis Varney presents his compliments to Mr. Beaumont, and is 
much
concerned to hear that some domestic affliction has fallen upon him.  Sir
Francis hopes that the genuine and loving sympathy of a neighbour will not 
be
regarded as an intrusion, and begs to proffer any assistance or counsel that
may be within the compass of his means.

     "Ratford Abbey."

     "Sir Francis Varney!" said Henry, "who is he?"

     "Do you not remember, Henry," said George, "we were told a few days 
ago,
that a gentleman of that name had become the purchaser of the estate of
Ratford Abbey."

     "Oh, yes, yes.  Have you seen him?"

     "I have not."

     "I do not wish to make any new acquaintance, George.  We are very poor-
-
much poorer indeed that the general appearance of this place, which, I fear,
we shall soon have to part with, would warrant any one believing.  I must, 
of
course, return a civil answer to this gentleman, but it must be such a one 
as
shall repress familiarity."

     "That will be difficult to do while we remain here, when we come to
consider the very close proximity of the two properties, Henry."

     "Oh, no, not at all.  He will easily perceive that we do not want to 
make
acquaintance with him, and then, as a gentleman, which doubtless he is, he
will give up the attempt."

     "Let it be so, Henry.  Heaven knows I have no desire to form any new
acquaintance with any one, and more particularly under our present
circumstances of depression.  And now, Henry, you must permit me, as I have
had some repose, to share with you your night watch in Flora's room."

     "I would advise you not, George; your health, as you know, is far from
good."

     "Nay, allow me.  If not, then the anxiety I shall suffer will do me 
more
harm than the watchfulness I shall keep up in her chamber."

     This was an argument which Henry felt himself the force of too strongly
not to admit it in the case of George, and he therefore made no further
opposition to his wish to make one in the night watch.

     "There will be an advantage," said George, "you see, in three of us 
being
engaged in this matter, because, should anything occur, two can act 
together,
and yet Flora may not be left alone."

     "True, true, that is a great advantage."

     Now a soft gentle silvery light began to spread itself over the 
heavens. 
The moon was rising, and as the beneficial effects of the storm of the
preceding evening were still felt in the clearness of the air, the rays
appeared to be more lustrous and full of beauty than they commonly were.

     Each moment the night grew lighter, and by the time the brothers were
ready to take their places in the chamber of Flora, the moon had risen
considerably.

     Although neither Henry nor George had any objection to the company of 
Mr.
Marchdale, yet they gave him the option, and rather in fact urged him not to
destroy his night's repose by sitting up with them; but he said -- 

     "Allow me to do so; I am older, and have calmer judgment than you can
have.  Should anything again appear, I am quite resolved that it shall not
escape me."

     "What would you do?"

     "With the name of God upon my lips," said Mr. Marchdale, solemnly, "I
would grapple with it."

     "You laid hands upon it last night."

     "I did, and have forgotten to show you what I tore from it.  Look here,
-- what should you say this was?"

     He produced a piece of cloth, on which was an old-fashioned piece of
lace, and two buttons.  Upon a close inspection, this appeared to be a 
portion
of the lappel of a coat of ancient times, and suddenly, Henry, with a look 
of
intense anxiety, said, -- 

     "This reminds me of the fashion of garments very many years ago, Mr.
Marchdale."

     "It came away in my grasp as if rotten and incapable of standing any
rough usage."

     "What a strange unearthly smell it has!"

     "Now that you mention it yourself," added Mr. Marchdale, "I must 
confess
it smells to me as if it had really come from the very grave."

     "It does -- it does.  Say nothing of this relic of last night's work to
any one."

     "Be assured I shall not.  I am far from wishing to keep up in any one's
mind proofs of that which I would fain, very fain refute."

     Mr. Marchdale replaced the portion of the coat which the figure had 
worn
in his pocket, and then the whole three proceeded to the chamber of Flora.

                *           *           *           *           *

     It was within a very few minutes of midnight, the moon had climbed high
in the heavens, and a night of such brightness and beauty had seldom shown
itself for a long period of time.

     Flora slept, and in her chamber sat the two brothers and Mr. Marchdale,
silently, for she had shown symptoms of restlessness, and they much feared 
to
break the light slumber into which she had fallen.

     Occasionally they had conversed in whispers, which could not have the
effect of rousing her, for the room, although smaller than the one she had
before occupied, was still sufficiently spacious to enable them to get some
distance from the bed.

     Until the hour of midnight now actually struck, they were silent, and
when the last echo of the sounds had died away, a feeling of uneasiness came
over them, which prompted some conversation to get rid of it.

     "How bright the moon is now," said Henry in a low tone.

     "I never saw it brighter," replied Marchdale.  "I feel as if I were
assured that we shall not to-night be interrupted."

     "It was later than this," said Henry.

     "Do not then yet congratulate us upon no visit."

     "How still the house is!" remarked George; "it seems to me as if I had
never found it so intensely quiet before."

     "It is very still."

     "Hush! she moves."

     Flora moaned in her sleep, and made a slight movement.  The curtains 
were
all drawn closely round the bed to shield her eyes from the bright moonlight
which streamed into the room so brilliantly.  They might have closed the
shutters of the window, but this they did not like to do, as it would render
their watch there of no avail at all, inasmuch as they would not be able to
see if any attempt was made by any one to obtain admittance.

     A quarter of an hour longer might have thus passed when Mr. Marchdale
said in a whisper -- 

     "A thought has just stuck me that the piece of coat I have, which I
dragged from the figure last night, wonderfully resembles in colour and
appearance the style of dress of the portrait in the room which Flora lately
slept in."

     "I thought of that," said Henry, "when first I saw it; but, to tell the
honest truth, I dreaded to suggest any new proof connected with last night's
visitation."

     "Then I ought not to have drawn your attention to it," said Mr.
Marchdale, "and regret I have done so." 

     "Nay, do not blame yourself on such an account," said Henry.  "You are
quite right, and it is I who am too foolishly sensitive.  Now, however, 
since
you have mentioned it, I must own I have a great desire to test the accuracy
of the observation by a comparison with the portrait."

     "That may easily be done."

     "I will remain here," said George, "in case Flora awakens, while you 
two
go if you like.  It is but across the corridor."

     Henry immediately rose, saying -- 

     "Come, Mr. Marchdale, come.  Let us satisfy ourselves at all events 
upon
this point at once.  As George says it is only across the corridor, and we 
can
return directly."

     "I am willing," said Mr. Marchdale, with a tone of sadness.

     There was no light needed, for the moon stood suspended in a cloudless
sky, so that from the house being a detached one, and containing numerous
windows, it was as light as day.

     Although the distance from one chamber to the other was only across the
corridor, it was a greater space than these words might occupy, for the
corridor was wide, neither was it directly across, but considerably 
slanting. 
However, it was certainly sufficiently close at hand for any sound of alarm
from one chamber to reach the other without any difficulty.

     A few moments sufficed to place Henry and Mr. Marchdale in that antique
room, where, from the effect of the moonlight which was streaming over it, 
the
portrait on the panel looked exceedingly life like.

     And this effect was probably the greater because the rest of the room 
was
not illuminated by the moon's rays, which came through a window in the
corridor, and then at the open door of that chamber upon the portrait.

     Mr. Marchdale held the piece of cloth he had close to the dress of the
portrait, and one glance was sufficient to show the wonderful likeness 
between
the two.

     "Good God!" said Henry, "it is the same!"

     Mr. Marchdale dropped the piece of cloth and trembled.

     "This fact shakes even your scepticism," said Henry.

     "I know not what to make of it."

     "I can tell you something which bears upon it.  I do not know if you 
are
sufficiently aware of my family history to know that this one of my 
ancestors,
I wish I could say worthy ancestors, committed suicide, and was buried in 
his
clothes."

     "You -- you are sure of that?"

     "Quite sure."

     "I am more and more bewildered as each moment some strange 
corroborative
fact of that dreadful supposition we so much shrink from seems to come to
light and to force itself upon our attention."

     There was a silence of a few moments duration, and Henry had turned
towards Mr. Marchdale to say something, when the cautious tread of a 
footstep
was heard in the garden, immediately beneath that balcony.

     A sickening sensation came over Henry, and he was compelled to lean
against the wall for support, as in scarcely articulate accents he said -- 

     "The vampyre-- the vampyre!  God of heaven, it has come once again!"

     "Now, Heaven inspire us with more than mortal courage," cried Mr.
Marchdale, and he dashed open the window at once, and sprang into the 
balcony.

     Henry in a moment recovered himself sufficiently to follow him, and 
when
he reached his side in the balcony, Marchdale said, as he pointed below, -- 

     "There is some one concealed there."

     "Where-- where?"

     "Among the laurels.  I will fire a random shot, and we may do some
execution."

     "Hold!" said a voice from below; "don't do any such thing, I beg of 
you."

     "Why, that is Mr. Chillingworth's voice," cried Henry.

     "Yes, and it's Mr. Chillingworth's person, too," said the doctor, as he
emerged from among some laurel bushes.

     "How is this?" said Marchdale.

     "Simply that I made up my mind to keep watch and ward to-night outside
here, in the hope of catching the vampyre.  I got into here by climbing the
gate."

     "But why did you not let me know?" said Henry.

     "Because I did not know myself, my young friend, till an hour and a 
half
ago."

     "Have you seen anything?"

     "Nothing.  But I fancied I heard something in the park outside the 
wall."

     "Indeed!"

     "What say you, Henry," said Mr. Marchdale, "to descending and taking a
hasty examination of the garden and grounds?"

     "I am willing; but first allow me to speak to George, who otherwise 
might
be surprised at our long absence."

     Henry walked rapidly to the bed-chamber of Flora, and he said to 
George,
-- 

     "Have you any objection to being left alone here for about half an 
hour,
George, while we make an examination of the garden?"

     "Let me have some weapon and I care not.  Remain here while I fetch a
sword from my own room."

     Henry did so, and when George returned with a sword, which he always 
kept
in his bed-room, he said, --

    "Now go, Henry.  I prefer a weapon of this description to pistols much. 
Do not be gone longer than necessary."

     "I will not, George, be assured."

     George was then left alone, and Henry returned to the balcony, where 
Mr.
Marchdale was waiting for him.  It was a quicker mode of descending to the
garden to do so by clambering over the balcony than any other, and the 
height
was not considerable enough to make it very objectionable, so Henry and Mr.
Marchdale chose that way of joining Mr. Chillingworth.

     "You are, no doubt, much surprised at finding me here," said the 
doctor;
"but the fact is, I half made up my mind to come while I was here; but I had
not thoroughly done so, therefore I said nothing to you about it."

     "We are much indebted to you," said Henry, "for making the attempt."

     "I am prompted to it by a feeling of the strongest curiosity."

     "Are you armed, sir?" said Marchdale.

     "In this stick," said the doctor, "is a sword, the exquisite temper of
which I know I can depend upon, and I fully intended to run through any one
whom I saw that looked in the least of the vampyre order."

     "You would have done quite right," replied Mr. Marchdale.  "I have a
brace of pistols here, loaded with ball; will you take one, Henry, if you
please, and then we shall be all armed."

     Thus, then, prepared for any exigency, they made the whole round of the
house; but found all the fastenings secure, and everything as quiet as
possible.

     "Suppose, now, we take a survey of the park outside the garden wall,"
said Mr. Marchdale.

     This was agreed to; but before they had proceeded far, Mr. Marchdale
said, -- 

     "There is a ladder lying on the wall; would it not be a good plan to
place it against the very spot the supposed vampyre jumped over last night,
and so, from a more elevated position, take a view of the open meadows.  We
could easily drop down on the outer side, if we saw anything suspicious."

     "Not a bad plan," said the doctor.  "Shall we do it?"

     "Certainly," said Henry; and they accordingly carried the ladder, which
had been used for pruning the trees, towards the spot at the end of the long
walk, at which the vampyre had made good, after so many fruitless efforts, 
his
escape from the premises.

     Then made haste down the long vista of trees until they reached the 
exact
spot, and then they placed the ladder as near as possible, exactly where
Henry, in his bewilderment on the evening before, had seen the apparition 
from
the grave spring to.

     "We can ascend singly," said Marchdale; "but there is ample space for 
us
all there to sit on the top of the wall and make our observations."

     This was seen to be the case, and in about a couple of minutes they had
taken up their position on the wall, and, although the height was but
trifling, they found that they had a much more extensive view than they 
could
have obtained by any other means.

     "To contemplate the beauty of such a night as this," said Mr.
Chillingworth, "is amply sufficient compensation for coming the distance I
have."

     "And who knows," remarked Marchdale, "we may yet see something which 
may
throw a light upon our present perplexities?  God knows that I would give 
all
I can call mine in the world to relieve you and your sister, Henry
Bannerworth, from the fearful effect which last night's proceedings cannot
fail to have upon you."

     "Of that I am well assured, Mr. Marchdale," said Henry.  "If the
happiness of myself and family depended upon you, we should be happy 
indeed."

     "You are silent, Mr. Chillingworth," remarked Marchdale, after a slight
pause.

     "Hush!" said Mr. Chillingworth -- "hush -- hush!"

     "Good God, what do you hear?" cried Henry.

     The doctor laid his hand upon Henry's arm as he said, -- 

     "There is a young lime tree yonder to the right."

     "Yes -- yes."

     "Carry your eye from it in a horizontal line, as near as you can, 
towards
the wood."

     Henry did so, and then he uttered a sudden exclamation of surprise, and
pointed to a rising spot of ground, which was yet, in consequence of the
number of tall trees in its vicinity, partially enveloped in shadow.

     "What is that?" he said.

     "I see something," said Marchdale.  "By Heaven! it is a human form 
lying
stretched there."

     "It is -- as if in death."

     "What can it be?" said Chillingworth.

     "I dread to say," replied Marchdale; "but to my eyes, even at this
distance, it seems like the form of him we chased last night."

     "The vampyre?"

     "Yes -- yes.  Look, the moonbeams touch him.  Now the shadows of the
trees gradually recede.  God of Heaven! the figure moves."

     Henry's eyes were rivetted to that fearful object, and now a scene
presented itself which filled them all with wonder and astonishment,
mingled with sensations of the greatest awe and alarm.

     As the moonbeams, in consequence of the luminary rising higher and 
higher
in the heavens, came to touch this figure that lay extended on the rising
ground, a perceptible movement took place in it.  The limbs appeared to
tremble, and although it did not rise up, the whole body gave signs of
vitality.

     "The vampyre -- the vampyre!" said Mr. Marchdale.  "I cannot doubt it
now.  We must have hit him last night with the pistol bullets, and the
moonbeams are now restoring him to a new life."

     Henry shuddered, and even Mr. Chillingworth turned pale.  But he was 
the
first to recover himself sufficiently to propose some course of action, and 
he
said, -- 

     "Let us descend and go up to this figure.  It is a duty we owe to
ourselves as much as to society."

     "Hold a moment," said Mr. Marchdale, as he produced a pistol.  "I am an
unerring shot, as you well know, Henry.  Before we move from this position 
we
now occupy, allow me to try what virtue may be in a bullet to lay that 
figure
low again."

     "He is rising!" exclaimed Henry.

     Mr. Marchdale levelled the pistol -- he took sure and deliberate aim, 
and
then, just as the figure seemed to be struggling to its feet, he fired, and,
with a sudden bound, it fell again.
     
     "You have hit it," said Henry.

     "You have indeed," exclaimed the doctor.  "I think we can go now."

     "Hush!" said Marchdale -- "Hush!  Does it not seem to you that, hit it 
as
often as you will, the moonbeams will recover it?"

     "Yes -- yes," said Henry, "they will -- they will."

     "I can endure this no longer," said Mr. Chillingworth, as he sprung 
from
the wall.  "Follow me or not, as you please, I will seek the spot where this
being lies."

     "Oh, be not rash," cried Marchdale.  "See, it rises again, and its form
looks gigantic."

     "I trust in Heaven and a righteous cause," said the doctor, as he drew
the sword he had spoken of from the stick, and threw away the scabbard.  
"Come
with me if you like, or I go alone."

     Henry at once jumped down from the wall, and then Marchdale followed 
him,
saying, -- 

     "Come on; I will not shrink."

     They ran towards the piece of rising ground; but before they got to it,
the form rose and made rapidly towards a little wood which was in the
immediate neighbourhood of the hillock.

     "It is conscious of being pursued," cried the doctor.  "See how it
glances back, and then increases its speed."

     "Fire upon it, Henry," said Marchdale.

     He did so; but either his shot did not take effect, or it was quite
unheeded, if it did, by the vampyre, which gained the wood before they could
have a hope of getting sufficiently near it to effect, or endeavour to 
effect,
a capture.

     "I cannot follow it there," said Marchdale.  "In open country I would
have pursued it closely; but I cannot follow it into the intricacies of a
wood."

     "Pursuit is useless there," said Henry.  "It is enveloped in the 
deepest
gloom."

     "I am not so unreasonable," remarked Mr. Chillingworth, "as to wish you
to follow into such a place as that.  I am confounded utterly by this 
affair."

     "And I," said Marchdale.  "What on earth is to be done?"

     "Nothing -- nothing!" exclaimed Henry, vehemently; "and yet I have,
beneath the canopy of Heaven, declared that I will, so help me God! spare
neither time nor trouble in the unravelling of this most fearful piece of
business.  Did either of you remark the clothing which this spectral
appearance wore?"

     "They were antique clothes," said Mr. Chillingworth, "such as might 
have
been fashionable a hundred years ago, but not now."

     "Such was my own impression," added Marchdale.

     "And such my own," said Henry, excitedly.  "Is it at all within the
compass of the wildest belief that what we have seen is a vampyre, and no
other than my ancestor who, a hundred years ago, committed suicide?"

     There was so much intense excitement, and evidence of mental suffering,
that Mr. Chillingworth took him by the arm, saying, -- 

     "Come home -- come home; no more of this at present; you will make
yourself seriously unwell."

     "No-- no-- no."

     "Come home-- come home; I pray you; you are by far too much excited 
about
this matter to pursue it with the calmness which should be brought to bear
upon it."

     "Take advice, Henry," said Marchdale, "take advice, and come home at
once."

     "I will yield to you; I feel that I cannot control my own feelings-- I
will yield to you, who, as you say, are cooler on this subject than I can 
be. 
Oh, Flora, Flora, I have no comfort for you now."

     Poor Henry Bannerworth appeared to be in a complete state of mental
prostration, on account of the distressing circumstances that had occurred 
so
rapidly and so suddenly in his family, which had had quite enough to contend
with without having superadded to every other evil the horror of believing
that some preternatural agency was at work to destroy every hope of future
happiness in this world, under any circumstances.

     He suffered himself to be led home by Mr. Chillingworth and Marchdale; 
he
no longer attempted to dispute the dreadful fact concerning the supposed
vampyre; he could not contend now against all the corroborating 
circumstances
that seemed to collect together for the purpose of proving that which, even
when proved, was contrary to all his notions of Heaven, and at variance with
all that was recorded and established as part and parcel of the system of
nature.

     "I cannot deny," he said, when they had reached home, "that such things
are possible; but the probability will not bear a moment's investigation."

     "There are more things," said Marchdale, "in Heaven, and on earth, than
are dreamed in our philosophy."

     "There are indeed, it appears," said Mr. Chillingworth.

     "Are you a convert?" said Henry, turning to him.

     "A convert to what?"

     "To a belief in -- in -- these vampyres?"

     "I?  No, indeed; if you were to shut me up in a room full of vampyres, 
I
would tell them all to their teeth that I defied them."

     "But after what we have seen to-night?"

     "What have we seen?"

     "You are yourself a witness."

     "True; I saw a man lying down, and then I saw a man get up; he seemed
then to be shot, but whether he was or not he only knows; and then I saw him
walk off in a desperate hurry.  Beyond that, I saw nothing."

     "Yes; but, taking such circumstances into combination with others, have
you not a terrible fear of the truth of the dreadful appearance?"

     "No -- no; on my soul, no.  I will die in my disbelief of such an 
outrage
upon Heaven as one of these creatures would most assuredly be."

     "Oh! that I could think like you; but the circumstance strikes too 
nearly
to my heart."

     "Be of better cheer, Henry -- be of better cheer," said Marchdale; 
"there
is one circumstance which we ought to consider, it is that, from all we have
seen, there seems to be some things which would favour an opinion, Henry, 
that
your ancestor, whose portrait hangs in the chamber which was occupied by
Flora, is a vampyre."

     "The dress is the same," said Henry.

     "I noted it was."

     "And I."

     "Do you not, then, think it possible that something might be done to 
set
that part of the question at rest?"

     "What -- what?"

     "Where is your ancestor buried?"

     "Ah! I understand you now."

     "And I," said Mr. Chillingworth; "you would propose a visit to his
mansion?"

     "I would," added Marchdale; "anything that may in any way tend to 
assist
in making this affair clearer, and divesting it of its mysterious
circumstances, will be most desirable."

     Henry appeared to rouse for some moments, and then he said, -- 

     "He, in common with many other members of the family, no doubt occupies 
a
place in the vault under the old church in the village."

     "Would it be possible," asked Marchdale, "to get into that vault 
without
exciting general attention?"

     "It would," said Henry; "the entrance to the vault is in the flooring 
of
the pew which belongs to the family in the old church."

     "Then it could be done?" asked Mr. Chillingworth.

     "Most undoubtedly."

     "Will you undertake such an adventure?" said Mr. Chillingworth.  "It 
may
ease your mind."

     "He was buried in the vault, and in his clothes," said Henry, musingly;
"I will think of it.  About such a proposition I would not decide hastily. 
Give me leave to think of it until to-morrow."

     "Most certainly."

     They now made their way to the chamber of Flora, and they heard from
George that nothing of an alarming character had occurred to disturb him on
his lonely watch.  The morning was now again dawning, and Henry earnestly
entreated Mr. Marchdale to go to bed, which he did, leaving the two brothers
to continue as sentinels by Flora's bed-side, until the morning light should
banish all uneasy thoughts.

     Henry related to George what had taken place outside the house, and the
two brothers held a long and interesting conversation for some hours upon 
that
subject, as well as upon others of great importance to their welfare.  It 
was
not until the sun's early rays came glaring in at the casement that they 
both
rose, and thought of awakening Flora, who had now slept soundly for so many
hours.

 Next Time: A Glance at the Bannerworth Family. -- The Probable Consequences
 of the Mysterious Apparition's Appearance.




                                 Chapter VI.

A GLANCE AT THE BANNERWORTH FAMILY. -- THE PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES OF THE
MYSTERIOUS APPARITION'S APPEARANCE.


     Having thus far, we hope, interested our readers in the fortunes of a
family which had become subject to so dreadful a visitation, we trust that a
few words concerning them, and the peculiar circumstances in which they are
now placed, will not prove altogether out of place, or unacceptable.  The
Bannerworth family then were well known in the part of the country where 
they
resided.  Perhaps, if we were to say they were better known by name than 
they
were liked, on account of that name, we should be near the truth, for it had
unfortunately happened that for a very considerable time past the head of 
the
family had been the very worst specimen of it that could be procured.  While
the junior branches were frequently amiable and most intelligent, and such 
in
mind and manner as were calculated to inspire goodwill in all who knew them,
he who held the family property, and who resided in the house now occupied 
by
Flora and her brothers, was a very so-so sort of character.

     This state of things, by some strange fatality, had gone on for nearly 
a
hundred years, and the consequence was what might have been fairly expected,
namely -- that, what with their vices and what with their extravagancies, 
the
successive heads of the Bannerworth family had succeeded in so far 
diminishing
the family property that, when it came into the hands of Henry Bannerworth, 
it
was of little value, on account of the numerous encumbrances with which it 
was
saddled.

     The father of Henry had not been a very brilliant exception to the
general rule, as regarded the head of the family.  If he were not quite so 
bad
as many of his ancestors, that gratifying circumstance was to be accounted 
for
by the supposition that he was not quite so bold, and that the changes in
habits, manners, and laws, which had taken place in a hundred years, made it
not so easy for even a landed proprietor to play the petty tyrant.

     He had, to get rid of those animal spirits which had prompted many of 
his
predecessors to downright crimes, had recourse to the gaming table, and, 
after
raising whatever sums he could upon the property which remained, he 
naturally,
and as might have been fully expected, lost them all.

     He was found lying dead in the garden of the house one day, and by his
side was his pocket-book, on one leaf of which, it was the impression of the
family, he had endeavoured to write something previous to his decease, for 
he
held a pencil firmly in his grasp.

     The probability was that he had felt himself getting ill, and, being
desirous of making some communication to his family which pressed heavily 
upon
his mind, he had attempted to do so, but was stopped by the too rapid 
approach
of the hand of death.

     For some days previous to his decease, his conduct had been extremely
mysterious.  He had announced an intention of leaving England for ever -- of
selling the house and grounds for whatever they would fetch over and above 
the
sums for which they were mortgaged, and so clearing himself of all
encumbrances.

     He had, but a few hours before he was found lying dead, made the
following singular speech to Henry, -- 

     "Do not regret, Henry, that the old house which has been in our family 
so
long is about to be parted with.  Be assured that, if it is but for the 
first
time in my life, I have good and substantial reasons now for what I am about
to do.  We shall be able to go to some other country, and there live like
princes of the land."

     Where the means were to come from to live like a prince, unless Mr.
Bannerworth had some of the German princes in his eye, no one knew but
himself, and his sudden death buried with him dhat most important secret.

     There were some words written on the leaf of his pocket-book, but they
were of by far too indistinct and ambiguous a nature to lead to anything. 
They were these: -- 

     "The money is-----"

     And then there was a long scrawl of the pencil, which seemed to have 
been
occasioned by his sudden decease.

     Of course nothing could be made of these words, except in the way of a
contradiction, as the family lawyer said, rather more facetiously than a man
of law usually speaks, for if he had written "The money is not," he would 
have
been somewhere remarkably near the truth.

     However, with all his vices he was regretted by his children, who chose
rather to remember him in his best aspect than to dwell upon his faults.

     For the first time then, within the memory of man, the head of the 
family
of the Bannerworths was a gentleman, in every sense of the word.  Brave,
generous, highly educated, and full of many excellent and noble qualities --
for such was Henry, whom we have introduced to our readers under such
distressing circumstances.

     And now, people said, that the family property having been all 
dissipated
and lost, there would take place a change, and that the Bannerworths would
have to take some course of honourable industry for a livelihood, and that
then they would be as much respected as they had before been detested and
disliked.

     Indeed, the position which Henry held was now a most precarious one --
for one of the amazingly clever acts of his father had been to encumber the
property with overwhelming claims, so that when Henry administered to the
estate, it was doubted almost by his attorney if it were at all desirable to
do so.

     An attachment, however, to the old house of his family, had induced the
young man to hold possession of it as long as he could, despite any adverse
circumstance which might eventually be connected with it.

     Some weeks, however, only after the decease of his father, and when he
fairly held possession, a sudden and a most unexpected offer came to him 
from
a solicitor in London, of whom he knew nothing, to purchase the house and
grounds, for a client of his, who had instructed him so to do, but whom he 
did
not mention.

     The offer made was a liberal one, and beyond the value of the place.

     The lawyer who had conducted Henry's affairs for him since his father's
decease, advised him by all means to take it; but after a consultation with
his mother and sister, and George, they all resolved to hold by their own
house as long as they could, and, consequently, he refused the offer.

     He was then asked to let the place, and to name his own price for the
occupation of it; but that he would not do:  so the negotiation went off
altogether, leaving only, in the minds of the family, much surprise at the
exceeding eagerness of some one, whom they knew not, to get possession of 
the
place on any terms.

     There was another circumstance perhaps which materially aided in
producing a strong feeling on the minds of the Bannerworths, with regard to
remaining where they were.

     That circumstance occurred thus:  a relation of the family, who was now
dead, and with whom had died all his means, had been in the habit, for the
last half dozen years of his life, of sending a hundred pounds to Henry, for
the express purpose of enabling him and his brother George and his sister
Flora to take a little continental or home tour, in the autumn of the year.

     A more acceptable present, or for a more delightful purpose, to young
people, could not be found;  and, with the quiet, prudent habits of all 
three
of them, they contrived to go far and to see much for the sum which was thus
handsomely placed at their disposal.

     In one of those excursions, when among the mountains of Italy, an
adventure occurred which placed the life of Flora in imminent hazard.

     They were riding along a narrow mountain path, and, her horse slipping,
she fell over the ledge of a precipice.

     In an instant, a young man, a stranger to the whole party, who was
travelling in the vicinity, rushed to the spot, and by his knowledge and
exertions, they felt convinced her preservation was effected.

     He told her to lie quiet; he encouraged her to hope for immediate
succour; and then, with much personal exertion, and at immense risk to
himself, he reached the ledge of rock on which she lay, and then he 
supported
her until the brothers had gone to a neighbouring house, which, by-the-bye,
was two good English miles off, and got assistance.

     There came on, while they were gone, a terrific storm, and Flora felt
that but for him who was with her she must have been hurled from the rock, 
and
perished in an abyss below, which was almost too deep for observation.

     Suffice it to say that she was rescued; and he who had, by his
intrepidity, done so much towards saving her, was loaded with the most 
sincere
and heartfelt acknowledgments by the brothers as well as by herself.

     He frankly told them that his name was Holland; that he was travelling
for amusement and instruction, and was by profession an artist.

     He travelled with them for some time; and it was not at all to be
wondered at, under the circumstances, that an attachment of the tenderest
nature should spring up between him and the beautiful girl, who felt that 
she
owed to him her life.

     Mutual glances of affection were exchanged between them, and it was
arranged that when he returned to England, he should come at once as an
honoured guest to the house of the family of the Bannerworths.

     All this was settled satisfactorily with the full knowledge and
acquiescence of the two brothers, who had taken a strange attachment to the
young Charles Holland, who was indeed in every way likely to propitiate the
good opinion of all who knew him.

     Henry explained to him exactly how they were situated, and told him 
that
when he came he would find a welcome from all, except possibly his father,
whose wayward temper he could not answer for.

     Young Holland stated that he was compelled to be away for a term of two
years, from certain family arrangements he had entered into, and that then 
he
would return and hope to meet Flora unchanged as he should be.

     It happened that this was the last of the continental excursions of the
Bannerworths, for, before another year rolled round, the generous relative
who had supplied them with the means of making such delightful trips was no
more; and, likewise, the death of the father had occurred in the manner we
have related, so that there was no chance, as had been anticipated and hoped
for by Flora, of meeting Charles Holland on the continent again, before his
two years of absence from England should be expired.

     Such, however, being the state of things, Flora felt reluctant to give 
up
the house, where he would be sure to come to look for her, and her happiness
was too dear to Henry to induce him to make any sacrifice of it to 
expediency.

     Therefore was it that Bannerworth Hall, as it was sometimes called, was
retained, and fully intended to be retained at all events until after 
Charles
Holland had made his appearance, and his advice (for he was, by the young
people, considered one of the family) taken, with regard to what was 
advisable
to be done.

     With one exception this was the state of affairs at the hall, and that
exception relates to Mr. Marchdale.

     He was a distant relation of Mrs. Bannerworth, and, early in life, had
been sincerely and tenderly attached to her.  She, however, with the want of
steady reflection of a young girl, as she then was, had, as is generally the
case among several admirers, chosen the very worst:  that is, the man who 
had
treated her with the most indifference and who paid her the least attention,
was, of course, thought the most of, and she gave her hand to him.

     That man was Mr. Bannerworth.  But future experience had made her
thoroughly awake to her former error; and, but for the love she bore her
children, who were certainly all that a mother's heart could wish, she would
often have deeply regretted the infatuation which had induced her to bestow
her hand in the quarter she had done so.

     About a month after the decease of Mr. Bannerworth, there came one to 
the
hall, who desired to see the widow.  That one was Mr. Marchdale.

     It might have been some slight tenderness towards him which had never
left her, or it might be the pleasure merely of seeing one whom she had 
known
intimately in early life, but, be that as it may, she certainly gave him a
kindly welcome; and he, after consenting to remain for some time as a 
visitor
at the hall, won the esteem of the whole family by his frank demeanour and
cultivated intellect.

     He had travelled much and seen much, and he had turned to good account
all he had seen, that not only was Mr. Marchdale a man of sterling sound
sense, but he was a most entertaining companion.

     His intimate knowledge of many things concerning which they knew little
or nothing; his accurate modes of thought, and a quiet, gentlemanly 
demeanour,
such as is rarely to be met with, combined to make him esteemed by the
Bannerworths.  He had a small independence of his own, and being completely
alone in the world, for he had neither wife nor child, Marchdale owned that 
he
felt a pleasure in residing with the Bannerworths.

     Of course he could not, in decent terms, so far offend them as to offer
to pay for his subsistence, but he took good care that they should really be
no losers by having him as an inmate, a matter which he could easily arrange
by little presents of one kind and another, all of which he managed should 
be
such as were not only ornamental, but actually spared his kind entertainers
some positive expense which otherwise they must have gone to.

     Whether or not this amiable piece of manoeuvring was seen through by 
the
Bannerworths it is not our purpose to inquire.  If it was seen through, it
could not lower him in their esteem, for it was probably just what they
themselves would have felt a pleasure in doing under similar circumstances,
and if they did not observe it, Mr. Marchdale would, probably, be all the
better pleased.

     Such then may be considered by our readers as a brief outline of the
state of affairs among the Bannerworths -- a state which was pregnant with
changes, and which changes were now likely to be rapid and conclusive.

     How far the feelings of the family towards the ancient house of their
race would be altered by the appearance at it of so fearful a visitor as a
vampyre, we will not stop to inquire, inasmuch as such feelings will develop
themselves as we proceed.

     That the visitation had produced a serious effect upon all the 
household
was sufficiently evident, as well among the educated as among the ignorant. 
On the second morning, Henry received notice to quit his service from the
three servants he had with difficulty contrived to keep at the hall.  The
reason why he received such notice he knew well enough, and therefore he did
not trouble himself to argue about a superstition to which he felt now 
himself
almost compelled to give way; for how could he say there was no such thing 
as
a vampyre, when he had, with his own eyes, had the most abundant evidence of
the terrible fact?

     He calmly paid the servants, and allowed them to leave him at once
without at all entering into the matter, and, for the time being, some men
were procured, who, however, came evidently with fear and trembling, and
probably only took the place, on account of not being able to procure any
other.  The comfort of the household was likely to be completely put an end
to, and reasons now for leaving the hall appeared to be most rapidly 
accumulating.

 Next Time: The Visit to the Vault of the Bannerworths, and Its Unpleasant
 Result. -- The Mystery.




                                CHAPTER VII.

THE VISIT TO THE VAULT OF THE BANNERWORTHS, AND ITS UNPLEASANT RESULT. -- 
THE
MYSTERY.


     Henry and his brother roused Flora, and after agreeing together that it
would be highly imprudent to say anything to her of the proceedings of the
night, they commenced a conversation with her in encouraging and kindly
accents.

     "Well, Flora," said Henry, "you see you have been quite undisturbed
to-night."

     "I have slept long, dear Henry."

     "You have, and pleasantly too, I hope."

     "I have not had any dreams, and I feel much refreshed, now, and quite
well again."

     "Thank Heaven!" said George.

     "If you will tell dear mother that I am awake, I will get up with her
assistance."

     The brothers left the room, and they spoke to each other of it as a
favourable sign, that Flora did not object to being left alone now, as she 
had
done on the preceding morning.

     "She is fast recovering, now, George," said Henry.  "If we could now 
but
persuade ourselves that all this alarm would pass away, and that we should
hear no more of it, we might return to our old and comparatively happy
condition."

     "Let us believe, Henry, that we shall."

     "And yet, George, I shall not be satisfied in my mind, until I have 
paid
a visit."

     "A visit?  Where?"

     "To the family vault."

     "Indeed, Henry!  I thought you had abandoned that idea."

     "I had.  I have several times abandoned it; but it comes across my mind
again and again."

     "I much regret it."

     "Look you, George; as yet, everything that has happened has tended to
confirm a belief in this most horrible of all superstitions concerning
vampyres."

     "It has."

     "Now, my great object, George, is to endeavour to disturb such a state 
of
thing, by getting something, however slight, or of a negative character, for
the mind to rest upon on the other side of the question."

     "I comprehend you, Henry."

     "You know that at present we are not only led to believe, almost
irresistibly, that we have been visited by a vampyre, but that that vampyre 
is
our ancestor, whose portrait is on the panel of the wall of the chamber into
which he contrived to make his way."

     "True, most true."

     "Then let us, by an examination of the family vault, George, put an end
to one of the evidences.  If we find, as most surely we shall, the coffin of
the ancestor of ours, who seems, in dress and appearance, so horribly mixed 
up
in this affair, we shall be at rest on that head."

     "But consider how many years have elapsed."

     "Yes, a great number."

     "What then, do you suppose, could remain of any corpse placed in a 
vault
so long ago?"

     "Decomposition must of course have done its work, but still there must 
be
a something to show that a corpse has so undergone the process common to all
nature.  Double the lapse of time surely could not obliterate all traces of
that which had been."

     "There is reason in that, Henry."

     "Besides, the coffins are all of lead, and some of stone, so that they
cannot have all gone."

     "True, most true."

     "If in the one which, from the inscription and date, we discover to be
that of our ancestor whom we seek, we find the evident remains of a corpse, 
we
shall be satisfied that he has rested in his tomb in peace."

     "Brother, you seem bent on this adventure," said George; "if you go, I
will accompany you."

     "I will not engage rashly in it, George.  Before I finally decide, I 
will
again consult with Mr. Marchdale.  His opinion will weigh much with me."

     "And in good time, here he comes across the garden," said George, as he
looked from the window of the room in which they sat.

     It was Mr. Marchdale, and the brothers warmly welcomed him as he 
entered
the apartment.

     "You have been early afoot," said Henry.

     "I have," he said.  "The fact is, that although at your solicitation I
went to bed, I could not sleep, and I went out once more to search about the
spot where we had seen the -- the I don't know what to call it, for I have a
great dislike to naming it a vampyre."

     "There is not much in a name," said George.

     "In this instance there is," said Marchdale.  "It is a name suggestive 
of
horror."

     "Made you any discovery?" said Henry.

     "None whatever."

     "You saw no trace of any one?"

     "Not the least."

     "Well, Mr. Marchdale, George and I were talking over this projected 
visit
to the family vault."

     "Yes."

     "And we agreed to suspend our judgments until we saw you, and learned
your opinion."

     "Which I will tell you frankly," said Mr. Marchdale, "because I know 
you
desire it freely."

     "Do so."

     "It is, you should make the visit."

     "Indeed."

     "Yes, and for this reason.  You have now, as you cannot help having, a
disagreeable feeling, that you may find that one coffin is untenanted.  Now,
if you do fine it so, you scarcely make matters worse, by an additional
confirmation of what already amounts to a strong supposition, and one which 
is
likely to grow stronger by time."

     "True, most true."

     "On the contrary, if you find indubitable proofs that your ancestor has
slept soundly in the tomb, and gone the way of all flesh, you will find
yourselves much calmer, and that an attack is made upon the train of events
which at present all run one way."

     "That is precisely the argument I was using to George," said Henry, "a
few moments since."

     "Then let us go," said George, "by all means."

     "It is so decided then," said Henry.

     "Let it be done with caution," replied Mr. Marchdale.

     "If any one can manage it, of course we can."

     "Why should it not be done secretly and at night?  Of course we lose
nothing by making a night visit to a vault into which daylight, I presume,
cannot penetrate."

     "Certainly not."

     "Then let it be at night."

     "But we shall surely require the concurrence of some of the church
authorities."

     "Nay, I do not see that," interposed Mr. Marchdale.  "It is to the 
vault
actually vested in and belonging to yourself you wish to visit, and,
therefore, you have a right to visit it in any manner or at any time that 
may
be most suitable to yourself."

     "But detection in a clandestine visit might produce unpleasant
consequences."

     "The church is old," said George, "and we could easily find means of
getting into it.  There is only one objection that I see, just now, and that
is, that we leave Flora unprotected."

     "We do, indeed," said Henry.  "I did not think of that."

     "It must be put to herself, as a matter for her own consideration," 
said
Mr. Marchdale, "if she will consider herself sufficiently safe with the
company and protection of your mother only."

     "It would be a pity were we not all three present at the examination of
the coffin," remarked Henry.

     "It would, indeed.  There is ample evidence," said Mr. Marchdale, "but 
we
must not give Flora a night of sleeplessness and uneasiness on that account,
and the more particularly as we cannot well explain to her where we are 
going,
or upon what errand."

     "Certainly not."

     "Let us talk to her, then, about it," said Henry.  "I confess I am much
bent upon the plan, and fain would not forego it; neither should I like 
other
than that we three should go together."

     "If you determine, then, upon it," said Marchdale, "we will go to-
night;
and, from your acquaintance with the place, doubtless you will be able to
decide what tools are necessary."

     "There is a trap-door at the bottom of the pew," said Henry; "it is not
only secured down, but it is locked likewise, and I have the key in my
possession."

     "Indeed!"

     "Yes; immediately beneath is a short flight of stone steps, which 
conduct
at once into the vault."

     "Is it large?"

     "No; about the size of a moderate chamber, with no intricacies about 
it."

     "There can be no difficulties, then."

     "None whatever, unless we meet with actual personal interruption, which 
I
am inclined to think is very far from likely.  All we shall require will be 
a
screwdriver, with which to remove the screws, and then something with which 
to
wrench open the coffin."

     "Those we can easily provide, along with lights," remarked Mr. 
Marchdale. 
"I hope to heaven that this visit to the tomb will have the effect of easing
your minds, and enable you to make a successful stand against the streaming
torrent of evidence that has poured in upon us regarding this most fearful 
of
apparitions."

     "I do, indeed, hope so," added Henry; "and now I will go at once to
Flora, and endeavour to convince her she is safe without us to-night."

     "By-the-bye, I think," said Marchdale, "that if we can induce Mr.
Chillingworth to come with us, it will be a great point gained in the
investigation."

     "He would," said Henry, "be able to come to an accurate decision with
respect to the remains -- if any -- in the coffin, which we could not."

     "Then have him, by all means," said George.  "He did not seem averse 
last
night to go on such an adventure."

     "I will ask him when he makes his visit this morning upon Flora; and
should he not feel disposed to join us, I am quite sure he will keep the
secret of our visit."

     All this being arranged, Henry proceeded to Flora, and told her that he
and George, and Mr. Marchdale wished to go out for about a couple of hours 
in
the evening after dark, if she felt sufficiently well to feel a sense of
security without them.

     Flora changed colour, and slightly trembled, and then, as if ashamed of
her fears, she said, -- 

     "Go, go; I will not detain you.  Surely no harm can come to me in
presence of my mother."

     "We shall not be gone longer than the time I mentioned to you," said
Henry.

     "Oh, I shall be quite content.  Besides, am I to be kept thus in fear 
all
my life?  Surely, surely not. I ought, too, to learn to defend myself."

     Henry caught at the idea, as he said, --

     "If fire-arms were left you, do you think you would have courage to use
them?"

     "I do, Henry."

     "Then you shall have them; and let me beg of you to shoot any one 
without
the least hesitation who shall come into your chamber."

     "I will, Henry.  If ever human being was justified in the use of deadly
weapons, I am now.  Heaven protect me from a repetition of the visit to 
which
I have now been once subjected.  Rather, oh, much rather would I die a 
hundred
deaths than suffer what I have suffered."

     "Do not allow it, dear Flora, to press too heavily upon your mind in
dwelling upon it in conversation.  I still entertain a sanguine expectation
that something may arise to afford a far less dreadful explanation of what 
has
occurred than what you have put upon it.  Be of good cheer, Flora, we shall 
go
one hour after sunset, and return in about two hours from the time at which 
we
leave here, you may be assured."

     Notwithstanding this ready and courageous acquiescence of Flora in the
arrangement, Henry was not without his apprehension that when the night 
should
come again, her fears would return with it; but he spoke to Mr. 
Chillingworth
upon the subject, and got that gentleman's ready consent to accompany them.

     He promised to meet them at the church porch exactly at nine o'clock, 
and
matters were all arranged, and Henry waited with much eagerness and anxiety
now for the coming night, which he hoped would dissipate one of the fearful
deductions which his imagination had drawn from recent circumstances.

     He gave to Flora a pair of pistols of his own, upon which he knew he
could depend, and he took good care to load them well, so that there could 
be
no likelihood whatever of their missing fire at a critical moment.

     "Now, Flora," he said, "I have seen you use fire-arms when you were 
much
younger than you are now, and therefore I need give you no instructions.  If
any intruder does come, and you do fire, be sure you take a good aim, and
shoot low."

     "I will, Henry, I will; and you will be back in two hours?"

     "Most assuredly I will."

     The day wore on, evening came, and then deepened into night.  It turned
out to be a cloudy night, and therefore the moon's brilliance was nothing 
near
equal to what it had been on the preceding night.  Still, however, it had
sufficient power over the vapours that frequently covered it for many 
minutes
together, to produce a considerable light effect upon the face of nature, 
and
the night was consequently very far, indeed, from what might be called a 
dark
one.

     George, Henry, and Marchdale, met in one of the lower rooms of the 
house,
previous to starting upon their expedition; and after satisfying themselves
that they had with them all the tools that were necessary, inclusive of the
same small, but well-tempered iron crow-bar with which Marchdale had, on the
night of the visit of the vampyre, forced open the door of Flora's chamber,
they left the hall, and proceeded at a rapid pace towards the church.

     "And Flora does not seem much alarmed," said Marchdale, "at being left
alone?"

     "No," replied Henry, "she has made up her mind with a strong natural
courage which I knew was in her disposition to resist as much as possible 
the
depressing effect of the awful visitation she has endured."

     "It would have driven some really mad."

     "It would, indeed; and her own reason tottered on its throne, but, 
thank
Heaven, she has recovered."

     "And I fervently hope that, through her life," added Marchdale, "she 
may
never have such another trial."

     "We will not for a moment believe that such a thing can occur twice."

     "She is one among a thousand.  Most young girls would never at all have
recovered the fearful shock to the nerves."

     "Not only has she recovered," said Henry, "but a spirit, which I am
rejoiced to see, because it is one which will uphold her, of resistance now
possesses her."

     "Yes, she actually -- I forgot to tell you before -- but she actually
asked me for arms to resist any second visitation."

     "You much surprise me."

     "Yes, I was surprised, as well as pleased, myself."

     "I would have left her one of my pistols had I been aware of her having
made such a request.  Do you know if she can use fire-arms?"

     "Oh, yes; well."

     "What a pity.  I have both of them with me."

     "Oh, she is provided."

     "Provided?"

     "Yes; I found some pistols which I used to take with me on the 
continent,
and she has them both well loaded, so that if the vampyre makes his
appearance, he is likely to meet with rather a warm reception."

     "Good God! was it not dangerous?"

     "Not at all, I think."

     "Well, you know best, certainly, of course.  I hope the vampyre may 
come,
and that we may have the pleasure, when we return, of finding him dead. 
By-the-bye, I-- I--.  Bless me, I have forgot to get the materials for 
lights,
which I pledged myself to do."

     "How unfortunate."

     "Walk on slowly, while I run back and get them."

     "Oh, we are too far --"

     "Hilloa!" cried a man at this moment, some distance in front of them.

     "It is Mr. Chillingworth," said Henry.

     "Hilloa," cried the worthy doctor again.  "Is that you, my friend, 
Henry
Bannerworth?"

     "It is," cried Henry.

     Mr. Chillingworth now came up to them, and said, -- 

     "I was before my time, so rather than wait at the church porch, which
would have exposed me to observation perhaps, I thought it better to walk 
on,
and chance meeting with you."

     "You guessed we should come this way?"

     "Yes, and so it turns out, really.  It is unquestionably your most 
direct
route to the church."

     "I think I will go back," said Mr. Marchdale.

     "Back!" exclaimed the doctor; "what for?"

     "I forgot the means of getting lights.  We have candles, but no means 
of
lighting them."

     "Make yourselves easy on that score," said Mr. Chillingworth.  "I am
never without some chemical matches of my own manufacture, so that as you 
have
the candles, that can be no bar to our going on at once."

     "That is fortunate," said Henry.

     "Very," added Marchdale; "for it seems a mile's hard walking for me, or
at least half a mile from the hall.  Let us now push on."

     They did push on, all four walking at a brisk pace.  The church, 
although
it belonged to the village, was not in it.  On the contrary, it was situated
at the end of a long lane, which was a mile nearly from the village, in the
direction of the hall; therefore, in going to it from the hall, that amount 
of
distance was saved, although it was always called and considered the village
church.

     It stood alone, with the exception of a glebe house and two cottages,
that were occupied by persons who held situations about the sacred edifice,
and who were supposed, being on the spot, to keep watch and ward over it.

     It was an ancient building of the early English style of architecture, 
or
rather Norman, with one of those antique, square, short towers, built of 
flint
stones firmly embedded in cement, which, from time, had acquired almost the
consistency of stone itself.  There were numerous arched windows, partaking
something of the more florid gothic style, although scarcely ornamental 
enough
to be called such.  The edifice stood in the centre of a grave-yard, which
extended over a space of about half an acre, and altogether it was one of 
the
prettiest and most rural old churches within many miles of the spot.

     Many a lover of the antique and of the picturesque, for it was both, 
went
out of his way while travelling in the neighbourhood to look at it, and it 
had
an extensive and well-deserved reputation as a fine specimen of its class 
and
style of building.

     In Kent, to the present day, are some fine specimens of the old Roman
style of church building; and, although they are as rapidly pulled down as
the abuse of modern architects, and the cupidity of speculators, and the
vanity of clergymen can possibly encourage, in order to erect flimsy,
Italianised structures in their stead, yet sufficient of them remain dotted
over England to interest the traveller.  At Willesden there is a church of
this description, which will well repay a visit.  This, then, was the kind 
of
building into which it was the intention of our four friends to penetrate, 
not
on an unholy, or an unjustifiable errand, but on one which, proceeding from
good and proper motives, it was highly desirable to conduct in as secret a
manner as possible.

     The moon was more densely covered by clouds than it had yet been that
evening, when they reached the little wicket-gate which led into the
churchyard, through which was a regularly used thoroughfare.

     "We have a favourable night," remarked Henry, "for we are not so likely
to be disturbed."

     "And now, the question is, how are we to get in?" said Mr. 
Chillingworth,
as he paused, and glanced up at the ancient building.

     "The doors," said George, "would effectually resist us."

     "How can it be done, then?"

     "The only way I can think of," said Henry, "is to get out one of the
small, diamond-shaped panes of glass from one of the low windows, and then 
we
can one of us put in our hands, and undo the fastening, which is very 
simple,
when the window opens like a door, and it is but a step into the church."

     "A good way," said Marchdale.  "We will lose no time."

     They walked round the church till they came to a very low window 
indeed,
near to an angle of the wall, where a huge abutment struck far out into the
burial-ground.

     "Will you do it, Henry?" said George.

     "Yes.  I have often noticed the fastenings.  Just give me a slight 
hoist
up, and all will be right."

     George did so, and Henry with his knife easily bent back some of the
leadwork which held in one of the panes of glass, and then got it out whole. 
He handed it down to George, saying, -- 

     "Take this, George.  We can easily replace it when we leave, so that
there can be no signs left of any one having been here at all."

     George took the piece of thick, dim-coloured glass, and in another 
moment
Henry had succeeded in opening the window, and the mode of ingress to the 
old
church was fair and easy before them all, had there been ever so many.

     "I wonder," said Marchdale, "that a place so inefficiently protected 
has
never been robbed."

     "No wonder at all," remarked Mr. Chillingworth.  "There is nothing to
take that I am aware of that would repay anybody the trouble of taking."

     "Indeed!"

     "Not an article.  The pulpit, to be sure, is covered with faded velvet;
but beyond that, and an old box, in which I believe nothing is left but some
books, I think there is no temptation."

     "And that, Heaven knows, is little enough, then."

     "Come on," said Henry.  "Be careful; there is nothing beneath the 
window,
and the depth is about two feet."

     Thus guided, they all got fairly into the sacred edifice, and then 
Henry
closed the window, and fastened it on the inside, as he said, -- 

     "We have nothing to do now but to set to work opening a way into the
vault, and I trust that Heaven will pardon me for thus desecrating the tomb 
of
my ancestors, from a consideration of the object I have in view by so 
doing."

     "It does seem wrong thus to tamper with the secrets of the tomb,"
remarked Mr. Marchdale.

     "The secrets of a fiddlestick!" said the doctor.  "What secrets has the
tomb, I wonder?"

     "Well, but, my dear sir -- "

     "Nay, my dear sir, it is high time that death, which is, then, the
inevitable fate of us all, should be regarded with more philosophic eyes 
than
it is.  There are no secrets in the tomb but such as may well be endeavoured
to be kept secret."

     "What do you mean?"

     "There is one which very probably we shall find unpleasantly revealed."

     "Which is that?"

     "The not over pleasant odour of decomposed animal remains-- beyond that 
I
know of nothing of a secret nature that the tomb can show us."

     "Ah, your profession hardens you to such matters."

     "And a very good thing that it does, or else, if all men were to look
upon a dead body as something almost too dreadful to look upon, and by far 
too
horrible to touch, surgery would lose its value, and crime, in many 
instances
of the most obnoxious character, would go unpunished."

     "If we have a light here," said Henry, "we shall run the greatest 
chance
in the world of being seen, for the church has many windows."

     "Do not have one, then, by any means," said Mr. Chillingworth.  "A 
match
held low down in the pew may enable us to open the vault."

     "That will be the only plan."

     Henry led them to the pew which belonged to his family, and in the 
floor
of which was the trap door.

     "When was it last opened?" inquired Marchdale.

     "When my father died," said Henry; "some ten months ago now, I should
think."

     "The screws, then, have had ample time to fix themselves with fresh
rust."

     "Here is one of my chemical matches," said Mr. Chillingworth, as he
suddenly irradiated the pew with a clear and beautiful flame, that lasted
about a minute.

     The heads of the screws were easily discernible, and the short time 
that
the light lasted had enabled Henry to turn the key he had brought with him 
in
the lock.

     "I think that without a light now," he said, "I can turn the screws
well."

     "Can you?"

     "Yes, there are but four."

     "Try it, then."

     Henry did so, and from the screws having very large heads, and being 
made
purposely, for the convenience of removal when required, with deep
indentations to receive the screw-driver, he found no difficulty in feeling
for the proper places, and extracting the screws without any more light than
was afforded to him from the general whitish aspect of the heavens.

     "Now, Mr. Chillingworth," he said, "another of your matches, if you
please.  I have all the screws so loose that I can pick them up with my
fingers."

     "Here," said the doctor.

     In another moment the pew was as light as day, and Henry succeeded in
taking out the few screws, which he placed in his pocket for their greater
security, since, of course, the intention was to replace everything exactly 
as
it was found, in order that not the least surmise should arise in the mind 
of
any person that the vault had been opened, and visited for any purpose
whatever, secretly or otherwise.

     "Let us descend," said Henry.  "There is no further obstacle, my 
friends. 
Let us descend."

     "If any one," remarked George, in a whisper, as they slowly descended 
the
stairs which conducted into the vault -- "if any one had told me that I 
should
be descending into a vault for the purpose of ascertaining if a dead body,
which had been nearly a century there, was removed or not, and had become a
vampyre, I should have denounced the idea as one of the most absurd that 
ever
entered the brain of a human being."

     "We are the very slaves of circumstances," said Marchdale, "and we 
never
know what we may do, or what we may not.  What appears to us so improbable 
as
to border even upon the impossible at one time, is at another the only 
course
of action which appears feasibly open to us to attempt to pursue."

     They had now reached the vault, the floor of which was composed of flat
red tiles, laid in tolerable order the one beside the other.  As Henry had
stated, the vault was by no means of large extent.  Indeed, several of the
apartments for the living, at the hall, were much larger than was that one
destined for the dead.

     The atmosphere was damp and noisome, but not by any means so bad as 
might
have been expected, considering the number of months which had elapsed since
last the vault was opened to receive one of its ghastly and still visitants.

     "Now for one of your lights, Mr. Chillingworth.  You say you have the
candle, I think, Marchdale, although you forgot the matches."

     "I have.  Here they are."

     Marchdale took from his pocket a parcel which contained several wax
candles, and when it was opened, a smaller packet fell to the ground.

     "Why, these are instantaneous matches," said Mr. Chillingworth, as he
lifted the small packet up.

     "They are; and what a fruitless journey I should have had back to the
hall," said Mr. Marchdale, "if you had not been so well provided as you are
with the means of getting a light.  These matches, which I thought I had not
with me, have been, in the hurry of our departure, enclosed, you see, with 
the
candles.  Truly, I should have hunted for them at home in vain."

     Mr. Chillingworth lit the wax candle which was now handed to him by
Marchdale, and in another moment the vault from one end of it to the other 
was
quite discernible.

 Next Time: The Coffin. -- The Absence of the Dead. -- The Mysterious
 Circumstance, and the Consternation of George.




                               CHAPTER VIII.

THE COFFIN. -- THE ABSENCE OF THE DEAD. -- THE MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE, AND
THE CONSTERNATION OF GEORGE.


     They were all silent for a few moments as they looked around them with
natural feelings of curiosity.  Two of that party had of course never been 
in
that vault at all, and the brothers, although they had descended into it 
upon
the occasion, nearly a year before, of their father being placed in it, 
still
looked upon it with almost as curious eyes as they who now had their first
sight of it.

     If a man be at all of a thoughtful or imaginative cast of mind, some
curious sensations are sure to come over him, upon standing in such a place,
where he knows around him lie, in the calmness of death, those in whose 
veins
have flowed kindred blood to him -- who bore the same name, and who preceded
him in the brief drama of his existence, influencing his destiny and his
position in life probably largely by their actions compounded of their 
virtues
and their vices.

     Henry Bannerworth and his brother George were just the kind of persons 
to
feel strongly such sensations.  Both were reflective, imaginative, educated
young men, and, as the light from the wax candle flashed upon their faces, 
it
was evident how deeply they felt the situation in which they were placed.

     Mr. Chillingworth and Marchdale were silent.  They both knew what was
passing in the minds of the brothers, and they had too much delicacy to
interrupt a train of thought which, although from having no affinity with 
the
dead who lay around, they could not share in, yet they respected.  Henry at
length, with a sudden start, seemed to recover himself from his reverie.

     "This is a time for action, George," he said, "and not for romantic
thought.  Let us proceed."

     "Yes, yes," said George, and he advanced a step towards the centre of 
the
vault.

     "Can you find out among all these coffins, for there seem to be nearly
twenty," said Mr. Chillingworth, "which is the one we seek?"

     "I think we may," replied Henry.  "Some of the earlier coffins of our
race, I know, were made of marble, and others of metal, both of which
materials, I expect, would withstand the encroaches of time for a hundred
years, at least."

     "Let us examine," said George.

     There were shelves or niches built into the walls all round, on which 
the
coffins were placed, so that there could not be much difficulty in a minute
examination of them all, the one after the other.

     When, however, they came to look, they found that "decay's offensive
fingers" had been more busy than they could have imagined, and that whatever
they touched of the earlier coffins crumbled into dust before their very
fingers.

     In some cases the inscriptions were quite illegible, and, in others, 
the
plates that had borne them had fallen on to the floor of the vault, so that 
it
was impossible to say to which coffin they belonged.

     Of course, the more recent and fresh-looking coffins they did not
examine, because they could not have anything to do with the object of that
melancholy visit.

     "We shall arrive at no conclusion," said George.  "All seems to have
rotted away among those coffins where we might expect to find the one
belonging to Marmaduke Bannerworth, our ancestor."

     "Here is a coffin plate," said Marchdale, taking one from the floor.

     He handed it to Mr. Chillingworth, who, upon an inspection of it, close
to the light, exclaimed, -- 

     "It must have belonged to the coffin you seek."

     "What says it?"

                              "Ye mortale remains of
                           Marmaduke Bannerworth, Yeoman.
                                God reste his soule.
                                    A.D. 1640."    

     "It is the plate belonging to his coffin," said Henry, "and now our
search is fruitless."

     "It is so, indeed," exclaimed George, "for how can we tell to which of
the coffins that have lost the plates this one really belongs?"

     "I should not be so hopeless," said Marchdale.  "I have, from time to
time, in the pursuit of antiquarian lore, which I was once fond of, entered
many vaults, and I have always observed that an inner coffin of metal was
sound and good, while the outer one of wood had rotted away, and yielded at
once to the touch of the first hand that was laid upon it."

     "But, admitting that to be the case," said Henry, "how does that assist
us in the identification of the coffin?"

     "I have always, in my experience, found the name and rank of the 
deceased
engraved upon the lid of the inner coffin, as well as being set forth in a
much more perishable manner on the plate which was once secured to the outer
one."

     "He is right," said Mr. Chillingworth.  "I wonder we never thought of
that.  If your ancestor was buried in a leaden coffin, there will be no
difficulty in finding which it is."

     Henry seized the light, and proceeding to one of the coffins, which
seemed to be a mass of decay, he pulled away some of the rotted wood work,
and then suddenly exclaimed, -- 

     "You are quite right.  Here is a firm strong leaden coffin within, 
which,
although quite black, does not appear otherwise to have suffered."

     "What is the inscription on that?" said George.

     With difficulty the name on the lid was deciphered, but it was found 
not
to be the coffin of him whom they sought.

     "We can make short work of this," said Marchdale, "by only examining
those leaden coffins which have lost the plates from off their outer cases. 
There do not appear to be many in such a state."

     He then, with another light, which he lighted from the one that Henry 
now
carried, commenced actively assisting in the search, which was carried on
silently for more than ten minutes.

     Suddenly Mr. Marchdale cried, in a tone of excitement, --

     "I have found it.  It is here."

     They all immediately surrounded the spot where he was, and then he
pointed to the lid of a coffin, which he had been rubbing with his
handkerchief, in order to make the inscription more legible, and said, -- 

     "See.  It is here."

     By the combined light of the candles they saw the words, --
 
     "Marmaduke Bannerworth, Yeoman.  1640."

     "Yes, there can be no mistake here," said Henry.  "This is the coffin,
and it shall be opened."

     "I have the iron crowbar here," said Marchdale.  "It is an old friend 
of
mine, and I am accustomed to the use of it.  Shall I open the coffin?"

     "Do so -- do so," said Henry.

     They stood around in silence, while Mr. Marchdale, with much care,
proceeded to open the coffin, which seemed of great thickness, and was of
solid lead.

     It was probably the partial rotting of the metal, in consequence of the
damps of that place, what made it easier to open the coffin than it 
otherwise
would have been, but certain it was that the top came away remarkably 
easily. 
Indeed, so easily did it come off, that another supposition might have been 
hazarded, namely, that it had never been effectively fastened.

     The few moments that elapsed were ones of very great suspense to every
one there present; and it would, indeed, be quite safe to assert, that all 
the
world was for the time forgotten in the absorbing interest which appertained
to the affair which was in progress.

     The candles were now both held by Mr. Chillingworth, and they were so
held as to cast a full and clear light upon the coffin.  Now the lid slid 
off,
and Henry eagerly gazed into the interior.

     There lay something certainly there, and an audible "Thank God!" 
escaped
his lips.

     "The body is there!" exclaimed George.

     "All right," said Marchdale, "here it is.  There is something, and what
else can it be?"

     "Hold the lights," said Mr. Chillingworth; "hold the lights, some of 
you;
let us be quite certain."

     George took the lights, and Mr. Chillingworth, without any hesitation,
dipped his hands at once into the coffin, and took up some fragments of rags
which were there.  They were so rotten, that they fell to pieces in his 
grasp,
like so many pieces of tinder.

     There was a death-like pause for some few moments, and then Mr.
Chillingworth said, in a low voice, --

     "There is not the least vestige of a dead body here."

     Henry gave a deep groan, as he said, -- 

     "Mr. Chillingworth, can you take upon yourself to say that no corpse 
has
undergone the process of decomposition in this coffin?"

     "To answer your question exactly, as probably in your hurry you have
worded it," said Mr. Chillingworth, "I cannot take upon myself to say any 
such
thing; but this I can say, namely, that in this coffin there are no animal
remains, and that it is quite impossible that any corpse enclosed here 
could,
in any lapse of time, have so utterly and entirely disappeared."

     "I am answered," said Henry.

     "Good God!" exclaimed George, "and has this but added another damning
proof, to those we have already on our minds, of one of the most dreadful
superstitions that ever the mind of man conceived?"

     "It would seem so," said Marchdale sadly.

     "Oh, that I were dead!  This is terrible.  God of heaven, why are these
things?  Oh, if I were but dead, and so spared the torture of supposing such
things possible."

     "Think again, Mr. Chillingworth; I pray you think again," cried
Marchdale.

     "If I were to think for the remainder of my existence," he replied, "I
could come to no other conclusion.  It is not a matter of opinion; it is a
matter of fact."

     "You are positive, then," said Henry, "that the dead body of Marmaduke
Bannerworth has not rested here?"

     "I am positive.  Look for yourselves.  The lead is but slightly
discoloured; it looks tolerably clean and fresh; there is not a vestige of
putrefaction -- no bones, no dust even."

     They did all look for themselves, and the most casual glance was
sufficient to satisfy the most sceptical.

     "All is over," said Henry; "let us now leave this place; and all I can
now ask of you, my friends, is to lock this dreadful secret deep in your own
hearts."

     "It shall never pass my lips," said Marchdale.

     "Nor mine, you may depend," said the doctor.  "I was much in hopes that
this night's work would have had the effect of dissipating, instead of 
adding
to, the gloomy fancies that now possess you."

     "Good heavens!" cried George, "can you call them fancies, Mr.
Chillingworth?"

     "I do, indeed."

     "Have you yet a doubt?"

     "My young friend, I told you from the first, that I would not believe 
in
your vampyre; and I tell you now, that if one was to come and lay hold of me
by the throat, as long as I could at all gasp for breath I would tell him he
was a d----d impostor."

     "This is carrying incredulity to the verge of obstinacy."

     "Far beyond it, if you please."

     "You will not be convinced?" said Marchdale.

     "I most decidedly, on this point, will not."

     "Then you are one who would doubt a miracle, if you saw it with your 
own
eyes."

     "I would, because I do not believe in miracles.  I should endeavour to
find some rational and some scientific means of accounting for the 
phenomenon,
and that's the very reason why we have no miracles now-a-days, between you 
and
I, and no prophets and saints, and all that sort of thing."

     "I would rather avoid such observations in such a place as this," said
Marchdale.

     "Nay, do not be the moral coward," cried Mr. Chillingworth, "to make 
your
opinions, or the expression of them, dependent upon any certain locality."

     "I know not what to think," said Henry; "I am bewildered quite.  Let us
now come away."

     Mr. Marchdale replaced the lid of the coffin, and then the little party
moved towards the staircase.  Henry turned before he ascended, and glanced
back into the vault.

     "Oh," he said, "if I could but think there had been some mistake, some
error of judgment, on which the mind could rest for hope."

     "I deeply regret," said Marchdale, "that I so strenuously advised this
expedition.  I did hope that from it would have resulted much good."

     "And you have every reason so to hope," said Chillingworth.  "I advised
it likewise, and I tell you that its result perfectly astonishes me, 
although
I will not allow myself to embrace at once all the conclusions to which it
would seem to lead me."

     "I am satisfied," said Henry; "I know you both advised me for the best. 
The curse of Heaven seems now to have fallen upon me and my house."

     "Oh, nonsense!" said Chillingworth.  "What for?"

     "Alas!  I know not."

     "Then you may depend that Heaven would never act so oddly.  In the 
first
place, Heaven don't curse anybody; and, in the second, it is too just to
inflict pain where pain is not amply deserved."

     They ascended the gloomy staircase of the vault.  The countenances of
both George and Henry were very much saddened, and it was quite evident that
their thoughts were by far too busy to enable them to enter into any
conversation.  They did not, and particularly George, seem to hear all that
was said to them.  Their intellects seemed almost stunned by the unexpected
circumstance of the disappearance of the body of their ancestor.

     All along they had, although almost unknown to themselves, felt a sort 
of
conviction that hey must find some remains of Marmaduke Bannerworth, which
would render the supposition, even in the most superstition minds, that he 
was
the vampyre, a thing totally and physically impossible.

     But now the whole question assumed a far more bewildering shape.  The
body was not in its coffin -- it had not there quietly slept the long sleep 
of
death common to humanity.  Where was it then?  What had become of it?  
Where,
how, and under what circumstances had it been removed?  Had it itself burst
the bands that held it, and hideously stalked forth into the world again to
make one of its seeming inhabitants, and kept up for a hundred years a
dreadful existence by such adventures as it had consummated at the hall, 
where, in the course of ordinary human life, it had once lived?

     All these were questions which irresistibly pressed themselves upon the
consideration of Henry and his brother.  They were awful questions.

     And yet, take any sober, sane, thinking, educated man, and show him all
that they had seen, subject him to all which they had been subjected, and 
say
if human reason, and all the arguments that the subtlest brain could back it
with, would be able to hold out against such a vast accumulation of horrible
evidences, and say, -- "I don't believe it."

     Mr. Chillingworth's was the only plan.  He would not argue the 
question. 
He said at once, --

     "I will not believe this thing -- upon this point I will yield to no
evidence whatever."

     That was the only way of disposing of such a question; but there are 
not
many who could so dispose of it, and not one so much interested in it as 
were
the brothers Bannerworth, who could at all hope to get into such a state of
mind.

     The boards were laid carefully down again, and the screws replaced. 
Henry found himself unequal to the task, so it was done by Marchdale, who 
took
pains to replace everything in the same state in which they had found it, 
even
to laying the matting at the bottom of the pew.

     Then they extinguished the light, and, with heavy hearts, they all 
walked
towards the window, to leave the sacred edifice by the same means they had
entered it.

     "Shall we replace the pane of glass?" said Marchdale.

     "Oh, it matters not-- it matters not," said Henry, listlessly; "nothing
matters now.  I care not what becomes of me-- am getting weary of a life
which now must be one of misery and dread."

     "You must not allow yourself to fall into such a state of mind as 
this,"
said the doctor, "or you will become a patient of mine very quickly."

     "I cannot help it."

     "Well, but be a man.  If there are serious evils affecting you, fight 
out
against them the best way you can."

     "I cannot."

     "Come, now, listen to me.  We need not, I think, trouble ourselves 
about
the pane of glass, so come along."

     He took the arm of Henry and walked on with him a little in advance of
the others.

     "Henry," he said, "the best way, you may depend, of meeting evils, be
they great or small, is to get up an obstinate feeling of defiance against
them.  Now, when anything occurs which is uncomfortable to me, I endeavour 
to
convince myself, and I have no great difficulty in doing so, that I am a
decidedly injured man."

     "Indeed!"

     "Yes; I get very angry, and that gets up a kind of obstinacy, which 
makes
me not feel half so much mental misery as would be my portion if I were to
succumb to the evil, and commence whining over it, as many people do, under
the pretence of being resigned."

     "But this family affliction of mine transcends anything that anybody 
else
ever endured."

     "I don't know that; but it is a view of the subject which, if I were 
you,
would only make me more obstinate."

     "What can I do?"

     "In the first place, I would say to myself, 'There may or there may not
be supernatural beings, who, from some physical derangement of the ordinary
nature of things, make themselves obnoxious to living people; if there are,
d--n them!  There may be vampyres; and if there are, I defy them.'  Let the
imagination paint its very worst terrors; let fear do what it will and what
it can in peopling the mind with horrors.  Shrink from nothing, and even 
then
I would defy them all."

     "Is not that like defying Heaven?"

     "Most certainly not; for in all we say and in all we do we act from the
impulses of that mind which is given to us by Heaven itself.  If Heaven
creates an intellect and a mind of a certain order, Heaven will not quarrel
that it does the work which it was adapted to do."

     "I know these are your opinions.  I have heard you mention them 
before."

     "They are the opinions of every rational person, Henry Bannerworth,
because they will stand the test of reason; and what I urge upon you is, not
to allow yourself to be mentally prostrated, even if a vampyre had paid a
visit to your house.  Defy him, say I-- fight him.  Self-preservation is a
great law of nature, implanted in all our hearts; do you summon it to your
aid."

     "I will endeavour to think as you would have me.  I though more than 
once
of summoning religion to my aid."

     "Well, that is religion."

     "Indeed!"

     "I consider so, and the most rational religion of all.  All that we 
read
about religion that does not seem expressly to agree with it, you may 
consider
as an allegory."

     "But, Mr. Chillingworth, I cannot and will not renounce the sublime
truths of Scripture.  They may be incomprehensible; they may be 
inconsistent;
and some of them may look ridiculous; but still they are sacred and sublime,
and I will not renounce them although my reason may not accord with them,
because they are the laws of Heaven."

     No wonder this powerful argument silenced Mr. Chillingworth, who was 
one
of those characters in society who hold most dreadful opinions, and who 
would
destroy religious beliefs, and all the different sects of the world, if they
could, and endeavour to introduce instead some horrible system of human 
reason
and profound philosophy.

     But how soon the religious man silences his opponent; and let it not be
supposed that, because his opponent says no more upon the subject, he does 
so
because he is disgusted with the stupidity of the other; no, it is because 
he
is completely beaten, and has nothing more to say.

     The distance now between the church and the hall was nearly traversed,
and Mr. Chillingworth, who was a very good man, not withstanding his 
disbelief
in certain things of course paved the way for him to hell, took a kind leave
of Mr. Marchdale and the brothers, promising to call on the following 
morning
and see Flora.

     Henry and George then, in earnest conversation with Marchdale, 
proceeded
homewards.  It was evident that the scene in the vault had made a deep and
saddening impression on them, and one which was not likely easily to be
eradicated.

 Next Time: The Occurrences of the Night at the Hall. -- The Second 
Appearance
 of the Vampyre, and the Pistol-shot.




                                 CHAPTER IX.

THE OCCURRENCES OF THE NIGHT AT THE HALL. -- THE SECOND APPEARANCE OF THE
VAMPYRE, AND THE PISTOL-SHOT.


     Despite the full and free consent which Flora had given to her brothers
to entrust her solely to the care of her mother and her own courage at the
hall, she felt greater fear creep over her after they were gone than she
chose to acknowledge.

     A sort of presentiment appeared to come over her that some evil was
about to occur, and more than once she caught herself almost in the act of
saying, -- 

     "I wish they had not gone."

     Mrs. Bannerworth, too, could not be supposed to be entirely destitute 
of
uncomfortable feelings, when she came to consider how poor a guard she was
over her beautiful child, and how much terror might even deprive of the
little power she had, should the dreadful visiter again make his appearance.

     "But it is but for two hours," thought Flora, "and two hours will soon
pass away."

     There was, too, another feeling which gave her some degree of 
confidence,
although it arose from a bad source, inasmuch as it was one which showed
powerfully how much her mind was dwelling on the particulars of the horrible
belief in the class of supernatural beings, one of whom she believed had
visited her.

     That consideration was this.  The two hours of absence from the hall of
its male inhabitants, would be from nine o'clock until eleven, and those 
were
not the two hours during which she felt that she would be most timid on
account of the vampyre.

     "It was after midnight before," she thought, "when it came, and perhaps
it may not be able to come earlier.  It may not have the power, until that
time, to make its hideous visits, and, therefore, I will believe myself 
safe."

     She had made up her mind not to go to bed until the return of her
brothers, and she and her mother sat in a small room that was used as a
breakfast-room, and which had a latticed window that opened on to the lawn.

     This window had in the inside strong oaken shutters, which had been
fastened as securely as their construction would admit of some time before 
the
departure of the brothers and Mr. Marchdale on that melancholy expedition, 
the
object of which, if it had been known to her, would have added so much to 
the
terrors of poor Flora.

     It was not even guessed at, however remotely, so that she had not the
additional affliction of thinking, that while she was sitting there, a prey 
to
all sorts of imaginative terrors, they were perhaps gathering fresh 
evidence,
as, indeed, they were, of the dreadful reality of the appearance which, but
for the collateral circumstances attendant upon its coming and its going, 
she
would fain have persuaded herself was but the vision of a dream.

     It was before nine that the brothers started, but in her own mind Flora
gave them to eleven, and when she heard ten o'clock sound from a clock which
stood in the hall, she felt pleased to think that in another hour they would
surely be at home.

     "My dear," said her mother, "you look more like yourself, now."

     "Do I, mother?"

     "Yes, you are well again."

     "Ah, if I could forget --"

     "Time, dear Flora, will enable you to do so, and all the rest of what
made you so unwell will pass away.  You will soon forget it all."

     "I will hope to do so."

     "Be assured that, some day or another, something will occur, as Henry
says, to explain all that has happened, in some way consistent with reason 
and
the ordinary nature of things, my dear Flora."

     "Oh, I will cling to such a belief; I will get Henry, upon whose 
judgment
I know I can rely, to tell me so, and each time that I hear such words from
his lips, I will contrive to dismiss some portion of the terror which now, I
cannot but confess, clings to my heart."

     Flora laid her hand upon her mothers's arm, and in a low, anxious tone
of voice, said, -- "Listen, mother."

     Mrs. Bannerworth turned pale, as she said, -- "Listen to what, dear?"

     "Within these last ten minutes," said Flora, "I have thought three or
four times that I heard a slight noise without.  Nay, mother, do not tremble
-- it may be only fancy."

     Flora herself trembled, and was of a death-like paleness; once or twice
she passed her hand across her brow, and altogether she presented a picture 
of
much mental suffering.

     They now conversed in anxious whispers, and almost all they said
consisted in anxious wishes for the return of the brothers and Mr. 
Marchdale.

     "You will be happier and more assured, my dear, with some company," 
said
Mrs. Bannerworth.  "Shall I ring for the servants, and let them remain in 
the
room with us, until they who are our best safeguards next to Heaven return?"

     "Hush -- hush -- hush, mother!"

     "What do you hear?"

     "I thought -- I heard a faint sound."

     "I heard nothing, dear."

     "Listen again, mother.  Surely I could not be deceived so often.  I 
have
now, at least, six times heard a sound as if some one was outside by the
windows."

     "No, no, my darling, do not think; your imagination is active and in a
state of excitement."

     "It is, and yet --"

     "Believe me, it deceives you."

     "I hope to Heaven it does!"

     There was a pause of some minutes' duration, and then Mrs. Bannerworth
again urged slightly the calling of some of the servants, for she thought 
that
their presence might have the effect of giving a different direction to her
child's thoughts; but Flora saw her place her hand upon the bell, and she
said, --
 
     "No, mother, no -- not yet, not yet.  Perhaps I am deceived."

     Mrs. Bannerworth upon this sat down, but no sooner had she done so than
she heartily regretted she had not rung the bell, for, before another word
could be spoken, there came too perceptibly upon their ears for there to be
any mistake at all about it, a strange scratching noise upon the window
outside.

     A faint cry came from Flora's lips, as she exclaimed, in a voice of 
great
agony, --

     "Oh, God! -- oh, God!  It has come again!"

     Mrs. Bannerworth became faint, and unable to move or speak at all; she
could only sit like one paralysed, and unable to do more than listen to and
see what was going on.

     The scratching noise continued for a few seconds, and then altogether
ceased.  Perhaps, under ordinary circumstances, such a sound outside the
window would have scarcely afforded food for comment at all, or, if it had, 
it
would have been attributed to some natural effect, or to the exertions of 
some
bird or animal to obtain admittance to the house.

     But there had occurred now enough in that family to make any little 
sound
of wonderful importance, and these things which before would have passed
completely unheeded, at all events without creating much alarm, were now
invested with a fearful interest.

     When the scratching noise ceased, Flora spoke in a low, anxious 
whisper,
as she said, --

     "Mother, you heard it then?"

     Mrs. Bannerworth tried to speak, but she could not; and then suddenly,
with a loud clash, the bar, which on the inside appeared to fasten the
shutters strongly, fell as if by some invisible agency, and the shutters 
now,
but for the intervention of the window, could be easily pushed open from
without.

     Mrs. Bannerworth covered her face with her hands, and, after rocking to
and fro for a moment, she fell off her chair, having fainted with the excess
of terror that came over her.

     For about the space of time in which a fast speaker could count twelve,
Flora thought her reason was leaving her, but it did not.  She found herself
recovering; and there she sat, with her eyes fixed upon the window, looking
more like some exquisitely-chiselled statue of despair than a being of flesh
and blood, expecting each moment to have its eyes blasted by some horrible
appearance, such as might be supposed to drive her to madness.

     And now again came the strange knocking or scratching against the pane 
of
glass of the window.

     This continued for some minutes, during which it appeared likewise to
Flora that some confusion was going on at another part of the house, for she
fancied she heard voices and the banging of doors.

     It seemed to her as if she must have sat looking at the shutters of 
that
window a long time before she saw them shake, and then one wide hinged 
portion
of them slowly opened.

     Once again horror appeared to be on the point of producing madness in 
her
brain, and then, as before, a feeling of calmness rapidly ensued.

     She was able to see plainly that something was by the window, but what 
it
was she could not plainly discern, in consequence of the lights she had in 
the
room.  A few moments, however, sufficed to settle that mystery, for the 
window
was opened and a figure stood before her.

     One glance, one terrified glance, in which her whole soul was
concentrated, sufficed to shew her who and what the figure was.  There was a
tall, gaunt form -- there was the faded ancient apparel -- the lustrous
metallic-looking eyes -- its half-opened mouth, exhibiting tusk-like teeth! 
It was -- yes, it was -- _the vampyre!_

     It stood for a moment gazing at her, and then in the hideous way it had
attempted before to speak, it apparently endeavoured to utter some words 
which
it could not make articulate to human ears.  The pistols lay before Flora. 
Mechanically she raised one, and pointed it at the figure.  It advanced a
step, and then she pulled the trigger.

     A stunning report followed.  There was a loud cry of pain, and the
vampyre fled.  The smoke and confusion that was incidental to the spot
prevented her from seeing if the figure walked or ran away.  She thought he
heard a crashing sound among the plants outside the window, as if it had
fallen, but she didnot feel quite sure.

     It was no effort of any reflection, but a purely mechanical movement,
that made her raise the other pistol, and discharge that likewise in the
direction the vampyre had taken.  Then casting the weapon away, she rose, 
and
made a frantic rush from the room.  She opened the door, and was dashing 
out,
when she found herself caught in the circling arms of some one who either 
had
been there waiting, or who had just at that moment got there.

     The thought that it was the vampyre, who by some mysterious means had 
got
there, and was about to make her his prey, now overcame her completely, and
she sunk into a state of utter insensibility on the moment.

 Next Time: The Return From the Vault. -- The Alarm, and the Search Around 
the
 Hall.



          CHAPTER X.
 
THE RETURN FROM THE VAULT. -- THE ALARM, AND THE SEARCH AROUND THE HALL.
 
     It so happened that George and Henry Bannerworth, along with Mr.
Marchdale, had just reached the gate which conducted into the garden of the
mansion when they all were alarmed by the report of a pistol.  Amid the
stillness of the night, it came upon them with so sudden a shock, that they
involuntarily paused, and there came from the lips of each an expression of
alarm.
 
     "Good heavens!" cried George, "can that be Flora firing at any 
intruder?"
 
     "It must be," cried Henry; "she has in her possession the only weapons 
in
the house."
 
     Mr. Marchdale turned very pale, and trembled slightly, but he did not
speak.
 
     "On, on," cried Henry; "for God's sake, let us hasten on."
 
     As he spoke, he cleared the gate at a bound, and at a terrific pace he
made towards the house, passing over beds, and plantations, and flowers
heedlessly, so that he went the most direct way to it.
 
     Before, however, it was possible for any human speed to accomplish even
half of the distance, the report of the other shot came upon his ears, and 
he
even fancied he heard the bullet whistle past his head in tolerably close
proximity.  This supposition gave him a clue to the direction at all events
from whence the shots proceeded, otherwise he knew not from which window 
they
were fired, because it had not occurred to him, previous to leaving home, to
inquire in which room Flora and his mother were likely to be seated waiting
his return.
 
     He was right as regarded the bullet.  It was that winged messenger of
death which had passed his head in such very dangerous proximity, and
consequently he made with tolerable accuracy towards the open window from
whence the shots had been fired.
 
     The night was not near so dark as it had been, although even yet it was
very far from being a light one, and he was soon enabled to see that there 
was
a room, the window of which was wide open, and lights burning on the table
within.  He made towards it in a moment, and entered it.  To his 
astonishment,
the first objects he beheld were Flora and a stranger, who was now 
supporting
her in his arms.  To grapple him by the throat was the work of a moment, but
the stranger cried aloud in a voice which sounded familiar to Henry, --
 
     "Good God, are you all mad?"
 
     Henry relaxed his hold, and looked in his face.
 
     "Gracious heavens, it is Mr. Holland!" he said.
 
     "Yes; did you not know me?"
 
     Henry was bewildered.  He staggered to a seat, and, in doing so, he saw
his mother stretched apparently lifeless upon the floor.  To raise her was 
the
work of a moment, and then Marchdale and George, who had followed him as 
fast
as they could, appeared at the open window.
 
     Such a strange scene as that small room now exhibited had never been
equalled in Bannerworth Hall.  There was young Mr. Holland, of whom mention
has already been made, as the affianced lover of Flora, supporting her
fainting form.  There was Henry doing equal service to his mother; and on 
the
floor lay the two pistols, and one of the candles which had been upset in 
the
confusion:  while the terrified attitudes of George and Mr. Marchdale at the
window completed the strange-looking picture.
 
     "What is this -- oh! what has happened?" cried George.
 
     "I know not -- I know not," said Henry.  "Some one summon the servants; 
I
am nearly mad."
 
     Mr. Marchdale at once rung the bell, for George looked so faint and ill
as to be incapable of doing so; and he rung it so loudly and so effectually,
that the two servants who had been employed suddenly upon the others leaving
came with much speed to know what was the matter.
 
     "See to your mistress," said Henry.  "She is dead, or has fainted.  For
God's sake, let who can give me some account of what has caused all this
confusion here."
 
     "Are you aware, Henry," said Marchdale, "that a stranger is present in
the room?"
 
     He pointed at Mr. Holland as he spoke, who, before Henry could reply,
said, --
 
     "Sir, I may be a stranger to you, as you are to me, and yet no stranger
to those whose home this is."
 
     "No, no," said Henry, "you are no stranger to us, Mr. Holland, but are
thrice welcome -- none can be more welcome.  Mr. Marchdale, this is Mr.
Holland, of whom you have heard me speak."
 
     "I am proud to know you, sir," said Mr. Marchdale.
 
     "Sir, I thank you," replied Holland, coldly.
 
     It will so happen; but, at first sight, it appeared as if those two
persons had some sort of antagonistic feeling towards each other, which
threatened to prevent effectually their ever becoming intimate friends.
 
     The appeal of Henry to the servants to know if they could tell him what
had occurred was answered in the negative.  All they knew was, that they had
heard two shots fired, and that, since then, they had remained where they
were, in a great fright, until the bell was rung violently.  This was no 
news
at all, and, therefore, the only chance was, to wait patiently for the
recovery of the mother, or of Flora, from one or the other of whom surely 
some
information could be at once then procured.
 
     Mrs. Bannerworth was removed to her own room, and so would Flora have
been; but Mr. Holland, who was supporting her in his arms, said, --
 
     "I think the air from the open window is recovering her, and it is 
likely
to do so.  Oh, do not now take her from me, after so long an absence.  
Flora,
Flora, look up; do you not know me?  You have not yet given me one look of
acknowledgement.  Flora, dear Flora!"
 
     The sound of his voice seemed to act as the most potent of charms in
restoring her to consciousness; it broke through the death-like trance in
which she lay, and, opening her beautiful eyes, she fixed them upon his 
face,
saying, --
 
     "Yes, yes; it is Charles -- it is Charles."
 
     She burst into a hysterical flood of tears, and clung to him like some
terrified child to its only friend in the whole wide world.
 
     "Oh, my dear friends," cried Charles Holland, "do not deceive me; has
Flora been ill?"
 
     "We have all been ill," said George.
 
     "All ill?"
 
     "Ay, and nearly mad," exclaimed Harry.
 
     Holland looked from one to the other in surprise, as well he might, nor
was that surprise at all lessened when Flora made an effort to extricate
herself from his embrace, as she exclaimed, --
 
     "You must leave me -- you must leave me, Charles, for ever! Oh! never,
never look upon my face again!"
 
     "I -- I am bewildered," said Charles.
 
     "Leave me, now," continued Flora; "think me unworthy; think what you
will, Charles, but I cannot, I dare not, now be yours."
 
     "Is this a dream?"
 
     "Oh, would it were.  Charles, if we had never met, you would be happier
-- I could not be more wretched."
 
     "Flora, Flora, do you say these words of so great cruelty to try my
love?"
 
     "No, as Heaven is my judge, I do not."
 
     "Gracious Heaven, then, what do they mean?"
 
     Flora shuddered, and Henry, coming up to her, took her hand in his
tenderly, as he said, --
 
     "Has it been again?"
 
     "It has."
 
     "You shot it?"
 
     "I fired full upon it, Henry, but it fled."
 
     "It did -- fly?"
 
     "It did, Henry, but it will come again -- it will surely come again."
 
     "You -- you hit it with the bullet?" interposed Mr. Marchdale.  
"Perhaps
you killed it?"
 
     "I think I must have hit it, unless I am mad."
 
     Charles Holland looked from one to the other with such a look of 
intense
surprise, that George remarked it, and said at once to him, --
 
     "Mr. Holland, a full explanation is due to you, and you shall have it."
 
     "You seem to be the only rational person here," said Charles.  "Pray 
what
is it that everybody calls '_it?'_"
 
     "Hush -- hush!" said Henry; "you will soon hear, but not at present."
 
     "Hear me, Charles," said Flora.  "From this moment, mind, I do release
you from every vow, from every promise made to me of constancy and love; and
if you are wise, Charles, and will be advised, you will now this moment 
leave
this house never to return to it."
 
     "No," said Charles -- "no; by Heaven I love you, Flora!  I have come to
say again all that in another clime I said with joy to you.  When I forget
you, let what trouble may oppress you, may God forget me, and my own right
hand forget to do me honest service."
 
     "Oh! no more -- no more!" sobbed Flora.
 
     "Yes, much more, if you will tell me of words which will be stronger 
than
others in which to paint my love, my faith, and my constancy."
 
     "Be prudent," said Henry.  "Say no more."
 
     "Nay, upon such a theme I could speak for ever.  You may cast me off,
Flora; but until you tell me you love another, I am yours till the death, 
and
then with a sanguine hope at my heart that we shall meet again, never,
dearest, to part."
 
     Flora sobbed bitterly.
 
     "Oh!" she said, "this is the unkindest blow of all -- this is worse 
than
all."
 
     "Unkind!" echoed Holland.
 
     "Heed her not," said Henry; "she means not you."
 
     "Oh, no -- no!" she cried.  "Farewell, Charles -- dear Charles."
 
     "Oh, say that word again!" he exclaimed, with animation. "It is the 
first
time such music has met my ears."
 
     "It must be the last."
 
     "No, no -- oh, no."
 
     "For your own sake I shall be able now, Charles, to show you that I
really loved you."
 
     "Not by casting me from you?"
 
     "Yes, even so.  That will be the way to show that I love you."
 
     She held up her hands wildly, as she added, in an excited voice, --
 
     "The curse of destiny is upon me!  I am singled out as one lost and
accursed.  Oh, horror -- horror! would that I were dead!"
 
     Charles staggered back a pace or two until he came to a table, at which
he clutched for support.  He turned very pale as he said, in a faint voice, 
--
 
     "Is -- is she mad, or am I?"
 
     "Tell him that I am mad, Henry," cried Flora.  "Do not, oh, do not make
his lonely thoughts terrible with more than that. Tell him I am mad."
 
     "Come with me," whispered Henry to Holland.  "I pray you come with me 
at
once, and you shall know all."
 
     "I -- will."
 
     "George, stay with Flora for a time.  Come, come, Mr. Holland, you 
ought,
and you shall know all; then you can come to a judgment for yourself.  This
way, sir.  You cannot, in the wildest freak of your imagination, guess that 
I
have now to tell you."
 
     Never was mortal man so utterly bewildered by the events of the last 
hour
of his existence as was now Charles Holland, and truly he might well be so. 
He had arrived in England, and made what speed he could to the house of a
family whom he admired for their intelligence, their high culture, and in 
one
member of which his whole thoughts of domestic happiness in this world were
centered, and he found nothing but confusion, incoherence, mystery, and the
wildest dismay.
 
     Well might he doubt if he were sleeping or waking -- well might he ask 
if
he or they were mad.
 
     And now, as, after a long, lingering look of affection upon the pale,
suffering form of Flora, he followed Henry from the room, his thoughts were
busy in fancying a thousand vague and wild imaginations with respect to the
communication which was promised to be made to him.
 
     But, as Henry had truly said to him, not in the wildest freak of his
imagination could he conceive of anything near the terrible strangeness and
horror of that which he had to tell him, and consequently he found himself
closeted with Henry in a small private room, removed from the domestic part 
of
the hall, to the full in as bewildered a state as he had been from the 
first.

 Next Time: The Communication to the Lover. -- The Heart's Despair.




                                 Chapter XI.

THE COMMUNICATION TO THE LOVER. -- THE HEART'S DESPAIR.

     Consternation is sympathetic, and any one who had looked upon the
features of Charles Holland, now that he was seated with Henry Bannerworth, 
in
expectation of a communication which his fears told him was to blast all the
dearest and most fondly cherished hopes for ever, would scarcely have
recognised in him the same young man who, one short hour before, had knocked
so loudly, and so full of joyful hope and expectation, at the door of the
hall.

     But so it was.  He knew Henry Bannerworth too well to suppose that any
unreal cause could blanch his cheek.  He knew Flora too well to imagine for
one moment that caprice had dictated the, to him, fearful words of dismissal
she had uttered to him.

     Happier would it at that time have been to Charles Holland had she 
acted
capriciously towards him, and convinced him that his true heart's devotion 
had
been cast at the feet of one unworthy of so really noble a gift.  Pride 
would
then have enabled him, no doubt, successfully to resist the blow.  A feeling
of honest and proper indignation at having his feelings trifled with, would,
no doubt, have sustained him; but, alas! the case seemed to be widely
different.

     True, she implored him to think of her no more -- no longer to cherish 
in
his breast the fond dream of affection which had been its guest so long; but
the manner in which she did so brought along with it an irresistible
conviction, that she was making a noble sacrifice of her own feelings for 
him,
from some cause which was involved in the profoundest mystery.

     But now he was to hear all.  Henry had promised to tell him, and as he
looked into his pale, but handsomely intellectual face, he half dreaded the
disclosure he yet panted to hear.

     "Tell me all, Henry -- tell me all," he said. "Upon the words that come
from your lips I know I can rely."

     "I will have no reservations with you," said Henry, sadly.  "You ought 
to
know all, and you shall.  Prepare yourself for the strangest revelation you
ever heard."

     "Indeed!"

     "Ay.  One which in hearing you may well doubt; and one which, I hope 
you
will never find opportunity of verifying."

     "You speak in riddles."

     "And yet speak truly, Charles.  You heard with what a frantic vehemence
Flora desired you to think no more of her?"

     "I did -- I did."

     "She was right.  She is a noble-hearted girl for uttering those words.  
A
dreadful incident in our family has occurred, which might well induce you to
pause before uniting your fate with that of any member of it."

     "Impossible.  Nothing can possibly subdue the feelings of affection I
entertain for Flora.  She is worthy of any one, and, as such, amid all 
changes
-- all mutations of fortune, she shall be mine."

     "Do not suppose that any change of fortune has produced the scene you
were witness to."

     "Then, what else?"

     "I will tell you, Holland.  In all your travels, and in all your 
reading,
did you ever come across anything about vampyres?"

     "About what?" cried Charles, drawing his chair forward a little.  
"About
what?"

     "You may well doubt the evidence of your own ears, Charles Holland, and
wish me to repeat what I said.  I say, do you know anything about vampyres?"

     Charles Holland looked curiously in Henry's face, and the latter
immediately added, --

     "I can guess what is passing in your mind at present, and I do not 
wonder
at it.  You think I must be mad."

     "Well, really, Henry, your extraordinary question -- "

     "I knew it.  Were I you, I should hesitate to believe the tale; but the
fact is, we have every reason to believe that one member of our own family 
is
one of those horrible preternatural beings called vampyres."

     "Good God, Henry, can you allow your judgment for a moment to stoop to
such a superstition?"

     "That's what I have asked myself a hundred times; but, Charles Holland,
the judgment, the feelings, and all the prejudices, natural and acquired, 
must
succumb to actual ocular demonstration.  Listen to me, and do not interrupt
me.  You shall know all, and you shall know it circumstantially."

     Henry then related to the astonished Charles Holland all that had
occurred, from the first alarm of Flora, up to that period when he, Holland,
caught her in his arms as she was about to leave the room.

     "And now," he said in conclusion, "I cannot tell what opinion you may
come to as regards these most singular events.  You will recollect that here
is the unbiased evidence of four or five people to the facts, and, beyond
that, the servants, who have seen something of the horrible visitor."

     "You bewilder me, utterly," said Charles Holland.

     "As we are all bewildered."

     "But -- but, gracious Heaven! it cannot be."

     "It is."

     "No -- no.  There is -- there must be yet some dreadful mistake."

     "Can you start any supposition by which we can otherwise explain any of
the phenomena I have described to you?  If you can, for Heaven's sake do so,
and you will find no one who will cling to it with more tenacity than I."

     "Any other species or kind of supernatural appearance might admit of
argument; but this, to my perception, is too wildly improbable -- too much 
at
variance with all we see and know of the operations of nature."

     "It is so.  All that we have told ourselves repeatedly, and yet is all
human reason at once struck down by the few brief words of -- 'We have seen
it.'"

     "I would doubt my eyesight."

     "One might; but many cannot be labouring under the same delusion."

     "My friend, I pray you, do not make me shudder at the supposition that
such a dreadful thing as this is possible."

     "I am, believe me, Charles, most unwilling to oppress any one with the
knowledge of these evils; but you will clearly understand that you may, with
perfect honour, now consider yourself free from all engagements you have
entered into with Flora."

     "No, no!  By Heaven, no!"

     "Yes, Charles.  Reflect upon the consequences now of a union with such 
a
family."

     "Oh, Henry Bannerworth, can you suppose me so dead to all good feeling,
so utterly lost to honourable impulses, as to eject from my heart her who 
has
possession of it entirely, on such a ground as this?"

     "You would be justified."

     "Coldly justified in prudence I might be.  There are a thousand
circumstances in which a man may be justified in a particular course of
action, and that course yet may be neither honourable nor just.  I love 
Flora;
and were she tormented by the whole of the supernatural world, I should 
still
love her.  Nay, it becomes, then, a higher and a nobler duty on my part to
stand between her and those evils, if possible."

     "Charles -- Charles," said Henry, "I cannot of course refuse you my 
meed
of praise and admiration for your generosity of feeling; but, remember, if 
we
are compelled, despite all our feelings and all our predilections to the
contrary, to give in to a belief in the existence of vampyres, why may we 
not
at once receive as the truth all that is recorded of them?"

     "To what do you allude?"

     "To this.  That one who has been visited by a vampyre, and whose blood
has formed a horrible repast for such a being, becomes, after death, one of
the dreadful race, and visits others in the same way."

     "Now this must be insanity," cried Charles.

     "It bears the aspect of it, indeed," said Henry; "oh that you could by
some means satisfy yourself that I am mad."

     "There may be insanity in this family," thought Charles, with such an
exquisite pang of misery that he groaned aloud.

     "Already," added Henry, mournfully, "already the blighting influence of
the dreadful tale is upon you, Charles.  Oh, let me add my advice to Flora's
entreaties.  She loves you, and we all esteem you; fly, then, from us, and
leave us to encounter our miseries alone.  Fly from us, Charles Holland, and
take with you our best wishes for happiness which you cannot know here."

     "Never," cried Charles; "I devote my existence to Flora.  I will not 
play
the coward, and fly from one whom I love, on such grounds.  I devote my life
to her."

     Henry could not speak for emotion for several minutes, and when at
length, in a faltering voice, he could utter some words, he said, --

     "God of heaven, what happiness is marred by these horrible events?  
What
have we all done to be the victims of such a dreadful act of vengeance?"

     "Henry, do not talk in that way," cried Charles. "Rather let us bend 
all
our energies to overcoming the evil, than spend any time in useless
lamentations.  I cannot even yet give in to a belief in the existence of 
such
a being as you say visited Flora."

     "But the evidences."

     "Look you here, Henry:  until I am convinced that some things have
happened which it is totally impossible could happen by any human means
whatever, I will not ascribe them to supernatural influence."

     "But what human means, Charles, could produce what I have now narrated 
to
you?"

     "I do not know, just at present, but I will give the subject the most
attentive consideration.  Will you accommodate me here for a time?"

     "You know you are welcome here as if the house were your own, and all
that it contains."

     "I believe so, most truly.  You have no objection, I presume, to my
conversing with Flora upon this strange subject?"

     "Certainly not.  Of course you will be careful to say nothing which can
add to her fears."

     "I shall be most guarded, believe me.  You say that your brother 
George,
Mr. Chillingworth, yourself, and this Mr. Marchdale, have all been cognisant
of the circumstances."

     "Yes -- yes."

     "Then with the whole of them you permit me to hold free communication
upon the subject?"

     "Most certainly."

     "I will do so then.  Keep up good heart, Henry, and this affair, which
looks so full of terror at first sight, may yet be divested of some of its
hideous aspect."

     "I am rejoiced, if anything can rejoice me now," said Henry, "to see 
you
view the subject with so much philosophy."

     "Why," said Charles,  "you made a remark of your own, which enabled me,
viewing the matter in its very worst and most hideous aspect, to gather 
hope."

     "What was that?"

     "You said, properly and naturally enough, that if ever we felt that 
there
was such a weight of evidence in favour of a belief in the existence of
vampyres that we are compelled to succumb to it, we might as well receive 
all
the popular feelings and superstitions concerning them likewise."

     "I did.  Where is the mind to pause, when once we open it to the
reception of such things?"

     "Well, then, if that be the case, we will watch this vampyre and catch
it."

     "Catch it?"

     "Yes; surely it can be caught; as I understand, this species of being 
is
not like an apparition, that may be composed of thin air, and utterly
impalpable to the human touch, but it consists of a revivified corpse."

     "Yes, yes."

     "Then it is tangible and destructible.  By Heaven! if ever I catch a
glimpse of any such thing, it shall drag me to its home, be that where it 
may,
or I will make it prisoner."

     "Oh, Charles! you know not the feeling of horror that will come across
you when you do.  You have no idea of how the warm blood will seem to curdle
in your veins, and how you will be paralysed in every limb."

     "Did you feel so?"

     "I did."

     "I will endeavour to make head against such feelings.  The love of 
Flora
shall enable me to vanquish them.  Think you it will come again to-morrow?"

     "I can have no thought one way or the other."

     "It may.  We must arrange among us all, Henry, some plan of watching
which, without completely prostrating our health and strength, will always
provide that some one shall be up all night and on the alert."

     "It must be done."

     "Flora ought to sleep with the consciousness now that she has ever at
hand some intrepid and well-armed protector, who is not only himself 
prepared
to defend her, but who can in a moment give an alarm to us all, in case of
necessity requiring it."

     "It would be a dreadful capture to make to seize a vampyre," said 
Henry.

     "Not at all; it would be a very desirable one. Being a corpse 
revivified,
it is capable of complete destruction, so as to render it no longer a 
scourge
to any one."

     "Charles, Charles, are you jesting with me, or do you really give any
credence to the story?"

     "My dear friend, I always make it a rule to take things at their worst,
and then I cannot be disappointed.  I am content to reason upon this matter 
as
if the fact of the existence of a vampyre were thoroughly established, and
then to think upon what is best to be done about it."

     "You are right."

     "If it should turn out then that there is an error in the fact, well 
and
good -- we are all the better off; but if otherwise, we are prepared, and
armed at all points."

     "Let it be so, then.  It strikes me, Charles, that you will be the
coolest and the calmest among us all on the emergency; but the hour now 
waxes
late, I will get them to prepare a chamber for you, and at least to-night,
after what has occurred already, I should think we can be under no
apprehension."

     "Probably not.  But, Henry, if you would allow me to sleep in that room
where the portrait hangs of him whom you suppose to be the vampyre, I should
prefer it."

     "Prefer it!"

     "Yes; I am not one who courts danger for danger's sake, but I would
rather occupy that room, to see if the vampyre, who perhaps has a partiality
for it, will pay me a visit."

     "As you please, Charles.  You can have the apartment.  It is in the 
same
state as when occupied by Flora.  Nothing has been, I believe, removed from
it."

     "You will let me, then, while I remain here, call it my room?"

     "Assuredly."

     This arrangement was accordingly made to the surprise of all the
household, not one of whom would, indeed, have slept, or attempted to sleep
there for any amount of reward.  But Charles Holland had his own reasons for
preferring that chamber, and he was conducted to it in the course of half an
hour by Henry, who looked around it with a shudder, as he bade his young
friend good night.

 Next Time: Charles Holland's Sad Feelings. -- The Portrait. -- The 
Occurrence
 of the Night at the Hall.




                               Chapter XII.

CHARLES HOLLAND'S SAD FEELINGS. -- THE PORTRAIT. -- THE OCCURRENCE OF THE
NIGHT AT THE HALL.


     Charles Holland wished to be alone, if ever any human being had wished
fervently to be so.  His thoughts were most fearfully oppressive.  The
communication that had been made to him by Henry Bannerworth, had about it 
too
many strange, confirmatory circumstances to enable him to treat it, in his 
own
mind, with the disrespect that some mere freak of a distracted and weak
imagination would, most probably, received from him.

     He had found Flora in a state of excitement which could arise only from
some such terrible cause as had been mentioned by her brother, and then he
was, from an occurrence which certainly never could have entered into his
calculations, asked to forego the bright dream of happiness which he had 
held
so long and so rapturously to his heart.

     How truly he found that the course of true love ran not smooth; and yet
how little would any one have suspected that from such a cause as that which
now oppressed his mind, any obstruction would arise.

     Flora might have been fickle and false; he might have seen some other
fairer face, which might have enchained his fancy, and woven for him a new
heart's chain; death might have stepped between him and the realization of 
his
fondest hopes; loss of fortune might have made love cruel which would have
yoked to its distresses a young and beautiful girl, reared in the lap of
luxury, and who was not, even by those who loved her, suffered to feel, even
in later years, any of the pinching necessities of the family.

     All these things were possible -- some of them were probable; and yet
none of them had occurred.  She loved him still; and he, although he had
looked on many a fair face, and basked in the sunny smile of beauty, had 
never
for a moment forgotten her faith, or lost his devotion to his own dear 
English
girl.

     Fortune he had enough for both; death had not even threatened to rob 
him
of the prize of such a noble and faithful heart which he had won.  But a
horrible superstition had arisen, which seemed to place at once an 
impassable
abyss between them, and to say to him, in a voice of thundering 
denunciation,
--

     "Charles Holland, will you have a vampyre for your bride?"

     The thought was terrific.  He paced the gloomy chamber to and fro with
rapid strides, until the idea came across his mind that by so doing he might
not only be proclaiming to his kind entertainers how much he was mentally
distracted, but he likewise might be seriously distracting them.

     The moment this occurred to him he sat down, and was profoundly still 
for
some time.  He then glanced at the light which had been given to him, and he
found himself almost unconsciously engaged in a mental calculation as to how
long it would last him in the night.

     Half ashamed, then, of such terrors, as such a consideration would seem
to indicate, he was on the point of hastily extinguishing it, when he 
happened
to cast his eyes on the now mysterious and highly interesting portrait in 
the
panel.

     The picture, as a picture, was well done, whether it was a correct
likeness or not of the party whom it represented.  It was one of those kind 
of
portraits that seem so lifelike, that, as you look at them, they seem to
return your gaze fully, and even to follow you with their eyes from place to
place.

     By candle-light such an effect is more likely to become striking and
remarkable than by daylight; and now, as Charles Holland shaded his eyes 
from
the light, so as to cast its full radiance upon the portrait, he felt
wonderfully interested in its life-like appearance.

     "Here is true skill," he said; "such as I have not before seen.  How
strangely this likeness of a man whom I never saw seems to gaze upon me."

     Unconsciously, too, he aided the effect, which he justly enough called
life-like, by a slight movement of the candle, such as any one not blessed
with nerves of iron would be sure to make, and such a movement made the face
look as if it was inspired with vitality.

     Charles remained looking at the portrait for a considerable period of
time.  He found a kind of fascination in it which prevented him from drawing
his eyes away from it.  It was not fear which induced him to continue gazing
on it, but the circumstance that it was a likeness of the man who, after
death, was supposed to have borrowed so new and so hideous an existence,
combined with its artistic merits, chained him to the spot.

     "I shall now," he said, "know that face again, let me see it where I 
may,
or under what circumstances I may.  Each feature is now indelibly fixed upon
my memory -- I can never mistake it."

     He turned aside as he uttered these words, and as he did so his eyes 
fell
upon a part of the ornamental frame which composed the edge of the panel, 
and
which seemed to him to be of a different colour from the surrounding 
portion.

     Curiosity and increased interest prompted him at once to make a closer
inquiry into the matter; and by a careful and diligent scrutiny, he was 
almost
induced to come to the positive opinion, that at no very distant period in
time past, the portrait had been removed from the place it occupied.

     When once this idea, even vague and indistinct as it was, in 
consequence
of the slight grounds he had formed it on, had got possession of his mind, 
he
felt most anxious to prove its verification or its fallacy.

     He held the candle in a variety of situations, so that its light fell 
in
different ways on the picture; and the more he examined it, the more he felt
convinced that it must have been moved lately.

     It would appear as if, in its removal, a piece of the old oaken carved
framework of the panel had been accidentally broken off, which caused the 
new
look of the fracture, and that this accident, from the nature of the broken
bit of framing, could have occurred in any other way than from an actual or
attempted removal of the picture, he felt was extremely unlikely.

     He set down the candle on a chair near at hand, and tried if the panel
was fast in its place.  Upon the very first touch, he felt convinced it was
not so, and that it was easily moved.  How to get it out, though, presented 
a
difficulty, and to get it out was tempting.

     "Who knows," he said to himself, "what may be behind it?  This is an 
old
baronial sort of hall, and the greater portion of it was, no doubt, built at 
a
time when the construction of such places as hidden chambers and intricate
staircases were, in all buildings of importance, considered desiderata."

     That he should make some discovery behind the portrait, now became an
idea that possessed him strongly, although he certainly had no definite
grounds for really supposing that he should do so.

     Perhaps the wish was more father to the thought than he, in the partial
state of excitement he was in, really imagined; but so it was.  He felt
convinced that he should not be satisfied until he had removed that panel 
from
the wall, and seen what was immediately behind it.

     After the panel containing the picture had been placed where it was, it
appeared that pieces of moulding had been inserted all around, which had had
the effect of keeping it in its place, and it was a fracture of one of these
pieces which had first called Charles Holland's attention to the probability
of the picture having been removed.  That he should have to get two, at 
least,
of the pieces of moulding away, before he could hope to remove the picture,
was to him quite apparent, and he was considering how he should accomplish
such a result, when he was suddenly startled by a knock at his chamber door.

     Until that sudden demand for admission at his door came, he scarcely 
knew
to what a nervous state he had worked himself up.  It was an odd sort of tap
-- one only - a single tap, as if some one demanded admittance, and wished 
to
awaken his attention with the least possible chance of disturbing any one
else.

     "Come in," said Charles, for he knew he had not fastened his door; 
"come
in."

     There was no reply, but after a moment's pause, the same sort of low 
tap
came again.

     Again he cried "come in," but, whoever it was, seemed determined that 
the
door should be opened for him, and no movement was made from the outside.  A
third time the tap came, and Charles was very close to the door when he 
heard
it, for with a noiseless step he had approached it intending to open it.  
The
instant this third mysterious demand for admission came, he did open it 
wide. 
There was no one there!  In an instant he crossed the threshold into the
corridor, which ran right and left.  A window at one end of it now sent in 
the
moon's rays, so that it was tolerably light, but he could see no one.  
Indeed,
to look for any one, he felt sure was needless, for he had opened his
chamber-door almost simultaneously with the last knock for admission.

     "It is strange," he said, as he lingered on the threshold of his room
door for some moments; "my imagination could not so completely deceive me. 
There was most certainly a demand for admission."

     Slowly, then, he returned to his room again, and closed the door behind
him.

     "One thing is evident," he said, "that if I am in this apartment and to
be subjected to these annoyances, I shall get no rest, which will soon 
exhaust
me."

     This thought was a very provoking one, and the more he thought that he
should ultimately find a necessity for giving up that chamber he had himself
asked as a special favour to be allowed to occupy, the more vexed he became 
to
think what construction might be put upon his conduct for so doing.

     "They will fancy me a coward," he thought, "and that I dare not sleep
here.  They may not, of course, say so, but they will think that my 
appearing
so bold was one of those acts of bravado which I have not courage to carry
fairly out."

     Taking this view of the matter was just the way to enlist a young man's
pride in staying, under all circumstances, where he was, and, with a slight
accession of colour, which, even although he was alone, would visit his
cheeks, Charles Holland said aloud, --

     "I will remain the occupant of this room come what may, happen what 
may. 
No terrors, real or unsubstantial, shall drive me from it:  I will brave 
them
all, and remain here to brave them."

     Tap came the knock at the door again, and now, with more an air of
vexation than fear, Charles turned again towards it, and listened.  Tap in
another minute again succeeded, and most annoyed, he walked close to the 
door,
and laid his hand upon the lock, ready to open it at the precise moment of
another demand for admission being made.

     He had not to wait long.  In about half a minute it came again, and,
simultaneously with the sound, the door flew open.  There was no one to be
seen; but, as he opened the door, he heard  a strange sound in the corridor 
--
a sound which scarcely could be called a groan, and scarcely a sigh, but
seemed a compound of both, having the agony of the one combined with the
sadness of the other.  From what direction it came he could not at the 
moment
decide, but he called out, --

     "Who's there? who's there?"

     The echo of his own voice alone answered him for a few moments, and 
then
he heard a door open, and a voice, which he knew to be Henry's, cried, --

     "What is it? who speaks?"

     "Henry," said Charles.

     "Yes -- yes -- yes."

     "I fear I have disturbed you."

     "You have been disturbed yourself, or you would not have done so.  I
shall be with you in a moment."

     Henry closed his door before Charles Holland could tell him not to come
to him, as he intended to do, for he felt ashamed to have, in a manner of
speaking, summoned assistance for so trifling a cause of alarm as that to
which he had been subjected.  However, he could not go to Henry's chamber to
forbid him from coming to his, and, more vexed than before, he retired to 
his
room again to await his coming.

     He left the door open now, so that Henry Bannerworth, when he had got 
on
some articles of dress, walked in at once, saying, --

     "What has happened, Charles?"

     "A mere trifle, Henry, concerning which I am ashamed you should have 
been
at all disturbed."

     "Never mind that, I was wakeful."

     "Did you hear me open my door?"

     "I heard a door open, which kept me listening, but I could not decide
which door it was till I heard your voice in the corridor."

     "Well, it was this door; and I opened it twice in consequence of the
repeated taps for admission that came to it; some one had been knocking at 
it,
and, when I go to it, lo! I can see nobody."

     "Indeed!"

     "Such is the case."

     "You surprise me."

     "I am very sorry to have disturbed you, because, upon such a ground, I 
do
not feel that I ought to have done so; and, when I called out in the 
corridor,
I assure you it was with no such intention."

     "Do not regret it for a moment," said Henry; "you were quite justified 
in
making an alarm on such an occasion."

     "It's strange enough, but still it may arise from some accidental 
cause;
admitting, if we did but know it, of some ready enough explanation."

     "It may, certainly, but, after what has happened already, we may well
suppose a mysterious connexion between any unusual sight or sound, and the
fearful ones we have already seen."

     "Certainly we may."

     "How earnestly that strange portrait seems to look upon us, Charles."

     "It does, and I have been examining it carefully. It seems to have been
removed lately."

     "Removed!"

     "Yes, I think as far as I can judge, that it has been taken from its
frame; I mean, that the panel on which it is painted has been taken out."

     "Indeed!"

     "If you touch it you will find it loose, and, upon a close examination,
you will perceive that a piece of the moulding which holds it in its place 
has
been chipped off, which is done in such a place what I think it could only
have arisen during the removal of the picture."

     "You must be mistaken."

     "I cannot, of course, take upon myself, Henry, to say precisely such is
the case," said Charles.

     "But there is no one here to do so."

     "That I cannot say.  Will you permit me and assist me to remove it?  I
have a great curiosity to know what is behind it."

     "If you have, I certainly will do so.  We thought of taking it away
altogether, but when Flora left this room the idea was given up as useless. 
Remain here a few moments, and I will endeavour to find something which 
shall
assist us in its removal."

     Henry left the mysterious chamber in order to search in his own for 
some
means of removing the frame-work of the picture, so that the panel would 
slip
easily out, and while he was gone, Charles Holland continued gazing upon it
with greater interest, if possible, than before.

     In a few minutes Henry returned, and although what he had succeeded in
finding were very inefficient implements for the purpose, yet with this aid
the two young men set about the task.

     It is said, and said truly enough, that "where there is a will there is 
a
way," and although the young men had no tools at all adapted for the 
purpose,
they did succeed in removing the moulding from the sides of the panel, and
then by a little tapping at one end of it, and using a knife as a lever at 
the
other end of the panel, they got it fairly out.

     Disappointment was all they got for their pains. On the other side 
there
was nothing but a rough wooded wall, against which the finer and more nicely
finished oak panelling of the chamber rested.

     "There is no mystery here," said Henry.

     "None whatever," said Charles, as he tapped the wall with his knuckles,
and found all hard and sound. "We are foiled."

     "We are indeed."

     "I had a strange presentiment, now," added Charles, "that we should 
make
some discovery that would repay us for our trouble.  It appears, however, 
that
such is not to be the case; for you see nothing presents itself to us but 
the
most ordinary appearances."

     "I perceive as much; and the panel itself, although of more than 
ordinary
thickness, is, after all, but a bit of planed oak, and apparently fashioned
for no other object than to paint the portrait on."

     "True.  Shall we replace it?"

     Charles reluctantly assented, and the picture was replaced in its
original position.  We say Charles reluctantly assented, because, although 
he
had now had ocular demonstration that there was really nothing behind the
panel but the ordinary woodwork which might have been expected from the
construction of the old house, but he could not, even with such a fact 
staring
him in the face, get rid entirely of the feeling that had come across him, 
to
the effect that the picture had some mystery or another.

     "You are not yet satisfied," said Henry, as he observed the doubtful 
look
of Charles Holland's face.

     "My dear friend," said Charles, "I will not deceive you.  I am much
disappointed that we have made no discovery behind that picture."

     "Heaven knows we have mysteries enough in our family," said Henry.

     Even as he spoke they were both startled by a strange clattering noise 
at
the window, which was accompanied by a shrill, odd kind of shriek, which
sounded fearful and preternatural on the night air.

     "What is that?" said Charles.

     "God only knows," said Henry.

     The two young men naturally turned their earnest gaze in the direction 
of
the window, which we have before remarked was one unprovided with shutters,
and there, to their intense surprise, they saw, slowly rising up from the
lower part of it, what appeared to be a human form.  Henry would have dashed
forward, but Charles restrained him, and drawing quickly from its case a 
large
holster pistol, he levelled it carefully at the figure, saying in a whisper,
--

     "Henry, if I don't hit it, I will consent to forfeit my head."

     He pulled the trigger -- a loud report followed -- the room was filled
with smoke, and then all was still. A circumstance, however, had occurred, 
as
a consequence of the concussion of the air produced by the discharge of the
pistol, which neither of the young men had for the moment calculated upon, 
and
that was the putting out of the only light they there had.

     In spite of this circumstance, Charles, the moment he had discharged 
the
pistol, dropped it and sprung forward to the window.  But here he was
perplexed, for he could not find the old fashioned, intricate fastening 
which
held it shut, and he had to call to Henry, --

     "Henry!  For God's sake open the window for me, Henry!  The fastening 
of
the window is known to you, but not to me.  Open it for me."

     Thus called upon, Henry sprung forward, and by this time the report of
the pistol had effectually alarmed the whole household.  The flashing of
lights from the corridor came into the room, and in another minute, just as
Henry succeeded in getting the window wide open, and Charles Holland had 
made
his way on to the balcony, both George Bannerworth and Mr. Marchdale entered
the chamber, eager to know what had occurred. To their eager questions Henry
replied, --

     "Ask me not now;" and then calling to Charles, he said, -- "Remain 
where
you are, Charles, while I run down to the garden immediately beneath the
balcony."

     "Yes -- yes," said Charles.

     Henry made prodigious haste, and was in the garden immediately below 
the
bay window in a wonderfully short space of time.  He spoke to Charles, 
saying,
--

     "Will you now descend?  I can see nothing here; but we will both make a
search."

     George and Mr. Marchdale were both now in the balcony, and they would
have descended likewise, but Henry said, --

     "Do not all leave the house.  God only knows, now, situated as we are,
what might happen."

     "I will remain, then," said George.  "I have been sitting up to-night 
as
the guard, and, therefore, may as well continue to do so."

     Marchdale and Charles Holland clambered over the balcony, and easily,
from its insignificant height, dropped into the garden.  The night was
beautiful, and profoundly still.  There was not a breath of air sufficient 
to
stir a leaf on a tree, and the very flame of the candle which Charles had 
left
burning in the balcony burnt clearly and steadily, being perfectly unruffled
by any wind.

     It cast a sufficient light close to the window to make everything very
plainly visible, and it was evident at a glance that no object was there,
although had that figure, which Charles had shot at, and no doubt hit, been
flesh and blood, it must have dropped immediately below.

     As they looked up for a moment after a cursory examination of the 
ground,
Charles exclaimed, --

     "Look at the window!  As the light is now situated, you can see the 
hole
made in one of the panes of glass by the passage of the bullet from my
pistol."

     They did look, and there the clear, round hole, without any starring,
which a bullet discharged close to a pane of glass will make in it, was
clearly and plainly discernible.

     "You must have hit him," said Henry.

     "One would think so," said Charles; "for that was the exact place where
the figure was."

     "And there is nothing here," added Marchdale. "What can we think of 
these
events -- what resource has the mind against the most dreadful suppositions
concerning them?"

     Charles and Henry both were silent; in truth, they knew not what to 
think
and the words uttered by Marchdale were too strikingly true to dispute for a
moment.  They were lost in wonder.

     "Human means against such an appearance as we saw to-night," said
Charles, "are evidently useless."

     "My dear young friend," said Marchdale, with much emotion, as he 
grasped
Henry Bannerworth's hand, and the tears stood in his eyes as he did so, -- 
"my
dear young friend, these constant alarms will kill you. They will drive you,
and all whose happiness you hold dear, distracted.  You must control these
dreadful feelings, and there is but one chance that I can see of getting the
better of these."

     "What is that?"

     "By leaving this place for ever."

     "Alas! am I to be driven from the home of my ancestors from such a 
cause
as this?  And whither am I to fly?  Where are we to find a refuge?  To leave
here will be at once to break up the establishment which is now held 
together,
certainly upon the sufferance of creditors, but still to their advantage,
inasmuch as I am doing what no one else would do, namely, paying away to
within the scantiest pittance the whole proceeds of the estate which spreads
around me."

     "Heed nothing but an escape from such horrors as seem to be 
accumulating
now around you."

     "If I were sure that such a removal would bring with it such a
corresponding advantage, I might, indeed, be induced to risk all to 
accomplish
it."

     "As regards poor dear Flora," said Mr. Marchdale, "I know not what to
say, or what to think; she has been attacked by a vampyre, and after this
mortal life shall have ended, it is dreadful to think there may be a
possibility that she, with all her beauty, all her excellence and purity of
mind, and all those virtues and qualities which should make her the beloved 
of
all, and which do, indeed, attach all hearts towards her, should become one 
of
that dreadful tribe of beings who cling to existence by feeding, in the most
dreadful manner, upon the life blood of others -- oh, it is dreadful to
contemplate!  Too horrible -- too horrible!"

     "Then wherefore speak of it?" said Charles, with some asperity.  "Now, 
by
the great God of Heaven, who sees all our hearts, I will not give in to such 
a
horrible doctrine!  I will not believe it; and were death itself my portion
for my want of faith, I would this moment die in my disbelief of anything so
truly fearful!"

     "Oh, my young friend," added Marchdale, "if anything could add to the
pangs which all who love, and admire, and respect Flora Bannerworth must 
feel
at the unhappy condition in which she is placed, it would be the noble 
nature
of you, who, under happier auspices, would have been her guide through life,
and the happy partner of her destiny."

     "As I will be still."

     "May Heaven forbid it!  We are now among ourselves, and can talk freely
upon such a subject.  Mr. Charles Holland, if you wed, you would look 
forward
to being blessed with children -- those sweet ties which bind the sternest
hearts to life with so exquisite a bondage.  Oh, fancy, then, for a moment,
the mother of your babes coming at the still hour of midnight to drain from
their veins the very life blood she gave to them.  To drive you and them mad
with the expected horror of such visitations -- to make your nights hideous 
--
your days but so many hours of melancholy retrospection.  Oh, you know not 
the
world of terror, on the awful brink of which you stand, when you talk of
making Flora Bannerworth a wife."

     "Peace! oh, peace!" said Henry.

     "Nay, I know my words are unwelcome," continued Mr. Marchdale.  "It
happens, unfortunately for human nature, that truth and some of our best and
holiest feelings are too often at variance, and hold a sad contest -- "

     "I will hear no more of this," cried Charles Holland, -- "I will hear 
no
more!"

     "I have done," said Mr. Marchdale.

     "And 'twere well you had not begun."

     "Nay, say not so.  I have but done what I considered a solemn duty."

     "Under that assumption of doing duty -- a solemn duty -- heedless of 
the
feelings and the opinions of others," said Charles, sarcastically, "more
mischief is produced -- more heart-burnings and anxieties caused, than by 
any
other two causes of such mischievous results combined.  I wish to hear no 
more
of this."

     "Do not be angered with Mr. Marchdale, Charles," said Henry.  "He can
have no motive but our welfare in what he said.  We should not condemn a
speaker because his words may not sound pleasant to our ears."

     "By Heaven!" said Charles, with animation, "I meant not to be 
illiberal;
but I will not, because I cannot see a man's motives for active interference
in the affairs of others, always be ready, merely on account of such
ignorance, to jump to a conclusion that they must be estimable."

     "To-morrow, I leave this house," said Marchdale.

     "Leave us?" exclaimed Henry.

     "Ay, for ever."

     "Nay, now, Mr. Marchdale, is this generous?"

     "Am I treated generously by one who is your own guest, and towards whom 
I
was willing to hold out the honest right hand of friendship?"

     Henry turned to Charles Holland, saying, --

     "Charles, I know your generous nature.  Say you meant no offence to my
mother's old friend."

     "If to say I meant no offence," said Charles, "is to say I meant no
insult, I say it freely."

     "Enough," cried Marchdale; "I am satisfied."

     "But do not," added Charles, "draw me any more such pictures as the one
you have already presented to my imagination, I beg of you.  From the
storehouse of my own fancy I can find quite enough to make me wretched, if I
choose to be so; but again and again do I say I will not allow this 
monstrous
superstition to tread me down, like the tread of a giant on a broken reed.  
I
will contend against it while I have life to do so."

     "Bravely spoken."

     "And when I desert Flora Bannerworth, may Heaven from that moment, 
desert
me!"

     "Charles!" cried Henry, with emotion, "dear Charles, my more than 
friend -
- brother of my heart -- noble Charles!"

     "Nay, Henry, I am not entitled to your praises.  I were base indeed to 
be
other than that which I purpose to be.  Come weal or woe -- come what may, I
am the affianced husband of your sister, and she, and she only, can break
asunder the tie that binds me to her."

 Next Time: The Offer for the Hall. -- The Visit to Sir Francis Varney. -- 
The
 Strange Resemblance. -- A Dreadful Suggestion.




                                Chapter XIII.

THE OFFER FOR THE HALL. -- THE VISIT TO SIR FRANCIS VARNEY. -- THE STRANGE
RESEMBLANCE. -- A DREADFUL SUGGESTION.


     The party made a strict search through every nook and corner of the
garden, but it proved to be a fruitless one:  not the least trace of any one
could be found.  There was only one circumstance, which was pondered over
deeply by them all, and that was that, beneath the window of the room in 
which
Flora and her mother sat while the brothers were on their visit to the vault
of their ancestors, were visible marks of blood to a considerable extent.

     It will be remembered that Flora had fired a pistol at the spectral
appearance, and that immediately upon that it had disappeared, after 
uttering
a sound which might well be construed into a cry of pain from a wound.

     That a wound then had been inflicted upon some one, the blood beneath 
the
window now abundantly testified; and when it was discovered, Henry and 
Charles
made a very close examination indeed of the garden, to discover what 
direction
the wounded figure, be it man or vampyre, had taken.

     But the closest scrutiny did not reveal to them a single spot of blood,
beyond the space immediately beneath the window; -- there the apparition
seemed to have received its wound, and then, by some mysterious means, to 
have
disappeared.

     At length, wearied with the continued excitement, combined with want of
sleep, to which they had been subjected, they returned to the hall.

     Flora, with the exception of the alarm she experienced from the firing 
of
the pistol, had met with no disturbance, and that, in order to spare her
painful reflections, they told her was merely done as a precautionary 
measure,
to proclaim to any one who might be lurking in the garden that the inmates 
of
the house were ready to defend themselves against any aggression.

     Whether or not she believed this kind deceit they knew not. She only
sighed deeply, and wept.  The probability is, that she more than suspected 
the
vampyre had made another visit, but they forbore to press the point; and,
leaving her with her mother, Henry and George went from her chamber again --
the former to endeavour to seek some repose, as it would be his turn to 
watch
on the succeeding night, and the latter to resume his station in a small 
room
close to Flora's chamber, where it had been agreed watch and ward should be
kept by turns while the alarm lasted.

     At length, the morning again dawned upon that unhappy family, and to 
none
were its beams more welcome.

     The birds sang their pleasant carols beneath the window. The sweet, 
deep-
coloured autumnal sun shone upon all objects with a golden lustre; and to 
look
abroad, upon the beaming face of nature, no one could for a moment suppose,
except from sad experience, that there were such things as gloom, misery, 
and
crime, upon the earth.

     "And must I," said Henry, as he gazed from a window of the hall upon 
the
undulating park, the majestic trees, the flowers, the shrubs, and the many
natural beauties with which the place was full, -- "must I be chased from 
this
spot, the home of my self and my kindred, by a phantom -- must I indeed seek
refuge elsewhere, because my own home has become hideous?"

     It was indeed a cruel and a painful thought!  It was one he yet would
not, could not be convinced was absolutely necessary. But now the sun was
shining:  it was morning; and the feelings, which found a home in his breast
amid the darkness, the stillness, and the uncertainty of night, were chased
away by those glorious beams of sunlight, that fell upon hill, valley, and
stream, and the thousand sweet sounds of life and animation that filled that
sunny air!

     Such a revulsion of feeling was natural enough.  Many of the distresses
and mental anxieties of night vanish with the night, and those which 
oppressed
the heart of Henry Bannerworth were considerably modified.

     He was engaged in these reflections when he heard the sound of the 
lodge
bell, and as a  visitor was now somewhat rare at this establishment, he 
waited
with some anxiety to see to whom he was indebted for so early a call.

     In the course of a few minutes, one of the servants came to him with a
letter in her hand.

     It bore a large handsome seal, and, from its appearance, would seem to
have come from some personage of consequence.  A second glance at it shewed
him the name of "Varney" in the corner, and, with some degree of vexation, 
he
muttered to himself,

     "Another condoling epistle from the troublesome neighbor whom I have 
not
yet seen."

     "If you please, sir," said the servant who had brought him the letter,
"as I'm here, and you are here, perhaps you'll have no objection to give me
what I'm to have for the day and two nights as I've been here, cos I can't
stay in the family as is so familiar with all sorts o' ghostesses:  I ain't
used to such company."

     "What do you mean?" said Henry.

     The question was a superfluous one:  too well he knew what the woman
meant, and the conviction came across his mind strongly that no domestic 
would
consent to live long in a house which was subject to such dreadful
visitations.

     "What does I mean!" said the woman, -- "why, sir, if it's all the same 
to
you, I don't myself come of a wampyre family, and I don't choose to remain 
in
a house where there is sich things encouraged.  That's what I means, sir."

     "What wages are owning to you?" said Henry.

     "Why, as to wages, I only comed here by the day."

     "Go, then, and settle with my mother.  The sooner you leave this house,
the better."

     "Oh, indeed, I'm sure I don't want to stay."

     This woman was one of these who were always armed at all points for a
row, and she had no notion of concluding any engagement, of any character
whatever, without some disturbance; therefore to see Henry take what she 
said
with such provoking calmness was aggravating in the extreme; but there was 
no
help for such a source of vexation.  She could find no other ground of 
quarrel
than what was connected with the vampyre, and, as Henry would not quarrel 
with
her on such a score, she was compelled to give it up in despair.

     When Henry found himself alone, and free from the annoyance of this
woman, he turned his attention to the letter he held in his hand, and which,
from the autograph in the corner, he knew came from his new neighbor, Sir
Francis Varney, whom, by some chance or another, he had never yet seen.

     To his great surprise, he found that the letter contained the following
words: --

     Dear Sir, -- "As a neighbour, by purchase of an estate contiguous to 
your
own, I am quite sure you have excused, and taken in good part, the cordial
offer I made to you of friendship and service some short time since; but 
now,
in addressing to you a distinct proposition, I trust I shall meet with an
indulgent consideration, whether such a proposition be accordant with your
views or not.

     "What I have heard from common report induces me to believe that
Bannerworth Hall cannot be a desirable residence for yourself, or your 
amiable
sister.  If I am right in that conjecture, and you have any serious thought 
of
leaving the place, I would earnestly recommend you, as one having some
experience in such descriptions of property, to sell it at once.

     "Now the proposition with which I conclude this letter is, I know, of a
character to make you doubt the disinterestedness of such advice; but that 
it
is disinterested, nevertheless, is a fact of which I can assure my own 
heart,
and of which I beg to assure you.  I propose, then, should you, upon
consideration, decide upon such a course of proceeding, to purchase of you 
the
Hall.  I do not ask for a bargain on account of any extraneous circumstances
which may at the present time depreciate the value of the property, but I am
willing to give a fair price for it. Under these circumstances, I trust, 
sir,
that you will give a kindly consideration to my offer, and even if you 
reject
it, I hope that, as neighbours, we may live on in peace and amity, and in 
the
interchange of those good offices which should subsist between us.  Awaiting
your reply,

     "Believe me to be, dear sir,

         "Your very obedient servant,

            "FRANCIS VARNEY.

     "To Henry Bannerworth, Esq."

     Henry, after having read this most unobjectionable letter through, 
folded
it up again, and placed it in his pocket. Clasping his hands, then, behind 
his
back, a favourite attitude of his when he was in deep contemplation, he 
paced
to and fro in the garden for some time in deep thought.

     "How strange," he muttered.  "It seems that every circumstance combines
to induce me to leave my old ancestral home.  It appears as if everything 
now
that happened had that direct tendency.  What can be the meaning of all 
this? 
'Tis very strange -- amazingly strange. Here arise circumstances which are
enough to induce any man to leave a particular place.  Then a friend, in 
whose
single-mindedness and judgment I know I can rely, advised that step, and
immediately upon the back of that comes a fair and candid offer."

     There was an apparent connexion between all these circumstances which
much puzzled Henry.  He walked to and fro for nearly an hour, until he heard 
a
hasty footstep approaching him and upon looking in the direction from whence
it came, he saw Mr. Marchdale.

     "I will seek Marchdale's advice," he said, "upon this matter.  I will
hear what he says concerning it."

     "Henry," said Marchdale, when he came sufficiently near to him for
conversation, "why do you remain here alone?"

     "I have received a communication from our neighbour, Sir Francis 
Varney,"
said Henry.

     "Indeed!"

     "It is here.  Peruse it for yourself, and then tell me, Marchdale,
candidly what you think of it."

     "I suppose," said Marchdale, as he opened the letter, "it is another
friendly note of condolence on the state of your domestic affairs, which, I
grieve to say, from the prattling of domestics, whose tongues it is quite
impossible to silence, have become the food for gossip all over the
neighboring villages and estates."

     "If anything could add another pang to those I have already been made 
to
suffer," said Henry, "it would certainly arise from being made the food of
vulgar gossip.  But read the letter, Marchdale.  You will find its contents 
of
a more important character than you anticipate."

     "Indeed!" said Marchdale, as he ran his eyes eagerly over the note.

     When he had finished it he glanced at Henry, who then said, --

     "Well, what is your opinion?"

     "I know not what to say, Henry.  You know that my own advice to you had
been to get rid of this place."

     "It has."

     "With the hope that the disagreeable affair connected with it now may
remain connected with it as a house, and not with you and yours as a 
family."

     "It may be so."

     "There appears to me every likelihood of it."

     "I do not know, " said Henry, with a shudder.  "I must confess,
Marchdale, that to my own perceptions it seems more probably that the
infliction we have experienced from the strange visiter, who seems now
resolved to pester us with visits, will rather attach to a family than to a
house.  The vampyre may follow us."

     "If so, of course the parting with the Hall would be a great pity, and 
no
gain."

     "None in the least."

     "Henry, a thought has struck me."

     "Let's hear it, Marchdale."

     "It is this: -- Suppose you were to try the experiment of leaving the
Hall without selling it.  Suppose for one year you were to let it to 
someone,
Henry."

     "It might be done."

     "Ay, and it might, with very great promise and candour, be proposed to
this very gentleman, Sir Francis Varney, to take it for one year, to see how
he likes it before becoming the possessor of it.  Then if he found himself
tormented by the vampyre, he need not complete the purchase, or if you found
that the apparition followed you from hence, you might yourself return,
feeling that perhaps here, in the spots familiar to your youth, you might be
most happy, even under such circumstances as at present oppress you."

     "Most happy!" ejaculated Henry.

     "Perhaps I should not have used that word."

     "I am sure you should not," said Henry, "when you speak of me."

     "Well -- well; let us hope that the time may not be very far distant 
when
I may use the term happy, as applied to you in the most conclusive and the
strongest manner it can be used."

     "Oh," said Henry, "I will hope; but do not mock me with it now,
Marchdale, I pray you."

     "Heaven forbid that I should mock you!"

     "Well -- well; I do not believe you are the man to do so to any one.  
But
about the affair of the house."

     "Distinctly, then, if I were you, I would call upon Sir Francis Varney,
and make him an offer to become a tenant of the hall for twelve months, 
during
which time you could go where you please, and test the fact of absence 
ridding
you or not ridding you of the dreadful visitant who makes the night here 
truly
hideous."

     "I will speak to my mother, to George, and to my sister of the matter. 
They shall decide."

     Mr. Marchdale now strove in every possible manner to raise the spirits 
of
Henry Bannerworth, by painting to him the future in far more radiant colours
than the present, and endeavoring to induce a belief in his mind that a 
short
period of time might after all replace in his mind, and the minds of those 
who
were naturally so dear to him, all their wonted serenity.

     Henry, although he felt not much comfort from these kindly efforts, yet
could feel gratitude to him who made them; and after expressing such a 
feeling
to Marchdale, in strong terms, he repaired to the house, in order to hold a
solemn consultation with those whom he felt ought to be consulted as well as
himself as to what steps should be taken with regard to the Hall.

     The proposition, or rather the suggestion, which had been made by
Marchdale upon the proposition of Sir Francis Varney, was in every respect 
so
reasonable and just, that it met, as was to be expected, with the 
concurrence
of every member of the family.

     Flora's cheeks almost resumed some of their wonted colour at the mere
thought now of leaving that home to which she had been at one time so much
attached.

     "Yes, dear Henry," she said, "let us leave here if you are agreeable so
to do, and in leaving this house, we will believe that we leave behind us a
world of terror."

     "Flora," remarked Henry, in a tone of slight reproach, "if you were so
anxious to leave Bannerworth Hall, why did you not say so before this
proposition came from other mouths?  You know your feelings upon such a
subject would have been laws to me."

     "I knew you were attached to the old house," said Flora; "and, besides,
events have come upon us all with such fearful rapidity, there has scarcely
been time to think."

     "True -- true."

     "And you will leave, Henry?"

     "I will call upon Sir Francis Varney myself, and speak to him upon the
subject."

     A new impetus to existence appeared now to come over the whole family, 
at
the idea of leaving a place which always would be now associated in their
minds with so much terror.  Each member of the family felt happier, and
breathed more freely than before, so that the change which had come over 
them
seemed almost magical.  And Charles Holland, too, was much better pleased, 
and
he whispered to Flora, --

     "Dear Flora, you will now surely no longer talk of driving from you the
honest heart that loves you?"

     "Hush, Charles, hush!" she said; "meet me in an hour hence in the 
garden,
and we will talk of this."

     "That hour will seem an age," he said.

     Henry, now, having made a determination to see Sir Francis Varney, lost
no time in putting it into execution.  At Mr. Marchdale's own request, he 
took
him with him, as it was desirable to have a third person present in the sort
of business negotiation which was going on.  The estate which had been so
recently entered upon by the person calling himself Sir Francis Varney, and
which common report said he had purchased, was a small, but complete 
property,
and situated so close to the grounds connected with Bannerworth Hall, that a
short walk soon placed Henry and Mr. Marchdale before the residence of this
gentleman, who had shown so kindly a feeling towards the Bannerworth family.

     "Have you seen Sir Francis Varney?" asked Henry of Mr. Marchdale, as he
rung the gate-bell.

     "I have not.  Have you?"

     "No; I never saw him.  It is rather awkward our both being absolute
strangers to his person."

     "We can but send in our names, however; and, from the great vein of
courtesy that runs through his letter, I have no doubt but we shall receive
the most gentlemanly reception from him."

     A servant in handsome livery appeared at the iron-gates, which opened
upon a lawn in the front of Sir Francis Varney's house, and to this domestic
Henry Bannerworth handed his card, on which he had written, in pencil,
likewise the name of Mr. Marchdale.

     "If your master," he said, "is within, we shall be glad to see him."

     "Sir Francis is at home, sir," was the reply, "although not very well. 
If you will be pleased to walk in, I will announce you to him."

     Henry and Marchdale followed the man into a handsome enough reception-
room where they were desired to wait while their names were announced.

     "Do you know if this gentleman be a baronet," said Henry, "or a knight
merely?"

     "I really do not; I never saw him in my life, or heard of him before he
came into this neighbourhood."

     "And I have been too much occupied with the painful occurrences of this
hall to know anything of our neighbours.  I dare say Mr. Chillingworth, if 
we
had thought to ask him, would have known something concerning him."

     "No doubt."

     This brief colloquy was put an end to by the servant, who said, --

     "My master, gentlemen, is not very well; but he begs me to present his
best compliments, and to say he is much gratified with your visit, and will 
be
happy to see you in his study."

     Henry and Marchdale followed the man up a flight of stone stairs, and
then they were conducted through a large apartment into a smaller one.  
There
was very little light in this small room; but at the moment of their 
entrance
a tall man, who was seated, rose, and, touching the spring of a blind that 
was
to the window, it was up in a moment, admitting a broad glare of light. A 
cry
of surprise, mingled with terror, came from Henry Bannerworth's lip.  _The
original of the portrait on the panel stood before him!_  There was the 
lofty
stature, the long, sallow face, the slightly projecting teeth, the dark,
lustrous, although somewhat sombre eyes; the expression of the features -- 
all
were alike.

     "Are you unwell, sir?" said Sir Francis Varney, in soft, mellow 
accents,
as he handed a chair to the bewildered Henry.

     "God of Heaven!" said Henry; "how like!"

     "You seem surprised, sir.  Have you ever seen me before?"

     Sir Francis drew himself up to his full height, and cast a strange 
glance
upon Henry, whose eyes were rivetted upon his face, as if with a species of
fascination which he could not resist.

     "Marchdale," Henry gasped; "Marchdale, my friend, Marchdale. I -- I am
surely mad."

     "Hush! be calm," whispered Marchdale.

     "Calm -- calm -- can you not see?  Marchdale, is this a dream?  Look --
look -- oh! look."

     "For God's sake, Henry, compose yourself."

     "Is your friend often thus?" said Sir Francis Varney, with the same
mellifluous tone which seemed habitual with him.

     "No, sir, he is not; but recent circumstances have shattered his 
nerves;
and, to tell the truth, you bear so strong a resemblance to an old portrait,
in his house, that I do not wonder so much as I otherwise should at his
agitation."

     "Indeed."

     "A resemblance!" said Henry;  "a resemblance!  God of Heaven! it is the
face itself."

     "You much surprise me," said Sir Francis.

     Henry sunk into the chair which was near him, and he trembled 
violently. 
The rush of painful thoughts and conjectures that came through his mind was
enough to make any one tremble. "Is this the vampyre?" was the horrible
question that seemed impressed upon his very brain, in letters of flame.  
"Is
this the vampyre?"

     "Are you better, sir?" said Sir Francis Varney, in his bland, musical
voice.  "Shall I order refreshment for you?"

     "No -- no," gasped Henry; "for the love of truth tell me! Is -- is your
name really Varney?"

     "Sir?"

     "Have you no other name to which, perhaps, a better title you could
urge?"

     "Mr. Bannerworth, I can assure you that I am too proud of the name of 
the
family to which I belong to exchange it for any other, be it what it may."

     "How wonderfully like!"

     "I grieve to see you so much distressed, Mr. Bannerworth.  I presume 
ill
health has thus shattered your nerves?"

     "No; ill health has not done the work.  I know not what to say, Sir
Francis Varney, to you; but recent events in my family have made the sight 
of
you full of horrible conjectures."

     "What mean you, sir?"

     "You know, from common report, that we have had a fearful visiter at 
our
house."

     "A vampyre, I have heard," said Sir Francis Varney, with a bland, and
almost beautiful smile, which displayed his white, glistening teeth to
perfection.

     "Yes; a vampyre, and -- and -- "

     "I pray you go on, sir; you surely are above the vulgar superstition of
believing in such matters?"

     "My judgment is assailed in too many ways and shapes for it to hold out
probably as it ought to do against so hideous a belief, but never was it so
much bewildered as now."

     "Why so?"

     "Because -- "

     "Nay, Henry," whispered Mr. Marchdale, "it is scarcely civil to tell 
Sir
Francis to his face, that he resembles a vampyre."

     "I must, I must."

     "Pray, sir," interrupted Varney to Marchdale, "permit Mr. Bannerworth 
to
speak here freely.  There is nothing in the whole world I so much admire as
candour."

     "Then you so much resemble the vampyre," added Henry, "that -- that I
know not what to think."

     "Is it possible?" said Varney.

     "It is a damning fact."

     "Well, it's unfortunate for me, I presume?  Ah!"

     Varney gave a twinge of pain, as if some sudden bodily ailment had
attacked him severely.

     "You are unwell, sir?" said Marchdale.

     "No, no -- no," he said;  "I -- hurt my arm, and happened accidentally 
to
touch the arm of this chair with it."

     "A hurt?" said Henry.

     "Yes, Mr. Bannerworth."

     "A -- a wound?"

     "Yes, a wound, but not much more than skin deep.  In fact, little 
beyond
an abrasion of the skin."

     "May I inquire how you came by it?"

     "Oh, yes.  A slight fall."

     "Indeed."

     "Remarkable, is it not?  Very remarkable.  We never know a moment when,
from some most trifling cause, we may receive some serious bodily hurt.  How
true it is, Mr. Bannerworth, that in the midst of life we are in death."

     "And equally true, perhaps," said Henry, "that in the midst of death
there may be found a horrible life."

     "Well, I should not wonder.  There are really so many strange things in
this world, that I have left off wondering at anything now."

     "There are strange things," said Henry.  "You wish to purchase of me 
the
Hall, sir?"

     "If you wish to sell."

     "You -- you are perhaps attached to the place?  Perhaps you recollected
it, sir, long ago?"

     "Not very long," smiled Sir Francis Varney.  "It seems a nice 
comfortable
old house; and the grounds, too, appear to be amazingly well wooded, which, 
to
one of rather a romantic temperament like myself, is always an additional
charm to a place.  I was extremely pleased with it the first time I beheld 
it,
and a desire to call myself the owner of it took possession of my mind.  The
scenery is remarkable for its beauty, and, from what I have seen of it, it 
is
rarely to be excelled.  No doubt you are greatly attached to it."

     It has been my home from infancy," returned Henry, "and being also the
residence of my ancestors for centuries, it is natural that I should be so."

     "True -- true."

     "The house, no doubt, has suffered much," said Henry, "within the last
hundred years."

     "No doubt it has.  A hundred years is a tolerable long space of time, 
you
know."

     "It is, indeed.  Oh, how any human life which is spun out to such an
extent, must lose its charms, by losing all its fondest and dearest
associations."

     "Ah, how true," said Sir Francis Varney.

     He had some minutes previously touched a bell, and at this moment a
servant brought in on a tray some wine and refreshments.

 Next Time: Henry's Agreement with Sir Francis Varney. -- The Sudden Arrival
 at the Hall. -- Flora's Alarm.




                                Chapter XIV.

HENRY'S AGREEMENT WITH SIR FRANCIS VARNEY. -- THE SUDDEN ARRIVAL AT THE 
HALL.
-- FLORA'S ALARM.

     On the tray which the servant brought into the room, were refreshments 
of
different kinds, including wine, and after waving his hand for the domestic 
to
retire, Sir Francis Varney said, --

     "You will be better, Mr. Bannerworth, for a glass of wind after your
walk, and you too, sir.  I am ashamed to say, I have quite forgotten your
name."

     "Marchdale."

     "Mr. Marchdale.  Ay, Marchdale.  Pray, sir, help yourself."

     "You take nothing yourself?" said Henry.

     "I am under a strict regimen," replied Varney.  "The simplest diet 
alone
does for me, and I have accustomed myself to long abstinence."

     "He will not eat or drink," muttered Henry, abstractedly.

     "Will you sell me the Hall?" said Sir Francis Varney.

     Henry looked in his face again, from which he had only momentarily
withdrawn his eyes, and he was then more struck than ever with the 
resemblance
between him and the portrait on the panel of what had been Flora's chamber. 
What made that resemblance, too, one about which there could scarcely be two
opinions, was the mark or cieatrix of a wound in the forehead, which the
painter had slightly indented in the portrait, but which was much more 
plainly
visible on the forehead of Sir Francis Varney.  Now that Henry observed the
distinctive mark, which he had not done before, he could feel no doubt, and 
a
sickening sensation came over him at the thought that he was actually now in
the presence of one of those terrible creatures, vampyres.

     "You do not drink," said Varney.  "Most young men are not so modest 
with
a decanter of unimpeachable wine before them.  Pray help yourself."

     "I cannot."

     Henry rose as he spoke, and turning to Marchdale, he said, in addition,
--


     "Will you come away?"

     "If you please," said Marchdale, rising.

     "But you have not, my dear sir," said Varney, "given me yet an answer
about the Hall?"

     "I cannot yet," answered Henry, "I will think.  My present impression 
is,
to let you have it on whatever terms you may yourself propose, always 
provided
you consent to one of mine."

     "Name it."

     "That you never show yourself in my family."

     "How very unkind.  I understand you have a charming sister, young,
beautiful, and accomplished.  Shall I confess, now, that I had hopes of 
making
myself agreeable to her?"

     "You make yourself agreeable to her?  The sight of you would blast her
for ever, and drive her to madness."

     "Am I so hideous?"

     "No, but -- you are -- "

     "Hush, Henry, hush," cried Marchdale.  "Remember you are in this
gentleman's house."

     "True, true.  Why does he tempt me to say these dreadful things?  I do
not want to say them."

     "Come away, then -- come away at once.  Sir Francis Varney, my friend,
Mr. Bannerworth, will think over your offer, and let you know.  I think you
may consider that your wish to become the purchaser of the Hall will be
complied with."

     "I wish to have it," said Varney, "and I can only say, that if I am
master of it, I shall be very happy to see any of the family on a visit at 
any
time."

     "A visit!" said Henry, with a shudder.  "A visit to the tomb were far
more desirable.  Farewell, sir."

     "Adieu," said Sir Francis Varney, and he made one of the most elegant
bows in the world, while there came over his face a peculiarity of 
expression
that was strange, if not painful, to contemplate.  In another minute Henry 
and
Marchdale were clear of the house, and with feelings of bewilderment and
horror, which beggar all description, poor Henry allowed himself to be led 
by
the arm by Marchdale to some distance, without uttering a word. When he did
speak, he said, --

     "Marchdale, it would be charity of some one to kill me."

     "To kill you?"

     "Yes, for I am certain otherwise that I must go mad."

     "Nay, nay; rouse yourself."

     "This man, Varney, is a vampyre."

     "Hush! hush!"

     "I tell you, Marchdale," cried Henry, in a wild, excited manner, "he is 
a
vampyre.  He is the dreadful being who visited Flora at the still hour of
midnight, and drained the life-blood from her veins.  He is a vampyre.  
There
are such things.  I cannot doubt now.  Oh, God, I wish now that your
lightnings would blast me, as here I stand, for ever into annihilation, for 
I
am going mad to be compelled to feel that such horrors can really have
existence."

     "Henry -- Henry."

     "Nay, talk not to me.  What can I do?  Shall I kill him?  Is it not a
sacred duty to destroy such a thing?  Oh, horror -- horror.  He must be 
killed
-- destroyed -- burnt, and the very dust to which he is consumed must be
scattered to the winds of Heaven.  It would be a deed well done, Marchdale."

     "Hush! hush!  These words are dangerous."

     "I care not."

     "What if they were overheard now by unfriendly ears?  What might not be
the uncomfortable results?  I pray you be more cautious what you say of this
strange man."

     "I must destroy him."

     "And wherefore?"

     "Can you ask?  Is he not a vampyre?"

     "Yes; but reflect, Henry, for a moment upon the length to which you 
might
carry out so dangerous an argument.  It is said that vampyres are made by
vampyres sucking the blood of those who, but for that circumstance, would 
have
died and gone to decay in the tomb along with ordinary mortals; but that 
being
so attacked during life by a vampyre, they themselves, after death, become
such."

     "Well -- well, what is that to me?"

     "Have you forgotten Flora?"

     A cry of despair came from poor Henry's lips, and in a moment he seemed
completely, mentally and physically, prostrated.

     "God of Heaven!" he moaned, "I had forgotten her!"

     "I thought you had."

     "Oh, if the sacrifice of my own life would suffice to put an end to all
this accumulating horror, how gladly would I lay it down.  Ay, in any way--
in any way.  No mode of death should appal me.  No amount of pain make me
shrink.  I could smile then upon the destroyer, and say, 'welcome-- welcome-
-
most welcome.'"

     "Rather, Henry, seek to live for those whom you love than die for them. 
Your death would leave them desolate.  In life you may ward off many a blow 
of
fate from them."

     "I may endeavour so to do."

     "Consider that Flora may be wholly dependent upon such kindness as you
may be able to bestow upon her."

     "Charles clings to her."

     "Humph!"

     "You do not doubt him?"

     "My dear friend, Henry Bannerworth, although I am not an old man, yet I
am so much older than you that I have seen a great deal of the world, and 
am,
perhaps, far better able to come to accurate judgments with regard to
individuals."

     "No doubt -- no doubt; but yet -- "

     "Nay, hear me out.  Such judgments, founded upon experience, when 
uttered
have all the character of prophecy about them.  I, therefore, now prophecy 
to
you that Charles Holland will yet be so stung with horror at the 
circumstance
of a vampyre visiting Flora, that he will never make her his wife."

     "Marchdale, I differ from you most completely," said Henry. "I know 
that
Charles Holland is the very soul of honour."

     "I cannot argue the matter with you.  It has not become a thing of 
fact. 
I have only sincerely to hope that I am wrong."

     "You are, you may depend, entirely wrong.  I cannot be deceived in
Charles.  From you such words produce no effect but one of regret that you
should so much err in your estimate of any one.  From any one but yourself
they would have produced in me a feeling of anger I might have found it
difficult to smother."

     "It has often been my misfortune through life," said Mr. Marchdale,
sadly, "to give the greatest offence where I feel the truest friendship,
because it is in such quarters that I am always tempted to speak too 
freely."

     "Nay, no offence," said Henry.  "I am distracted, and scarcely know 
what
I say.  Marchdale, I know that you are my sincere friend; but, I tell you, I
am nearly mad."

     "My dear Henry, be calmer.  Consider upon what is to be said concerning
this interview at home."

     "Ay; that is a consideration."

     "I should not think it advisable to mention the disagreeable fact, that
in your neighbour you think you have found out the nocturnal disturber of 
your
family."

     "No -- no."

     "I would say nothing of it.  It is not at all probable that, after what
you have said to him, this Sir Francis Varney, or whatever his real name may
be, will obtrude himself upon you."

     "If he should he surely dies."

     "He will, perhaps, consider that such a step would be dangerous to 
him."

     "It would be fatal, so help me, Heaven; and then would I take especial
care that no power of resuscitation should ever enable that man again to 
walk
the earth."

     "They say the only way of destroying a vampyre is to fix him to the 
earth
with a stake, so that he cannot move, and then, of course, decomposition 
will
take its course, as in ordinary cases."

     "Fire would consume him, and be a quicker process," said Henry.  "But
these are fearful reflections, and, for the present, we will not pursue 
them. 
Now to play the hypocrite, and endeavour to look composed and serene to my
mother, and to Flora, while my heart is breaking."

     The two friends had by this time reached the hall, and leaving his 
friend
Marchdale, Henry Bannerworth, with feelings of the most unenviable
description, slowly made his way to the apartment occupied by his mother and
sister.

 Next Time: The Old Admiral and his Servant. -- The Communication from the
 Landlord of the Nelson's Arms.



                                  Chapter XV.

THE OLD ADMIRAL AND HIS SERVANT. -- THE COMMUNICATION FROM THE LANDLORD OF 
THE
NELSON'S ARMS.

     While those matters of most grave and serious import were going on at 
the
Hall, while each day, and almost each hour in each day, was producing more 
and
more conclusive evidence upon a matter which at first had seemed too 
monstrous
to be at all credited, it may well be supposed what a wonderful sensation 
was
produced among the gossip-mongers of the neighbourhood by the exaggerated
reports that had reached them.

     The servants, who had left the Hall on no other account, as they 
declare,
but sheer fright at the awful visits of the vampyre, spread the news far and
wide, so that in the adjoining villages and market-towns the vampyre of
Bannerworth Hall became quite a staple article of conversation.

     Such a positive godsend for the lovers of the marvellous had not 
appeared
in the country side within the memory of that sapient individual -- the 
oldest
inhabitant.

     And, moreover, there was one thing which staggered some people of 
better
education and maturer judgments, and that was, that the more they took pains
to inquire into the matter, in order, if possible, to put an end to what 
they
considered a gross lie from the commencement, the more evidence they found 
to
stagger their own senses upon the subject.

     Everywhere then, in every house, public as well as private, something 
was
being continually said of the vampyre.  Nursery maids began to think a 
vampyre
vastly superior to "old scratch and old bogie" as a means of terrifying 
their
infant charges into quietness, if not to sleep, until they themselves became
too much afraid upon the subject to mention it.

     But nowhere was gossiping carried on upon the subject with more
systematic fervour than at an inn called the Nelson's Arms, which was in the
high street of the nearest market town to the Hall.

     There, it seemed as if the lovers of the horrible made a point of 
holding
their head quarters, and so thirsty did the numerous discussions make the
guests, that the landlord was heard to declare that he, from his heart, 
really
considered a vampyre as very nearly equal to a contested election.

     It was towards evening on the same day that Marchdale and Henry made
their visit to Sir Francis Varney, that a postchaise drew up to the inn we
have mentioned.  In the vehicle were two persons of exceedingly dissimilar
appearance and general aspect.

     One of these people was a man who seemed fast verging upon seventy 
years
of age, although, from his still ruddy and embrowned complexion and 
stentorian
voice, it was quite evident he intended yet to keep time at arm's-length for
many years to come.

     He was attired in ample and expensive clothing, but every article had a
naval animus about it, if we may be allowed such an expression with regard 
to
clothing.  On his buttons was an anchor, and the general assortment and 
colour
of the clothing as nearly assimilated as possible to the undress naval 
uniform
of an officer of high rank some fifty or sixty years ago.

     His companion was a younger man, and about his appearance there was no
secret at all.  He was a genuine sailor, and he wore the shore costume of 
one.
He was hearty-looking, and well dressed, and evidently well fed.

     As the chaise drove up to the door of the inn, this man made an
observation to the other to the following effect, --

     "A-hoy!"

     "Well, you lubber, what now?" cried the other.

     "They call this the Nelson's Arms; and you know, shiver me, that for 
the
best half of his life he had but one."

     "D--n you!" was the only rejoinder he got for his observation; but, 
with
that, he seemed very well satisfied.

     "Heave to!" he then shouted to the postillion, who was about to drive 
the
chaise into the yard.  "Heave to, you lubberly son of a gun! we don't want 
to
go into the dock."

     "Ah!" said the old man, "let's get out, Jack.  This is the port; and, 
do
you hear, and be cursed to you, let's have no swearing, d--n you, nor bad
language, you lazy swab."

     "Aye, aye," cried Jack; "I've not been ashore now a matter o' ten 
years,
and not larnt a little shore-going politeness, admiral, I ain't been your
_walley de sham_ without larning a little about land reckonings.  Nobody 
would
take me for a sailor now, I'm thinking, admiral."

     "Hold your noise!"

     "Aye, aye, sir."

     Jack, as he was called, bundled out of the chaise when the door was
opened, with a movement so closely resembling what would have ensued had he
been dragged out by the collar, that one was tempted almost to believe that
such a feat must have been accomplished by some invisible agency.

     He then assisted the old gentleman to alight, and the landlord of the 
inn
commenced the usual profusion of bows with which a passenger by a postchaise
is usually welcomed in preference to one by a stage coach.

     "Be quiet, will you!" shouted the admiral, for such indeed he was.  "Be
quiet."

     "Best accommodations, sir -- good wine -- well-aired beds -- good
attendance -- fine air -- "

     "Belay there," said Jack; and he gave the landlord what he considered a
gentle admonition, but which consisted of such a dig in the ribs, that he 
made
as many evolutions as the clown in a pantomime when he vociferated hot
codlings.

     "Now, Jack, where's the sailing instructions?" said his master.

     "Here, sir, in the locker," said Jack, as he took from his pocket a
letter, which he handed to the admiral.

     "Won't you step in, sir?" said the landlord, who had begun now to 
recover
a little from the dig in the ribs.

     "What's the use of coming into port and paying harbour dues, and all 
that
sort of thing, till we know if it's the right, you lubber, eh?"

     "No; oh, dear me, sir, of course -- God bless me, what can the old
gentleman mean?"

     The admiral opened the letter, and read: --

     "If you stop at the Nelson's Arms at Uxotter, you will hear of me, and 
I
can be sent for, when I will tell you more.

     "Yours, very obediently and humbly,

          "JOSIAH CRINKLES."

     "Who the deuce is he?"

     "This is Uxotter, sir," said the landlord; "and here you are, sir, at 
the
Nelson's Arms.  Good beds -- good wine -- good -- "

     "Silence!"

     "Yes, sir, -- oh, of course."

     "Who the devil is Josiah Crinkles?"

     "Ha! ha! ha! ha!  Makes me laugh, sir.  Who the devil indeed!  They do
say the devil and lawyers, sir, know something of each other -- makes me
smile."

     "I'll make you smile out of the other side of that d----d great 
hatchway
of a mouth of yours in a minute.  Who is Crinkles?"

     "Oh, Mr. Crinkles, sir, everybody knows.  A most respectable attorney,
sir, indeed, a highly respectable man, sir."

     "A lawyer?"

     "Yes, sir, a lawyer."

     "Well, I'm d----d!"

     Jack gave a long whistle, and both master and man looked at each other
aghast.

     "Now, hang me!" cried the admiral, "if ever I was so taken in all my
life."

     "Ay, ay, sir," said Jack.

     "To come a hundred and seventy miles to see a d----d swab of a rascally
lawyer."

     "Ay, ay, sir."

     "I'll smash him -- Jack!"

     "Yer honour?"

     "Get into the chaise again."

     "Well, but where's Master Charles?  Lawyers, in course, sir, is all
blessed rogues; but howsomedever, he may have for once in his life this here
one of 'em have told us of the right channel, and if so be as he has, don't 
be
the Yankee to leave him among the pirates.  I'm ashamed of you."

     "You infernal scoundrel; how dare you preach to me in such a way, you
lubberly rascal?"

     "Cos you desarves it."

     "Mutiny -- mutiny -- by Jove!  Jack, I'll have you put in irons -- 
you're
a scoundrel, and no seaman."

     "No seaman! -- no seaman!"

     "Not a bit of one."

     "Very good.  It's time, then, as I was off the purser's books.  Good 
bye
to you; I only hopes as you may get a better seaman to stick to you and be
your _walley de sham_ nor Jack Pringle, that's all the harm I wish you.  You
didn't call me no seaman in the Bay of Corfu, when the bullets were 
scuttling
our nobs."

     "Jack, you rascal, give us your fin.  Come here, you d----d villain. 
You'll leave me, will you?"

     "Not if I know it."

     "Come in, then."

     "Don't tell me I'm no seaman.  Call me a wagabone if you like, but 
don't
hurt my feelins.  There I'm as tender as a baby, I am. -- Don't do it."

     "Confound you, who is doing it?"

     "The devil."

     "Who is?"

     "Don't, then."

     Thus wrangling, they entered the inn, to the great amusement of several
bystanders, who had collected to hear the altercation between them.

     "Would you like a private room, sir?" said the landlord.

     "What's that to you?" said Jack.

     "Hold your noise, will you?" cried his master.  "Yes, I should like a
private room, and some grog."

     "Strong as the devil!" put in Jack.

     "Yes, sir -- yes, sir.  Good wines -- good beds -- good -- "

     "You said all that before, you know," remarked Jack, as he bestowed 
upon
the landlord another terrific dig in the ribs.

     "Hilloa!" cried the admiral, "you can send for that infernal lawyer,
Mister Landlord."

     "Mr. Crinkles, sir?"

     "Yes, yes."

     "Who may I have the honour to say, sir, wants to see him?"

     "Admiral Bell."

     "Certainly, admiral, certainly.  You'll find him a very conversible,
nice, gentlemanly little man, sir."

     "And tell him Jack Pringle is here, too," cried the seaman.

     "Oh, yes, yes -- of course," said the landlord, who was in such a state
of confusion from the digs in the ribs he had received, and the noise his
guests had already made in his house, that, had he been suddenly put upon 
his
oath, he would scarcely have liked to say which was the master and which was
the man.

     "The idea, now, Jack," said the admiral, "of coming all this way to see 
a
lawyer."

     "Ay, ay, sir."

     "If he's said he was a lawyer, we would have known what to do.  But 
it's
a take in, Jack."

     "So I think.  Howsomedever, we'll serve him out when we catch him, you
know."

     "Good -- so we will."

     "And, then, again, he may know something about Master Charles, sir, you
know.  Lord love him, don't you remember when he came aboard to see you once
at Portsmouth?"

     "Ah!  I do indeed."

     "And how he said he hated the French, and quite a baby, too. What
perseverance and sense.  'Uncle,' says he to you, 'when I'm a big man, I'll 
go
in a ship, and fight all the French in a heap,' says he.  'And beat 'em, my
boy, too,' says you; cos you thought he'd forgot that; and then he says,
'what's the use of saying that, stupid? -- don't we always beat 'em?'"

     The admiral laughed and rubbed his hands, as he cried aloud, --

     "I remember, Jack -- I remember him.  I was stupid to make such a
remark."

     "I know you was -- a d----d old fool I thought you."

     "Come, come.  Hilloa, there!"

     "Well, then, what do you call me no seaman for?"

     "Why, Jack, you bear malice like a marine."

     "There you go again.  Good bye.  Do you remember when we were yard arm 
to
yard arm with those two Yankee frigates, and took 'em both?  You didn't call
me a marine then, when the scuppers were running with blood.  Was I a seaman
then?"

     "You were, Jack -- you were; and you saved my life."

     "I didn't."

     "You did."

     "I say I didn't -- it was a marline-spike."

     "But I say you did, you rascally scoundrel.  I say you did, and I won't
be contradicted in my own ship."

     "Call this your ship?"

     "No, d--n it, -- I -- "

     "Mr. Crinkles," said the landlord, flinging the door wide open, and so 
at
once putting an end to the discussion which always apparently had a tendency
to wax exceedingly warm.

     "The shark, by G-d!" said Jack.

     A little, neatly dressed man made his appearance, and advanced rather
timidly into the room.  Perhaps he had heard from the landlord that the
parties who had sent for him were of rather a violent sort.

     "So you are Crinkles, are you?" cried the admiral.  "Sit down, though 
you
are a lawyer."

     "Thank you, sir.  I am an attorney, certainly and my name is certainly
Crinkles."

     "Look at that."

     The admiral placed the letter in the little lawyer's hands, who said, -
-

     "Am I to read it?"

     "Yes, to be sure."

     "Aloud?"

     "Read it to the devil, of you like, in a pig's whisper, or a West India
hurricane."

     "Oh, very good, sir.  I -- I am willing to be agreeable, so I'll read 
it
aloud, if it's all the same to you."

     He then opened the letter and read as follows: --

     "To Admiral Bell.

     "Admiral, -- Being, from various circumstances, aware that you take a
warm and a praiseworthy interest in your nephew Charles Holland, I venture 
to
write to you concerning a matter in which your immediate and active co-
operation with others may rescue him from a condition which will prove, if
allowed to continue, very much to his detriment, and ultimate unhappiness.

     "You are, then, hereby informed, that he, Charles Holland, has, much
earlier than he ought to have done, returned to England, and that the object
of his return is to contract a marriage into a family in every way
objectionable, and with a girl who is highly objectionable.

     "You, admiral, are his nearest and almost his only relative in the 
world;
you are the guardian of his property, and, therefore, it becomes a duty on
your part to interfere to save him from the ruinous consequences of a
marriage, which is sure to bring ruin and distress upon himself and all who
take an interest in his welfare.

     "The family he wishes to marry into is named Bannerworth, and the young
lady's name is Flora Bannerworth.  When, however, I inform you that a
_vampyre_ is in that family, and that if he married into it, he marries a
vampyre, and will have vampyres for children, I trust I have said enough to
warn you upon the subject, and to induce you to lose no time in repairing to
the spot.

     "If you stop at the Nelson's Arms in Uxotter, you will hear of me.  I 
can
be sent for, when I will tell you more.

     "Yours, very obediently and humbly,

                                        "JOSIAH CRINKLES."

     P.S. I enclose you Dr. Johnson's definition of a vampyre, which is as
follows:

     "VAMPYRE (a German blood-sucker) -- by which you perceive how many
vampyres, from time immemorial, must have been well entertained at the 
expense
of John Bull, at the court of St. James, where nothing hardly is to be met
with but German blood-suckers."

                        *              *               *

     The lawyer ceased to read, and the amazed look with which he glanced at
the face of Admiral Bell would, under any other circumstances, have much
amused him.  His mind, however, was by far too much engrossed with a
consideration of the danger of Charles Holland, his nephew, to be amused at
anything; so, when he found that the little lawyer said nothing, he bellowed
out, --

     "Well, sir?"

     "We-we-well," said the attorney.

     "I've sent for you, and here you are, and here I am, and here's Jack
Pringle.  What have you got to say?"

     "Just this much," said Mr. Crinkles, recovering himself a little, "just
this much, sir, that I never saw that letter before in all my life."

     "You -- never -- saw -- it?"

     "Never."

     "Didn't write it?"

     "On my solemn word of honour, sir, I did not."

     Jack Pringle whistled, and the admiral looked puzzled.  Like the 
admiral
in the song, too, he "grew paler," and then Mr. Crinkles added, --

     "Who has forged my name to a letter such as this, I cannot imagine.  As
for writing to you, sir, I never heard of your existence, except publicly, 
as
one of those gallant officers who have spent a long life in nobly fighting
their country's battles, and who are entitled to the admiration and the
applause of every Englishman."

     Jack and the admiral looked at each other in amazement, and then the
latter exclaimed, --

     "What!  This from a lawyer?"

     "A lawyer, sir," said Crinkles, "may know how to appreciate the deeds 
of
gallant men, although he many not be able to imitate them.  That letter, 
sir,
is a forgery, and I now leave you, only much gratified at the incident which
has procured me the honour of an interview with a gentleman, whose name will
live in the history of his country.  Good day, sir!  Good day!"

     "No.  I'm d----d if you go like that," said Jack, as he sprang to the
door, and put his back against it.  "You shall take a glass with me in 
honour
of the wooden walls of Old England, d---e, if you was twenty lawyers."

     "That's right, Jack," said the admiral.  "Come, Mr. Crinkles, I'll 
think,
for your sake, there may be two decent lawyers in the world, and you one of
them.  We must have a bottle of the best wine the ship -- I mean the house -
-
can afford together."

     "If it is your command, admiral, I obey with pleasure," said the
attorney; "and although I assure you, on my honour, I did not write that
letter, yet some of the matters mentioned in it are so generally notorious
here, that I can afford you some information concerning them."

     "Can you?"

     "I regret to say I can, for I respect the parties."

     "Sit down, then -- sit down. Jack, run to the steward's room and get 
the
wine.  We will go into it now starboard and larboard. Who the deuce could 
have
written that letter?"

     "I have not the least idea, sir."

     "Well -- well, never mind; it has brought me here, that's something, so 
I
won't grumble much at it.  I didn't know my nephew was in England, and I 
dare
say he didn't know I was; but here we both are, and I won't rest till I've
seen him, and ascertained how the what's-its-name --"

     "The vampyre."

     "Ah! the vampyre."

     "Shiver my timbers!" said Jack Pringle, who now brought in some wine 
much
against the remonstrances of the waiters of the establishment, who 
considered
that he was treading upon their vested interests by so doing.  -- "Shiver my
timbers, if I knows what a _wamphigher_ is, unless he's some distant 
relation
to Davy Jones!"

     "Hold your ignorant tongue," said the admiral; "nobody wants you to 
make
a remark, you great lubber!"

     "Very good," said Jack, and he sat down the wine on the table, and then
retired to the other end of the room, remarking to himself that he was not
called a great lubber on a certain occasion, when bullets were scuttling 
their
nobs, and they were yard arm to yard arm with God knows who.

     "Now, mister lawyer," said Admiral Bell, who had about him a large 
share
of the habits of a rough sailor.  "Now, mister lawyer, here is a glass first
to our better acquaintance, for d---e, if I don't like you!"

     "You are very good, sir."

     "Not at all.  There was a time, when I'd just as soon have thought of
asking a young shark to supper with me in my own cabin as a lawyer, but I
begin to see that there may be such a thing as a decent, good sort of fellow
seen in the law; so here's good luck to you, and you shall never want a 
friend
or a bottle while Admiral Bell has a shot in the locker."

     "Gammon," said Jack.

     "D--n you, what do you mean by that?" roared the admiral, in a furious
tone.

     "I wasn't speaking to you," shouted Jack, about two octaves higher.  
It's
two boys in the street as is pretending they're a going to fight, and I know 
d-
----d well they won't."

     "Hold your noise."

     "I'm going.  I wasn't told to hold my noise, when our nobs were being
scuttled off Beyrout."

     "Never mind him, mister lawyer," added the admiral.  "He don't know 
what
he's talking about.  Never mind him.  You go on and tell me all you know 
about
the -- the -- "

     "The vampyre!"

     "Ah!  I always forget the names of strange fish.  I suppose, after all,
it's something of the mermaid order?"

     "That I cannot say, sir; but certainly the story, in all its painful
particulars, has made a great sensation all over the country."

     "Indeed!"

     "Yes, sir.  You shall hear how it occurred.  It appears that one night
Miss Flora Bannerworth, a young lady of great beauty, and respected and
admired by all who knew her was visited by a strange being who came in at 
the
window."

     "My eye," said Jack, "if it waren't me, I wish it had a been."

     "So petrified by fear was she, that she had only time to creep half out
of the bed, and to utter one cry of alarm, when the strange visitor seized 
her
in his grasp."

     "D--n my pig tail," said Jack, "what a squall there must have been, to 
be
sure."

     "Do you see this bottle?" roared the admiral.

     "To be sure, I does; I think as it's time I seed another."

     "You scoundrel, I'll make you feel it against that d----d stupid head 
of
yours, if your interrupt this gentleman again."

     "Don't be violent."

     "Well, as I was saying," continued the attorney, "she did, by great 
good
fortune, manage to scream, which had the effect of alarming the whole house. 
The door of her chamber, which was fast, was broken open."

     "Yes, yes -- "

     "Ah," cried Jack.

     "You may imagine the horror and the consternation of those who entered
the room to find her in the grasp of a fiend-like figure, whose teeth were
fastened on her neck and who was actually draining her veins of blood."

     "The devil!"

     "Before any one could lay hands sufficiently upon the figure to detain
it, it had fled precipitately from its dreadful repast. Shots were fired 
after
it in vain."

     "And they let it go?"

     "They followed it, I understand, as well as they were able, and saw it
scale the garden wall of the premises; there it escaped, leaving, as you may
well imagine, on all their minds, a sensation of horror difficult to
describe."

     "Well, I never did hear anything the equal of that.  Jack, what do you
think of it?"

     "I haven't begun to think, yet," said Jack.

     "But what about my nephew, Charles?" added the admiral.

     "Of him I know nothing."

     "Nothing?"

     "Not a word, admiral.  I was not aware you had a nephew, or that any
gentleman bearing that, or any other relationship to you, had any sort of
connexion with these mysterious and most unaccountable circumstances.  I 
tell
you all I have gathered from common report about this vampyre business. 
Further I know not, I assure you."

     "Well, a man can't tell what he don't know.  It puzzles me to think who
could possibly have written me this letter."

     "That I am completely at a loss to imagine," said Crinkles. "I assure
you, my gallant sir, that I am much hurt at the circumstance of any one 
using
my name in such a way.  But, nevertheless, as you are here, permit me to 
say,
that it will be my pride, my pleasure, and the boast of the remainder of my
existence, to be of some service to so gallant a defender of my country, and
one whose name, along with the memory of his deeds, is engraved upon the 
heart
of every Briton."

     "Quite ekal to a book, he talks," said Jack.  "I never could read one
myself, on account o' not knowing how, but I've heard 'em read, and that's
just the sort o' incomprehensible gammon."

     "We don't want any of your ignorant remarks," said the admiral, "so you
be quiet."

     "Ay, ay, sir."

     "Now, Mister Lawyer, you are an honest fellow, and an honest fellow is
generally a sensible fellow."

     "Sir, I thank you."

     "If so be as what this letter says it true, my nephew Charles has got a
liking for this girl, who has had her neck bitten by a vampyre, you see."

     "I perceive, sir."

     "Now what would you do?"

     "One of the most difficult, as well, perhaps, as one of the most
ungracious of tasks," said the attorney, "is to interfere with family 
affairs.
The cold and steady eye of reason generally sees things in such very 
different
lights to what they appear to those whose feelings and whose affections are
much compromised in their results."

     "Very true.  Go on."

     "Taking, my dear sir, what in my humble judgment appears a reasonable
view of this subject, I should say it would be a dreadful thing for your
nephew to marry into a family any member of which was liable to the
visitations of a vampyre."

     "It wouldn't be pleasant."

     "The young lady might have children."

     "Oh, lots," cried Jack.

     "Hold your noise, Jack."

     "Ay, ay, sir."

     "And she might herself actually, when after death she became a vampyre,
come and feed on her own children."

     "Become a vampyre!  What, is she going to be a vampyre too?"

     "My dear sir, don't you know that it is a remarkable fact, as regards 
the
physiology of vampyres, that whoever is bitten by one of these dreadful
beings, becomes a vampyre?"

     "The devil!"

     "It is a fact, sir."

     "Whew!" whistled Jack; "she might bite us all, and we should be a whole
ship's crew o' _wamphigaers_.  There would be a confounded go!"

     "It's not pleasant," said the admiral, as he rose from his chair, and
paced to and fro in the room, "it's not pleasant. Hang me up at my own yard-
arm if it is."

     "Who said it was?" cried Jack.

     "Who asked you, you brute?"

     "Well, sir," added Mr. Crinkles, "I have given you all the information 
I
can; and I can only repeat what I before had the honour of saying more at
large, namely, that I am your humble servant to command, and that I shall be
happy to attend upon you at any time."

     "Thank ye -- thank ye, Mr. -- a  -- a -- "

     "Crinkles."

     "Ah, Crinkles.  You shall hear from me again, sir, shortly. Now that I 
am
down here, I will see to the very bottom of this affair, were it deeper than
fathom ever sounded.  Charles Holland was my poor sister's son; he's the 
only
relative I have in the wide world, and his happiness is dearer to my heart
than my own."

     Crinkles turned aside, and, by the twinkle of his eyes, one might 
premise
that the honest little lawyer was much affected.

     "God bless you, sir," he said; "farewell."

     "Good day to you."

     "Good-bye, lawyer," cried Jack.  "Mind how you go.  D--n me, if you 
don't
seem a decent sort of fellow, and, after all, you may give the devil a clear
berth, and get into heaven's straits, with a flowing sheet, provided you
don't, towards the end of the voyage, make any lubberly blunders."

     The old admiral threw himself into a chair with a deep sigh.

     "Jack," said he.

     "Aye, aye, sir."

     "What's to be done now?"

     Jack opened the window to discharge the superfluous moisture from an
enormous quid he had indulged himself with while the lawyer was telling 
about
the vampyre, and then again turning his face towards his master, he said, --

     "Do?  What shall we do?  Why, go at once and find out Charles, our
_nevy_, and ask him all about it, and see the young lady, too, and lay hold 
o'
the _wamphigher_ if we can, as well, and go at the whole affair broadside to
broadside, till we make a prize of all the particulars, arter which we can
turn it over in our minds agin, and see what's to be done."

     "Jack, you are right.  Come along."

     "I knows I am.  Do you know now which way to steer?"

     "Of course not.  I never was in this latitude before, and the channel
looks intricate.  We will hail a pilot, Jack, and then we shall be all 
right,
and if we strike it will be his fault."

     "Which is a mighty great consolation," said Jack.  "Come along."

--
 The Sudden Appearance of Sir Francis Varney.




                                 CHAPTER XX.

THE DREADFUL MISTAKE. -- THE TERRIFIC INTERVIEW IN THE CHAMBER. -- THE 
ATTACK
OF THE VAMPYRE.


     The footstep which Flora, upon the close of the tale she had been
reading, heard approaching her apartment, came rapidly along the corridor.

     "It is Henry, returned to conduct me to an interview  with Charles's
uncle," she said.  "I wonder, now, what manner of man he is.  He should in
some respect resemble Charles; and if he do so, I shall bestow upon him some
affection for that alone."

     Tap -- tap came upon the chamber door.

     Flora was not at all alarmed now, as she had been when Henry brought 
her
the manuscript.  From some strange action of the nervous system, she felt
quite confident, and resolved to brave everything.  But then she felt quite
sure that it was Henry, and before the knocking had taken her by surprise.

     "Come in," she said, in a cheerful voice.  "Come in."

     The door opened with wonderful swiftness -- a figure stepped into the
room, and then closed it as rapidly, and stood against it.  Flora tried to
scream, but her tongue refused its office; a confused whirl of sensations
passed through her brain -- she trembled, and an icy coldness came over her. 
It was Sir Francis Varney, the vampyre!

     He had drawn up his tall, gaunt frame to its full height, and crossed 
his
arms upon his breast; there was a hideous smile upon his sallow countenance,
and his voice was deep and sepulchral, as he said, --

     "Flora Bannerworth, hear that which I have to say, and hear it calmly. 
You need have nothing to fear.  Make an alarm-- scream, or shout for help,
and, by the hell beneath us, you are lost!"

     There was a death-like, cold, passionless manner about the utterance of
these words, as if they were spoken mechanically, and came from no human 
lips.

     Flora heard them, and yet scarcely comprehended them; she stepped 
slowly
back till she reached a chair, and there she held for support.  The only 
part
of the address of Varney that thoroughly reached her ears, was that if she
gave any alarm some dreadful consequences were to ensue.  But it was not on
account of these words that she really gave no alarm; it was because she was
utterly unable to do so.

     "Answer me," said Varney.  "Promise that you will hear that which I 
have
to say.  In so promising you commit yourself to no evil, and you shall hear
that which shall give you much peace."

     It was in vain she tried to speak; her lips moved, but she uttered no
sound.

     "You are terrified," said Varney, "and yet I know not why. I do not 
come
to do you harm, although harm have you done me. Girl, I come to rescue you
from a thraldom of the soul under which you now labour."

     There was a pause of some moments' duration, and then, faintly, Flora
managed to say, --

     "Help! help!  Oh, help me, Heaven!"

     Varney made a gesture of impatience, as he said, --

     "Heaven works no special matters now.  Flora Bannerworth, if you have 
as
much intellect as your nobility and beauty would warrant the world in
supposing, you will listen to me."

     "I-- I hear," said Flora, as she still, dragging the chair with her,
increased the distance between them.

     "'Tis well.  You are now more composed."

     She fixed her eyes upon the face of Varney with a shudder. There could 
be
no mistake.  It was the same which, with the strange, glassy looking eyes, 
had
glared upon her on that awful night of the storm, when she was visited by 
the
vampyre.  And Varney returned that gaze unflinchingly.  There was a hideous
and strange contortion of his face now as he said, --

     "You are beautiful.  The most cunning statuary might well model some 
rare
work of art from those rounded limbs, that were surely made to bewitch the
gazer.  Your skin rivals the driven snow-- what a face of loveliness, and
what a form of enchantment."

     She did not speak, but a thought came across her mind, which at once
crimsoned her cheek -- she knew she had fainted on the first visit of the
vampyre, and now he, with a hideous reverence, praised beauties which he 
might
have cast his demonic eyes over at such a time.

     "You understand me," he said.  "Well, let that pass.  I am something
allied to humanity yet."

     "Speak your errand," gasped Flora, "or come what may, I scream for help
to those who will not be slow to render it."

     "I know it."

     "You know I will scream?"

     "No; you will hear me.  I know they would not be slow to render help to
you, but you will not call for it; I will present to you no necessity."

     "Say on-- say on."

     "You perceive I do not attempt to approach you; my errand is one of
peace."

     "Peace from you!  Horrible being, if you be really what even now my
appalled imagination shrinks from naming you, would not even to you absolute
annihilation be a blessing?"

     "Peace, peace.  I came not here to talk on such a subject. I must be
brief, Flora Bannerworth, for time presses.  I do not hate you.  Wherefore
should I?  You are young, and you are beautiful, and you bear a name which
should command, and does command, some portion of my best regard."

     "There is a portrait," said Flora, "in this house."

     "No more-- no more.  I know what you would say."

     "It is yours."

     "The house, and all within, I covet," he said, uneasily. "Let that
suffice.  I have quarrelled with your brother-- I have quarrelled with one
who just now fancies he loves you."

     "Charles Holland loves me truly."

     "It does not suit me now to dispute that point with you.  I have the
means of knowing more of the secrets of the human heart than common men.  I
tell you, Flora Bannerworth, that he who talks to you of love, loves you not
but with the fleeting fancy of a boy; and there is one who hides deep in his
heart a world of passion, one who has never spoken to you of love, and yet 
who
loves you with a love as afar surpassing the evanescent fancy of this boy
Holland, as does the mighty ocean the most placid lake that ever basked in
idleness beneath a summer's sun."

     There was a wonderful fascination in the manner now of Varney.  His 
voice
sounded like music itself.  His words flowed from his tongue, each gently 
and
properly accented, with all the charm of eloquence.

     Despite her trembling horror of that man -- despite her fearful 
opinion,
which might be said to amount to a conviction of what he really was, Flora
felt an irresistible wish to hear him speak on.  Ay, despite, too, the
ungrateful theme to her heart which he had now chosen as the subject of his
discourse, she felt her fear of him gradually dissipating, and now when he
made a pause, she said, --

     "You are much mistaken.  On the constancy and truth of Charles Holland, 
I
would stake my life."

     "No doubt, no doubt."

     "Have you spoken now that which you had to say?"

     "No, no.  I tell you I covet this place, I would purchase it, but 
having
with your bad-tempered brothers quarrelled, they will hold no further 
converse
with me."

     "And well they may refuse."

     "Be that as it may, sweet lady, I come to you to be my mediator.  In 
the
shadows of the future I can see many events which are to come."

     "Indeed."

     "It is so.  Borrowing some wisdom from the past, and some from 
resources
I would not detail to you, I know that if I have inflicted much misery upon
you, I can spare you much more.  Your brother or your lover will challenge
me."

     "Oh, no, no."

     "I say such will happen, and I can kill either.  My skill as well as my
strength is superhuman."

     "Mercy! mercy!" gasped Flora.

     "I will spare either or both on a condition."

     "What fearful condition?"

     "It is not a fearful one.  Your terrors go far beyond the fact.  All I
wish, maiden, of you is to induce these imperious brothers of yours to sell 
or
let the Hall to me."

     "Is that all?"

     "It is.  I ask no more, and, in return, I promise you not only that I
will not fight with them, but that you shall never see me again.  Rest
securely, maiden, you will be undisturbed by me."

     "Oh, God! that were indeed an assurance worth the striving for," said
Flora.

     "It is one you may have.  But-- "

     "Oh, I knew-- my heart told me there was yet some fearful condition to
come."

     "You are wrong again.  I only ask of you that you keep this meeting a
secret."

     "No, no, no-- I cannot."

     "Nay, what so easy?"

     "I will not; I have no secrets from those I love."

     "Indeed, you will find soon the expediency of a few at least; but if 
you
will not, I cannot urge it longer.  Do as your wayward woman's nature 
prompts
you."

     There was a slight, but a very slight, tone of aggravation in these
words, and the manner in which they were uttered.

     As he spoke, he moved from the door towards the window, which opened 
into
a kitchen garden.  Flora shrunk as far from him as possible, and for a few
minutes they regarded each other in silence.

     "Young blood," said Varney, "mantles in your veins."

     She shuddered with terror.

     "Be mindful of the condition I have proposed to you.  I covet 
Bannerworth
Hall."

     "I-- I hear."

     "And I must have it.  I will have it, although my path to it be through 
a
sea of blood.  You understand me, maiden?  Repeat what has passed between us
or not, as you please.  I say, beware of me, if you keep not the condition I
have proposed."

     "Heaven knows that this place is becoming daily more hateful to us 
all,"
said Flora.

     "Indeed!"

     "You well might know so much.  It is no sacrifice to urge it now.  I 
will
urge my brothers."

     "Thanks-- a thousand thanks.  You many not live to regret having made a
friend of Varney-- "

     "The vampyre!" said Flora.

     He advanced towards her a step, and she involuntarily uttered a scream 
of
terror.

     In an instant his hand clasped her waist with the power of an iron 
vice;
she felt his hot breath flushing on her cheek.  Her senses reeled, and she
found herself sinking.  She gathered all her breath and all her energies 
into
one piercing shriek, and then she fell to the floor.  There was a sudden 
crash
of broken glass, and then all was still.

 Next Time: The Conference Between the Uncle and Nephew, and The Alarm.




                                Chapter XXI.

THE CONFERENCE BETWEEN THE UNCLE AND NEPHEW, AND THE ALARM.


     Meanwhile Charles Holland had taken his uncle by the arm, and led him
into a private room.

     "Dear uncle," he said, "be seated, and I will explain everything 
without
reserve."

     "Seated! -- nonsense!  I'll walk about," said the admiral. "D--n me! 
I've no patience to be seated, and very seldom had or have.  Go on now, you
young scamp."

     "Well-- well; you abuse me, but I am quite sure, had you been in my
situation, you would have acted precisely as I have done."

     "No, I shouldn't."

     "Well, but, uncle-- "

     "Don't think to come over me by calling me uncle.  Hark you, Charles--
from this moment I won't be your uncle any more."

     "Very well, sir."

     "It ain't very well.  And how dare you, you buccaneer, call me sir, eh? 
I say, how dare you?"

     "I will call you anything I like."

     "But I won't be called anything I like.  You might as well call me at
once Morgan the Pirate, for he was called anything he liked.  Hilloa, sir! 
how
dare you laugh, eh?  I'll teach you to laugh at me.  I wish I had you on 
board
ship-- that's all, you young rascal.  I'd soon teach you to laugh at your
superior officer, I would."

     "Oh, uncle, I did not laugh at you."

     "What did you laugh at, then?"

     "At the joke."

     "Joke.  D--n me, there was no joke at all!"

     "Oh, very good."

     "And it ain't very good."

     Charles knew very well that, this sort of humour, in which was the old
admiral, would soon pass away, and then that he would listen to him
comfortably enough; so he would not allow the least exhibition of petulance 
or
mere impatience to escape himself, but contented himself by waiting until 
the
ebullition of feeling fairly worked itself out.

     "Well, well," at length said the old man, "you have dragged me here, 
into
a very small and very dull room, under pretence of having something to tell
me, and I have heard nothing yet."

     "Then I will now tell you," said Charles.  "I fell in love-- "

     "Bah!"

     "With Flora Bannerworth, abroad; she is not only the most beautiful of
created beings-- "

     "Bah!"

     "But her mind is of the highest order of intelligence, honour, candour,
and all amiable feelings-- "

     "Bah!"

     "Really, uncle, if you say 'Bah!' to everything, I cannot go on."

     "And what the deuce difference, sir, does it make to you, whether I say
'Bah!' or not?"

     "Well, I love her.  She came to England, and, as I could not exist, but
was getting ill, and should, no doubt, have died if I had not done so, I 
came
to England."

     "But d---e, I want to know about the mermaid."

     "The vampyre, you mean, sir."

     "Well, well, the vampyre."

     "Then, uncle, all I can tell you is, that it is supposed a vampyre came
one night and inflicted a wound upon Flora's neck with his teeth, and that 
he
is still endeavouring to renew his horrible existence from the young, pure
blood that flows through her veins."

     "The devil he is!"

     "Yes.  I am bewildered, I must confess, by the mass of circumstances 
that
have combined to give the affair a horrible truthfulness.  Poor Flora is 
much
injured in health and spirits; and when I came home, she, at once, implored 
me
to give her up, and think of her no more, for she could not think of 
allowing
me to unite my fate with hers, under such circumstances."

     "She did?"

     "Such were her words, uncle.  She implored me-- she used the word
'implore' -- to fly from her, to leave her to her fate, to endeavour to find
happiness with some one else."

     "Well?"

     "But I saw her heart was breaking."

     "What o' that?"

     "Much of that, uncle.  I told her that when I deserted her in the hour 
of
misfortune that I hoped Heaven would desert me.  I told her that if her
happiness was wrecked, to cling yet to me, and that with what power and what
strength God had given me, I would stand between her and all ill."

     "And what then?"

     "She-- she fell upon my breast and wept and blessed me. Could I desert
her-- could I say to her, 'My dear girl, when you were full of health and
beauty, I loved you, but now that sadness is at your heart I leave you?' 
Could I tell her that, uncle, and yet call myself a man?"

     "No!" reared the old admiral, in a voice that made the room echo again;
"and I tell you what, if you had done so, d--n you, you puppy, I'd have 
braced
you, and-- and married the girl myself.  I would, d---e, but I would."

     "Dear uncle!"

     "Don't dear me, sir.  Talk of deserting a girl when the signal of
distress, in the shape of a tear, is in her eye?"

     "But I-- "

     "You are a wretch-- a confounded lubberly boy-- a swab-- a d----d bad
grampus."

     "You mistake, uncle."

     "No, I don't.  God bless you, Charles, you shall have her-- if a whole
ship's crew of vampyres said no, you shall have her.  Let me see her-- just
let me see her."

     The admiral gave his lips a vigorous wipe with his sleeve, and Charles
said hastily, --

     "My dear uncle, you will recollect that Miss Bannerworth is quite a 
young
lady."

     "I suppose she is."

     "Well, then, for God's sake, don't attempt to kiss her."

     "Not kiss her! d---e, they like it.  Not kiss her, because she's a 
young
lady!  D---e, do you think I'd kiss a corporal of marines?"

     "No, uncle; but you know young ladies are very delicate."

     "And ain't I delicate-- shiver my timbers, ain't I delicate?  Where is
she? that's what I want to know."

     "Then you approve of what I have done?"

     "You are a young scamp, but you have got some of the old admiral's 
family
blood in you, so don't take any credit for acting like an honest man-- you
couldn't help it."

     "But if I had not so acted, " said Charles, with a smile, "what would
have become of the family blood, then?"

     "What's that to you?  I would have disowned you, because that very 
thing
would have convinced me you were an impostor, and did not belong to the 
family
at all."

     "Well, that would have been one way of getting over the difficulty."

     "No difficulty at all.  The man who deserts the good ship that carries
him through the waves, or the girl that trusts her heart to him, ought to be
chopped up into meat for wild monkeys."

     "Well, I think so too."

     "Of course you do."

     "Why, of course?"

     "Because it's so d----d reasonable that, being a nephew of mine, you
can't possibly help it."

     "Bravo, uncle!  I had no idea you were so argumentative."

     "Hadn't you a spooney; you'd be an ornament to the gun-room, you would;
but where's the 'young lady' who is so infernal delicate-- where is she, I
say?"

     "I will fetch her, uncle."

     "Ah, do; I'll be bound, now, she's one of the right build-- a good
figure-head, and don't make too much stern-way."

     "Well, well, whatever you do, now don't pay her any compliments, for 
your
efforts in that line are of such a very doubtful order, that I shall dread 
to
hear you."

     "You be off, and mind your own business; I haven't been at sea forty
years without picking up some out-and-out delicate compliments to say to a
young lady."

     "But do you really imagine, now, that the deck of a man-of-war is a 
nice
place to pick up courtly compliments in?"

     "Of course I do.  There you hear the best of language, d---e!  You 
don't
know what you are talking about, you fellows that have stuck on shore all 
your
lives; it's we seamen who learn life."

     "Well, well-- hark!"

     "What's that?"

     "A cry-- did you not hear a cry?"

     "A signal of distress, by G-d!"

     In their efforts to leave the room, the uncle and nephew for about a
minute actually blocked up the door-way, but the superior bulk of the 
admiral
prevailed, and after nearly squeezing poor Charles flat, he got out first.

     But this did not avail him, for he knew not where to go. Now, the 
second
scream which Flora had uttered when the vampyre had clasped her waist came
upon their ears, and, as they were outside the room, it acted well as a 
guide
in which direction to come.

     Charles fancied correctly enough at once that it proceeded from the 
room
which was called "Flora's own room," and thither-ward accordingly he dashed 
at
tremendous speed.

     Henry, however, happened to be nearer at hand, and, moreover, he did 
not
hesitate a moment, because he knew that Flora was in her own room; so he
reached it first, and Charles saw him rush in a few moments before he could
reach the room.

     The difference of time, however, was very slight, and Henry had only 
just
raised Flora from the floor as Charles appeared.

     "God of Heaven!" cried the latter, "what has happened?"

     "I know not," said Henry; "as God is my judge, I know not. Flora, 
Flora,
speak to us!  Flora!  Flora!"

     "She has fainted!" cried Charles.  "Some water may restore her.  Oh,
Henry, Henry, is not this horrible?"

     "Courage! courage!" said Henry, although his voice betrayed what a
terrible state of anxiety he was himself in; "you will find water in that
decanter, Charles.  Here is my mother, too! Another visit!  God help us!"

     Mrs. Bannerworth sat down on the edge of the sofa which was in the 
room,
and could only wring her hands and weep.

     "Avast!" cried the admiral, making his appearance.  "Where's the enemy,
lads?"

     "Uncle," said Charles, "uncle, uncle, the vampyre has been here again--
the dreadful vampyre!"

     "D--n me, and he's gone, too, and carried half the window with him.  
Look
there!"

     It was literally true; the window, which was a long latticed one, was
smashed through.

     "Help! oh, help!" said Flora, as the water that was dashed in her face
began to recover her.

     "You are safe!" cried Henry, "you are safe!"

     "Flora," said Charles; "you know my voice, dear Flora?  Look up, and 
you
will see there are none here but those who love you."

     Flora opened her eyes timidly as she said, --

     "Has it gone?"

     "Yes, yes, dear," said Charles.  "Look around you; here are none but 
true
friends."

     "And tried friends, my dear," said Admiral Bell, "excepting me; and
whenever you like to try me, afloat or ashore, d--n me, shew me Old Nick
himself, and I won't shrink-- yard arm and yard arm-- grapnel to grapnel--
pitch pots and grenades!"

     "This is my uncle, Flora," said Charles.

     "I thank you, sir," said Flora, faintly.

     "All right!" whispered the admiral to Charles; "what a figure-head to 
be
sure!  Poll at Swansea would have made just about four of her, but she 
wasn't
so delicate, d--n me!"

     "I should think not."

     "You are right for once in a way, Charley."

     "What was it that alarmed you?" said Charles, tenderly, as he now took
one of Flora's hands in his.

     "Varney-- Varney, the vampyre."

     "Varney!" exclaimed Henry; "Varney here!"

     "Yes, he came in at that door; and when I screamed, I suppose-- for I
hardly was conscious-- he darted out through the window."

     "This," said Henry, "is beyond all human patience.  By Heaven! I cannot
and will not endure it."

     "It shall be my quarrel," said Charles; "I shall go at once and defy 
him.
He shall meet me."

     "Oh, no, no, no," said Flora, as she clung convulsively to Charles.  
"No,
no; there is a better way."

     "What way?"

     "The place has become full of terrors.  Let us leave it. Let him, as he
wishes, have it."

     "Let _him_ have it?"

     "Yes, yes, God knows, if it purchase an immunity from these visits, we
may well be overjoyed.  Remember that we have ample reasons to believe him
more than human.  Why should you allow yourselves to risk a personal 
encounter
with such a man, who might be glad to kill you that he might have an
opportunity of replenishing his own hideous existence from your best heart's
blood?"

     The young men looked aghast.

     "Besides," added Flora, "you cannot tell what dreadful powers of 
mischief
he may have, against which human courage might be of no avail."

     "There is truth and reason," said Mr. Marchdale, stepping forward, "in
what Flora says."

     "Only let me come across him, that's all," said Admiral Bell, "and I'll
soon find out what he is.  I suppose he's some long slab of a lubber after
all, ain't he, with no strength."

     "His strength is immense," said Marchdale.  "I tried to seize him, and 
I
fell beneath his arm as if I had been struck by the hammer of a Cyclops."

     "A what?" cried the admiral.

     "A Cyclops."

     "D--n me, I served aboard the Cyclops eleven years, and never saw a 
very
big hammer aboard of her."

     "What on earth is to be done?" said Henry.

     "Oh," chimed in the admiral, "there's always a bother about what's to 
be
done on earth.  Now, at sea, I could soon tell you what was to be done."

     "We must hold a solemn consultation over this matter," said Henry.  
"You
are safe now, Flora."

     "Oh, be ruled by me.  Give up the Hall."

     "You tremble."

     "I do tremble, brother, for what may yet ensue.  I implore you to give 
up
the Hall.  It is but a terror to us now-- give it up.  Have no more to do
with it.  Let us make terms with Sir Francis Varney.  Remember, we dare not
kill him."

     "He ought to be smothered," said the admiral.

     "It is true," remarked Henry, "we dare not, even holding all the 
terrible
suspicions we do, take his life."

     "By foul means certainly not," said Charles, "were he ten times a
vampyre.  I cannot, however, believe that he is so invulnerable as he is
represented."

     "No one represents him here," said Marchdale.  "I speak, sir, because I
saw you glance at me.  I only know that, having made two unsuccessful 
attempts
so to seize him, he eluded me, once by leaving in my grasp a piece of his
coat, and the next time he struck me down, and I feel yet the effects of the
terrific blow."

     "You hear?" said Flora.

     "Yes, I hear," said Charles.

     "For some reason," added Marchdale, in a tone of emotion, "what I say
seems to fall always badly upon Mr. Holland's ear.  I know not why; but if 
it
will give him any satisfaction, I will leave Bannerworth Hall to-night."

     "No, no, no," said Henry; "for the love of Heaven, do not let us
quarrel."

     "Hear, hear," cried the admiral.  "We can never fight the enemy well if
the ship's crew are on bad terms.  Come now, you Charles, this appears to be
an honest, gentlemanly  fellow-- give him your hand."

     "If Mr. Charles Holland," said Marchdale, "knows aught to my prejudice 
in
any way, however slight, I here beg of him to declare it at once, and 
openly."

     "I cannot assert that I do," said Charles.

     "Then what the deuce do you make yourself so disagreeable for, eh?" 
cried
the admiral.

     "One cannot help one's impression and feelings," said Charles; "but I 
am
willing to take Mr. Marchdale's hand."

     "And I yours, young sir," said Marchdale, "in all sincerity of spirit,
and with good will towards you."

     They shook hands; but it required no conjuror to perceive that it was 
not
done willingly or cordially.  It was a hand-shaking of that character which
seemed to imply on each side, "I don't like you, but I don't know positively
any harm of you."

     "There now," said the admiral, "that's better."

     "Now, let us hold counsel about this Varney," said Henry. "Come to the
parlour all of you, and we will endeavor to come to some decided 
arrangement."

     "Do not weep, mother," said Flora.  "All may yet be well. We will leave
this place."

     "We will consider that question, Flora," said Henry; "and believe me 
your
wishes will go a long way with all of us, as you may well suppose they 
always
would."

     They left Mrs. Bannerworth with Flora, and proceeded to the small oaken
parlour, in which were the elaborate and beautiful carvings which have been
before mentioned.

     Henry's countenance, perhaps, wore the most determined expression of 
all.
He appeared now as if he had thoroughly made up his mind to do something 
which
should have a decided tendency to put a stop to the terrible scenes which 
were
now day by day taking place beneath that roof.

     Charles Holland looked serious and thoughtful, as if he were revolving
some course of action in his mind concerning which he was not quite clear.

     Mr. Marchdale was more sad and depressed, to all appearance, than any 
of
them.

     As for the admiral, he was evidently in a state of amazement, and knew
not what to think.  He was anxious to do something, and yet what that was to
be he had not the most remote idea, any more than as if he was not at all
cognisant of any of those circumstances, every one of which was so 
completely
out of the line of his former life and experience.

     George had gone to call on Mr. Chillingworth, so he was not present at
the first part of this serious council of war.

                                Chapter XXII.

THE CONSULTATION. -- THE DETERMINATION TO LEAVE THE HALL.


     This was certainly the most seriously reasonable meeting which had been
held at Bannerworth Hall on the subject of the much dreaded vampyre.  The
absolute necessity for doing something of a decisive character was 
abundantly
apparent, and when Henry promised Flora that her earnest wish to leave the
house should not be forgotten as an element in the discussion which was 
about
to ensue, it was with a rapidly growing feeling on his own part, to the 
effect
that that house, associated even as it was with many endearing 
recollections,
was no home for him.

     Hence he was the more inclined to propose a departure from the Hall if 
it
could possibly be arranged satisfactorily in a pecuniary point of view.  The
pecuniary point of view, however, in which Henry was compelled to look at 
the
subject, was an important and a troublesome one.

     We have already hinted at the very peculiar state of the finances of 
the
family; and, in fact, although the income derivable from various sources 
ought
to have been amply sufficient to provide Henry, and those who were dependent
upon him, with a respectable livelihood, yet it was nearly all swallowed up 
by
the payment of regular instalments upon family debts incurred by his father. 
And the creditors took great credit to themselves that they allowed of such 
an
arrangement, instead of sweeping off all before them, and leaving the family
to starve.

     The question, therefore, or, at all events, one of the questions, now
was, how far would a departure from the Hall of him, Henry, and the other
branches of the family, act upon that arrangement?

     During a very few minutes' consideration, Henry, with the frank and
candid disposition which was so strong a characteristic of his character, 
made
up his mind to explain all this fully to Charles Holland and his uncle.

     When once he formed such a determination he was not likely to be slow 
in
carrying it into effect, and no sooner, then, were the whole of them seated 
in
the small oaken parlour than he made an explicit statement of his
circumstances.

     "But," said Mr. Marchdale, when he had done, "I cannot see what right
your creditors have to complain of where you live, so long as you perform 
your
contract to them."

     "True; but they always expected me, I know, to remain at the Hall, and 
if
they chose, why, of course, at any time, they could sell off the whole
property for what it would fetch, and pay themselves as far as the proceeds
would go. At all events, I am quite certain there could be nothing at all 
left
for me."

     "I cannot imagine," added Mr. Marchdale, "that any men could be so
unreasonable."

     "It is scarcely to be borne," remarked Charles Holland, with more
impatience than he usually displayed, "that a whole family are to be put to
the necessity of leaving their home for no other reason than the being
pestered by such a neighbour as Sir Francis Varney.  It makes one impatient
and angry to reflect upon such a state of things."

     "And yet they are lamentably true," said Henry.  "What can we do?"

     "Surely there must be some sort of remedy."

     "There is but one that I can imagine, and that is one we all alike 
revolt
from.  We might kill him."

     "That is out of the question."

     "Of course my impression is that he bears the same name really as 
myself,
and that he is my ancestor, from whom was painted the portrait on the 
panel."

     "Have circumstances really so far pressed upon you," said Charles
Holland, "as at length to convince you that this man is really the horrible
creature we surmise he may be?"

     "Dare we longer doubt it?" cried Henry, in a tone of excitement.  "He 
is
the vampyre."

     "I'll be hanged if I believe it," said Admiral Bell! "Stuff and 
nonsense!
Vampyre, indeed!  Bother the vampyre."

     "Sir," said Henry, "you have not had brought before you, painfully, as 
we
have, all the circumstances upon which we, in a manner, feel compelled to
found this horrible belief.  At first incredulity was a natural thing.  We 
had
no idea that ever we would be brought to believe in such a thing."

     "That is the case," added Marchdale.  "But, step by step, we have been
driven from utter disbelief in this phenomenon to a trembling conviction 
that
it must be true."

     "Unless we admit that, simultaneously, the senses of a number of 
persons
have been deceived."

     "That is scarcely possible."

     "Then do you mean really to say there are such fish?" said the admiral.

     "We think so."

     "Well, I'm d----d!  I have heard all sorts of yarns about what fellows
have seen in one ocean or another; but this does beat them all to nothing."

     "It is monstrous," exclaimed Charles.

     There was a pause of some few moments' duration, and then Mr. Marchdale
said, in a low voice, --

     "Perhaps I ought not to propose any course of action until you, Henry,
have yourself done so; but even at the risk of being presumptuous, I will 
say
that I am firmly of the opinion that you ought to leave the Hall."

     "I am inclined to think so, too," said Henry.

     "But the creditors?" interposed Charles.

     "I think they might be consulted on the matter beforehand," added
Marchdale, "when no doubt they would acquiesce in an arrangement which could
do them no harm."

     "Certainly, no harm," said Henry, "for I cannot take the estate with 
me,
as they well know."

     "Precisely.  If you do not like to sell it, you can let it."

     "To whom?"

     "Why, under the existing circumstances, it is not likely you would get
any tenant for it than the one who has offered himself."

     "Sir Francis Varney?"

     "Yes.  It seems to be a great object with him to live here, and it
appears to me, that notwithstanding all that has occurred, it is most
decidedly the best policy to let him."

     Nobody could really deny the reasonableness of this advice, although it
seemed strange, and was repugnant to the feelings of them all, as they heard
it.  There was a pause of some seconds' duration, and then Henry said, --

     "It does, indeed seem singular, to surrender one's house to such a
being."

     "Especially," said Charles, "after what has occurred."

     "True."

     "Well," said Mr. Marchdale, "if any better plan of proceeding, taking 
the
whole case into consideration, can be devised, I shall be most happy."

     "Will you consent to put off all proceedings for three days?" said
Charles Holland, suddenly.

     "Have you any plan, my dear sir?" said Mr. Marchdale.

     "I have, but it is one which I would rather say nothing about for the
present."

     "I have no objection," said Henry, "I do not know that three days can
make any difference in the state of affairs. Let it be so, if you wish,
Charles."

     "Then I am satisfied," said Charles.  "I cannot but feel that, situated
as I am regarding Flora, this is almost more my affair than even yours,
Henry."

     "I cannot see that," said Henry.  "Why should you take upon yourself 
more
of the responsibility of these affairs than I, Charles?  You induce in my 
mind
a suspicion that you have some desperate project in your imagination, which 
by
such a proposition you would seek to reconcile us to."

     Charles was silent, and Henry then added, --

     "Now, Charles, I am quite convinced that what I have hinted at is the
fact.  You have conceived some scheme which you fancy would be much opposed 
by
us?"

     "I will not deny that I have," said Charles.  "It is one, however, 
which
you must allow me for the present to keep locked in my own breast."

     "Why will you not trust us?"

     "For two reasons."

     "Indeed!"

     "The one is, that I have not yet thoroughly determined upon the course 
I
project; and the other is, that it is one in which I am not justified in
involving anyone else."

     "Charles, Charles," said Henry, despondingly; "only consider for a 
moment
into what new misery you may plunge poor Flora, who is, Heaven knows, 
already
sufficiently afflicted, by attempting an enterprise which even we, who are
your friends, may unwittingly cross you in the performance of."

     "This is one in which I fear no such result.  It cannot so happen.  Do
not urge me."

     "Can't you say at once what you think of doing?" said the old admiral. 
"What do you mean by turning your sails in all sorts of directions so oddly? 
You sneak, why don't you be what do you call it -- explicit?"

     "I cannot, uncle."

     "What, are you tongue-tied?"

     "All here know well," said Charles, "that if I do not unfold my mind
fully, it is not that I fear to trust any one present, but from some other
most special reason."

     "Charles, I forbear to urge you further," said Henry, "and only implore
you to be careful."

     At this moment the room door opened, and George Bannerworth, 
accompanied
by Mr. Chillingworth, came in.

     "Do not let me intrude," said the surgeon; "I fear, as I see you 
seated,
gentlemen, that my presence must be a rudeness and a disturbance to some
family consultation among yourselves?"

     "Not at all, Mr. Chillingworth," said Henry.  "Pray be seated; we are
very glad indeed to see you.  Admiral Bell, this is a friend on whom we can
rely -- Mr. Chillingworth."

     "And one of the right sort, I can see," said the admiral, as he shook 
Mr.
Chillingworth by the hand.

     "Sir, you do me much honour," said the doctor.

     "None at all, none at all; I suppose you know all about this infernal 
odd
vampyre business?"

     "I believe I do, sir."

     "And what do you think of it?"

     "I think time will develop the circumstances sufficiently to convince 
us
all that such things cannot be."

     "D--n me, you are the most sensible fellow, then, that I have yet met
with since I have been in this neighbourhood; for everybody else is so
convinced about the vampyre, that they are ready to swear by him."

     "It would take much more to convince me.  I was coming over here when I
met Mr. George Bannerworth coming to my house."

     "Yes," said George, "and Mr. Chillingworth has something to tell us of 
a
nature confirmatory of our own suspicions."

     "It is strange," said Henry; "but any piece of news, come it from what
quarter it may, seems to be confirmatory, in some degree or another, of that
dreadful belief in vampyres."

     "Why," said the doctor, "when Mr. George says that my news is of such a
character, I think he goes a little too far.  What I have to tell you, I do
not conceive has anything whatever to do with the fact, or one fact of there
being vampyres."

     "Let us hear it," said Henry.

     "It is simply this, that I was sent for by Sir Francis Varney myself."

     "You sent for?"

     "Yes; he sent for me by a special messenger to come to him, and when I
went, which, under the circumstances, you may well guess, I did with all the
celerity possible, I found it was to consult me about a flesh wound in his
arm, which was showing some angry symptoms."

     "Indeed."

     "Yes, it was so.  When I was introduced to him I found him lying on a
couch, and looking pale and unwell.  In the most respectful manner, he asked
me to be seated, and when I had taken a chair, he added, --

      "'Mr. Chillingworth, I have sent for you in consequence of a slight
accident which has happened to my arm.  I was incautiously loading some 
fire-
arms, and discharged a pistol so close to me that the bullet inflicted a 
wound
on my arm.'

     "'If you will allow me,' said I, 'to see the wound, I will give you my
opinion.'

     "He then showed me a jagged wound, which had evidently been caused by 
the
passage of a bullet, which, had it gone a little deeper, must have inflicted 
a
serious injury.  As it was, the wound was trifling.

     "He had evidently been attempting to dress it himself, but finding some
considerable inflammation, he very likely got a little alarmed."

     "You dressed the wound?"

     "I did."

     "And what do you think of Sir Francis Varney, now that you have had so
capital an opportunity," said Henry, "of a close observation of him?"

     "Why, there is certainly something odd about him which I cannot well
define, but, take him altogether, he can be a very gentlemanly man indeed."

     "So he can."

     "His manners are easy and polished; he has evidently mixed in good
society, and I never, in all my life, heard such a sweet, soft, winning
voice."

     "That is strictly him.  You noticed, I presume, his great likeness to 
the
portrait on the panel?"

     "I did.  At some moments, and viewing his face in some particular 
lights,
it showed much more strongly than at others.  My impression was that he 
could,
when he liked, look much more like the portrait on the panel than when he
allowed his face to assume its ordinary appearance."

     "Probably such an impression would be produced upon your mind," said
Charles, "by some accidental expression of the countenance which even he was
not aware of, and which often occurs in families."

     "It may be so."

     "Of course you did not hint, sir, at what has passed here with regard 
to
him?" said Henry.

     "I did not.  Being, you see, called in professionally, I had no right 
to
take advantage of that circumstance to make any remarks to him about his
private affairs."

     "Certainly not."

     "It was all one to me whether he was a vampyre or not, professionally,
and however deeply I might feel, personally, interested in the matter, I 
said
nothing to him about it, because, you see, if I had, he would have had a 
fair
opportunity of saying at once, 'Pray, sir, what is that to you?' and I 
should
have been at a loss what to reply."

     "Can we doubt," said Henry, "but that this very wound has been 
inflicted
upon Sir Francis Varney, by the pistol-bullet which was discharged at him by
Flora?"

     "Everything leads to such an assumption certainly," said Charles 
Holland.

     "And yet you cannot even deduce from that the absolute fact of Sir
Francis Varney's being a vampyre?"

     "I do not think, Mr. Chillingworth," said Marchdale, "anything would
convince you but a visit from him, and an actual attempt to fasten upon some
of your own veins."

    "That would not convince me," said Chillingworth.

     "Then you will not be convinced?"

     "I certainly will not.  I mean to hold out to the last. I said at the
first, and I say so still, that I never will give way to this most 
outrageous
superstition."

     "I wish I could think with you," said Marchdale, with a shudder; "but
there may be something in the very atmosphere of this house which has been
rendered hideous by the awful visits that have been made to it, which 
forbids
me to disbelieve in those things which others more happily situated can hold
at arm's length, and utterly repudiate."

     "There may be," said Henry; "but as to that, I think, after the very
strongly expressed wish of Flora, I will decide upon leaving the house."

     "Will you sell it or let it?"

     "The latter I should much prefer," was the reply.

     "But who will take it now, except Sir Francis Varney? Why not at once 
let
him have it?  I am well aware that this does sound odd advice, but remember,
we are all the creatures of circumstance, and that, in some cases where we
least like it, we must swim with the stream."

     "That you will not decide upon, however, at present," said Charles
Holland, as he rose.

     "Certainly not; a few days can make no difference."

     "None for the worse, certainly, and possibly much for the better."

     "Be it so; we will wait."

     "Uncle," said Charles, "Will you spare me half an hour of your 
company?"

     "An hour, my boy, if you want it," said the admiral, rising from his
chair.

     "Then this consultation is over," said Henry, "and we quite understand
that to leave the Hall is a matter determined on, and that in a few days a
decision shall come as to whether Varney the Vampyre shall be its tenant or
not."

 Next Time: The Admiral's Advice to Charles Holland. -- The Challenge to the
 Vampyre.




                               Chapter XXIII.

THE ADMIRAL'S ADVICE TO CHARLES HOLLAND. -- THE CHALLENGE TO THE VAMPYRE.


     When Charles Holland got his uncle into a room by themselves, he said, 
--

     "Uncle, you are a seaman, and accustomed to decide upon matters of
honour.  I look upon myself as having been most grievously insulted by this
Sir Francis Varney.  All accounts agree in representing him as a gentleman. 
He goes openly by a title, which, if it were not his, could easily be
contradicted; therefore, on the score of position in life, there is no fault
to find with him.  What would you do if you were insulted by this 
gentleman?"

     The old admiral's eyes sparkled, and he looked comically in the face of
Charles, as he said, --

     "I know now where you are steering."

     "What would you do, uncle?"

     "Fight him!"

     "I knew you would say so, and that's just what I want to do as regards
Sir Francis Varney."

     "Well, my boy, I don't know that you can do better.  He must be a
thundering rascal, whether he is a vampyre or not; so if you feel that he 
has
insulted you, fight him by all means, Charles."

     "I am much pleased, uncle, to find that you take my view of the 
subject,"
said Charles.  "I knew that if I mentioned such a thing to the Bannerworths,
they would endeavour all in their power to persuade me against it."

     "Yes, no doubt; because they are all impressed with a strange fear of
this fellow's vampyre powers.  Besides, if a man is going to fight, the 
fewer
people he mentions it to the most decidedly the better, Charles."

     "I believe that is the fact, uncle.  Should I overcome Varney, there 
will
most likely be at once an end to the numerous and uncomfortable perplexities
of the Bannerworths as regards him; and if he overcome me, why, then, at all
events, I shall have made an effort to rescue Flora from the dread of this
man."

     "And then he shall fight me," added the admiral, "so he shall have two
chances, at all events, Charles."

     "Nay, uncle, that would, you know, scarcely be fair. Besides, if I 
should
fall, I solemnly bequeath Flora Bannerworth to your good offices.  I much 
fear
that the pecuniary affairs of poor Henry, -- from no fault of his, Heaven
knows, -- are in a very bad state, and that Flora may yet live to want some
kind and able friend."

     "Never fear, Charles.  The young creature shall never want while the 
old
admiral has got a shot in the locker."

     "Thank you, uncle, thank you.  I have ample cause to know, and to be 
able
to rely upon your kind and generous nature.  And now about the challenge?"

     "You write it, boy, and I'll take it."

     "Will you second me, uncle?"

     "To be sure I will.  I wouldn't trust anybody else to do so on any
account.  You leave all the arrangements with me, and I'll second you as you
ought to be seconded."

     "Then I will write it at once, for I have received injuries at the 
hands
of that man, or devil, be he what he may, that I cannot put up with.  His
visit to the chamber of her whom I love would alone constitute ample ground 
of
action."

     "I should say it rather would, my boy."

     "And after this corroborative story of the wound, I cannot for a moment
doubt that Sir Francis Varney is the vampyre, or the personifier of the
vampyre."

     "That's clear enough, Charles,  Come, just you write your challenge, my
boy, at once, and let me have it."

     "I will, uncle."

     Charles was a little astonished, although pleased, at his uncle's ready
acquiescence in his fighting a vampyre, but that circumstance he ascribed to
the old man's habits of life, which made him so familiar with strife and
personal contentions of all sorts, that he did not ascribe to it that amount
of importance which more peaceable people did.  Had he, while he was writing
the note to Sir Francis Varney, seen the old admiral's face, and the
exceedingly cunning look it wore, he might have suspected that the
acquiescence in the duel was but a seeming acquiescence.  This, however,
escaped him, and in a few moments he read to his uncle the following note: -
-

     "TO SIR FRANCIS VARNEY.

     "Sir, -- The expressions made use of towards me by you, as well as
general circumstances, which I need not further allude to here, induce me to
demand of you that satisfaction due from one gentleman to another.  My 
uncle,
Admiral Bell, is the bearer of this note, and will arrange preliminaries 
with
any friend you may choose to appoint to act in your behalf.  I am, sir, 
yours,
&c.

                            "CHARLES HOLLAND."

     "Will that do?" said Charles.

     "Capital!" said the admiral.

     "I am glad you like it."

     "Oh, I could not help liking it.  The least said and the most to the
purpose, always pleases me best; and this explains nothing and demands all 
you
want-- which is a fight; so it's all right, you see, and nothing can 
possibly
be better."

     Charles did glance in his uncle's face, for he suspected, from the 
manner
in which these words were uttered, that the old man was amusing himself a
little at his expense.  The admiral, however, looked so supernaturally 
serious
that Charles was foiled.

     "I repeat, it's a capital letter," he said.

     "Yes, you said so."

     "Well, what are you staring at?"

     "Oh, nothing."

     "Do you doubt my word?"

     "Not at all, uncle; only I thought there was a degree of irony in the
manner in which you spoke."

     "Not at all, my boy.  I never was more serious in all my life."

     "Very good.  Then you will remember that I leave my honour in this 
affair
completely in your hands."

     "Depend upon me, my boy."

     "I will, and do."

     "I'll be off and see the fellow at once."

     "The admiral bustled out of the room, and in a few moments Charles 
heard
him calling loudly, --

     "Jack-- Jack Pringle, you lubber, where are you? -- Jack Pringle, I 
say."

     "Ay, ay, sir," said Jack, emerging from the kitchen, where he had been
making himself generally useful in assisting Mrs. Bannerworth, there being 
no
servant in the house, to cook some dinner for the family.

     "Come on, you rascal, we are going for a walk."

     "The rations will be served out soon," growled Jack.

     "We shall be back in time, you cormorant, never fear. You are always
thinking of eating and drinking, you are, Jack; and I'll be hanged if I 
think
you ever think of anything else.  Come on, will you; I'm going on rather a
particular cruise just now, so mind what you are about."

     "Aye, aye, sir," said the tar, and these two originals, who so 
perfectly
understood each other, walked away, conversing as they went, and their
different voices coming upon the ear of Charles, until distance obliterated
all impression of the sound.

     Charles paced to and fro in the room where he had held this brief and
conclusive conversation with his uncle.  He was thoughtful, as any one might
well be who knew not but that the next four-and-twenty hours would be the
limit of his sojourn in this world.

     "Oh, Flora-- Flora!" he at length said, "how happy we might to have
been! but all is past now, and there seems nothing left us and that is in my
killing this fearful man who is invested with so dreadful an existence.  And
if I do kill him in fair and in open fight, I will take care that his mortal
frame has no power again to revisit the glimpses of the moon."

     It was strange to imagine that such was the force of many concurrent
circumstances, that a young man like Charles Holland, of first-rate 
abilities
and education, should find it necessary to give in so far to a belief which
was repugnant to all his best feelings and habits of thought, as to be
reasoning with himself upon the best means of preventing the resuscitation 
of
the corpse of a vampyre. But so it was.  His imagination had yielded to a
succession of events which very few persons indeed could have held out
against.

     "I have heard and read," he said, as he continued his agitated and 
uneasy
walk, "of how these dreadful beings are to be kept in their graves.  I have
heard of stakes being driven through the body so as to pin it to the earth
until the gradual progress of decay has rendered its revivification a thing 
of
utter and total impossibility. Then, again," he added, after a slight pause,
"I have heard of their being burned, and the ashes  scattered to the winds 
of
Heaven to prevent them from ever again uniting or assuming human form."

     These were disagreeable and strange fancies, and he shuddered while he
indulged in them.  He felt a kind of trembling horror come over him even at
the thought of engaging in conflict with a being who, perhaps, had lived 
more
than a hundred years.

     "That portrait," he thought, "on the panel, is the portrait of a man in
the prime of life.  If it be the portrait of Sir Francis Varney, by the date
which the family ascribe to it he must be nearly one hundred and fifty years
of age now."

     This was a supposition which carried the imagination to a vast amount 
of
strange conjectures.

     "What changes he must have witnessed about him in that time," thought
Charles.  "How he must have seen kingdoms totter and fall, and how many
changes of habits, of manners, and of custom must he have become a spectator
of.  Renewing too, ever and anon, his fearful existence by such fearful
means."

     This was a wide field of conjecture for a fertile imagination, and now
that he was on the eve of engaging with such a being in mortal combat, on
behalf of her he loved, the thoughts it gave rise to came more strongly and
thickly upon him than ever they had done before.

     "But I will fight him,"  he suddenly said, "for Flora's sake, were he a
hundred times more hideous a being than so many evidences tend to prove him. 
I will fight with him, and it may be my fate to rid the world of such a
monster in human form."

     Charles worked himself up to a kind of enthusiasm by which he almost
succeeded in convincing himself that, in attempting the destruction of Sir
Francis Varney, he was the champion of human nature.

     It would be aside from the object of these pages, which is to record
facts as they occurred, to enter into the metaphysical course of reasoning
which came across Charles's mind; suffice it to say that he felt nothing
shaken as regarded his resolve to meet Varney the Vampyre, and that he made 
up
his mind the conflict should be one of life or death.

     "It must be so," he said.  "It must be so.  Either he or I must fall in
the fight which shall surely be."

     He now sought Flora, for how soon might he now be torn from her for 
ever
by the irresistible hand of death.  He felt that, during the few brief hours
which now would only elapse previous to his meeting with Sir Francis Varney,
he could not enjoy too much of the society of her who reigned supreme in his
heart, and held in her own keeping his best affections.

     But while Charles is thus employed, let us follow his uncle and Jack
Pringle to the residence of Varney, which, as the reader is aware, was so 
near
at hand that it required not many minutes' sharp walking to reach it.

     The admiral knew well he could trust Jack with any secret, for long
habits of discipline and deference to the orders of superiors takes off the
propensity to blabbering which, among civilians who are not accustomed to
discipline, is so very prevalent.  The old man therefore explained to Jack
what he meant to do, and it received Jack's full approval; but as in the
enforced detail of other matters it must come out, we will not here
prematurely enter into the admiral's plans.

     When they reached the residence of Sir Francis Varney, they were 
received
courteously enough, and the admiral desired Jack to wait for him the 
handsome
hall of the house, while he was shewn up stairs to the private room of the
vampyre.

     "Confound the fellow!" muttered the old admiral, "he is well lodged at
all events.  I should say he was not one of those vampyres who have nowhere 
to
go to but their own coffins when the evening comes."

     The room into which the admiral was shewn had green blinds to it, and
they were all drawn down.  It is true that the sun was shining brightly
outside, although transiently, but still a strange green tinge was thrown 
over
everything in the room, and more particularly did it appear to fall upon the
face of Varney, converting his usually sallow countenance into a still more
hideous and strange colour. He was sitting upon a couch, and, when the 
admiral
came in, he rose, and said, in a deep-toned voice, extremely different to 
that
he usually spoke in, --

     "My humble home is much honoured, sir, by your presence in it."

     "Good morning," said the admiral.  "I have come to speak to you, sir,
rather seriously."

     "However abrupt this announcement may sound to me," said Varney, "I am
quite sure I shall always hear, with the most profound respect, whatever
Admiral Bell may have to say."

     "There is no respect required," said the admiral, "but only a little
attention."

     Sir Francis bowed in a stately manner, saying, --

     "I shall be quite unhappy if you will not be seated, Admiral Bell."

     "Oh, never mind that, Sir Francis Varney, if you be Sir Francis Varney;
for you may be the devil himself, for all I know.  My nephew, Charles 
Holland,
considers that, one way and another, he has a very tolerable quarrel with
you."

     "I much grieve to hear it."

     "Do you?"

     "Believe me, I do.  I am most scrupulous in what I say; and an 
assertion
that I am grieved, you may thoroughly and entirely depend upon."

     "Well, well, never mind that; Charles Holland is a young man just
entering into life.  He loves a girl who is, I think, every way worthy of
him."

     "Oh, what a felicitous prospect!"

     "Just hear me out, if you please."

     "With pleasure, sir-- with pleasure."

     "Well, then, when a young, hot-headed fellow thinks he has a good 
ground
of quarrel with anybody, you will not be surprised at his wanting to fight 
it
out."

     "Not at all."

     "Well, then, to come to the point, my nephew, Charles Holland, has a
fancy for fighting with you."

     "Ah!"

     "You take it d----d easy."

     "My dear sir, why should I be uneasy?  He is not my nephew, you know.  
I
shall have no particular cause, beyond those feelings of common compassion
which I hope inhabit my breast as well as every one else's."

     "What do you mean?"

     "Why, he is a young man just, as you say, entering into life, and I
cannot help thinking it would be a pity to cut him off like a flower in the
bud, so very soon."

     "Oh, you make quite sure, then, of settling him, do you?"

     "My dear sir, only consider; he might be very troublesome, indeed; you
know young men are hot-headed and troublesome.  Even if I were only to maim
him, he might be a continual and never-ceasing annoyance to me.  I think I
should be absolutely, in a manner of speaking, compelled to cut him off."

     "The devil you do!"

     "As you say, sir."

     "D--n your assurance, Mr. Vampyre, or whatever odd fish you may be."

     "Admiral Bell, I never called upon you and received a courteous
reception, and then insulted you."

     "Then why do you talk of cutting off a better man than yourself?  D--n
it, what would you say to him cutting you off?"

     "Oh, as for me, my good sir, that's quite another thing.  Cutting me 
off
is very doubtful."

     Sir Francis Varney gave a strange smile as he spoke, and shook his 
head,
as if some most extraordinary and extravagant proposition had been mooted,
which it was scarcely worth the while of anybody possessed of common sense 
to
set about expecting.

     Admiral Bell felt strongly inclined to get into a rage, but he 
repressed
the idea as much as he could, although, but for the curious faint green 
light
that came through the blinds, his heightened colour would have sufficiently
proclaimed what state of mind he was in.

     "Mr. Varney," he said, "all this is quite beside the question; but at 
all
events, if it have any weight at all, it could to have a considerable
influence in deciding you to accept the terms I propose."

     "What are they, sir?"

     "Why, that you permit me to espouse my nephew Charles's quarrel, and 
meet
you instead of him."

     "You meet me?"

     "Yes; I've met a better man more than once before.  It can make no
difference to you."

     "I don't know that, Admiral Bell.  One generally likes, in a duel, to
face him with whom one has had the misunderstanding, be it on what grounds 
it
may."

     "There's some reason, I know, in what you say; but, surely, if I am
willing, you need not object."

     "And is your nephew willing thus to shift the danger and the job of
resenting his own quarrels on to your shoulders?"

     "No; he knows nothing about it.  He has written you a challenge, of 
which
I am the bearer, but I voluntarily, and of my own accord, wish to meet you
instead."

     "This is a strange mode of proceeding."

     "If you will not accede to it, and fight him first, and any harm comes 
to
him, you shall fight me afterwards."

     "Indeed."

     "Yes, indeed you shall, however surprised you may look."

     "As this appears to be a family affair, then," said Sir Francis Varney,
"it certainly does appear immaterial which of you I fight with first."

     "Quite so; now you take a sensible view of the question.  Will you meet
me?"

     "I have no particular objection.  Have you settled all your affairs, 
and
made your will?"

     "What's that to you?"

     "Oh, I only asked, because there is generally so much food for 
litigation
if a man dies intestate, and is worth any money."

     "You make devilish sure," said the admiral, "of being the victor.  Have
you made your will?"

     "Oh, my will," smiled Sir Francis; "that, my good sir, is quite an
indifferent affair."

     "Well, make it or not, as you like.  I am old, I know, but I can pull a
trigger as well as any one."

     "Do what?"

     "Pull a trigger."

     "Why, you don't suppose I resort to any such barbarous modes of
fighting?"

     "Barbarous!  Why, how do you fight then?"

     "As a gentleman, with my sword."

     "Swords!  Oh, nonsense! nobody fights with swords now-a-days.  That's 
all
exploded."

     "I cling to the customs and the fashions of my youth," said Varney.  "I
have been, years ago, accustomed always to wear a sword, and to be without 
one
now vexes me."

     "Pray, how many years ago?"

     "I am older than I look, but that is not the question. I am willing to
meet you with swords if you like.  You are no doubt aware that, as the
challenged party, I am entitled to the choice of weapons."

     "I am."

     "Then you cannot object to my availing myself of the one in the use of
which I am perfectly unequalled."

     "Indeed."

     "Yes, I am, I think, the first swordsman in Europe; I have had immense
practice."

     "Well, sir, you have certainly made a most unexpected choice of 
weapons. 
I can use a sword still, but am by no means I master of fencing.  However, 
it
shall not be said that I went back from my word, and let the chances be as
desperate as they may, I will meet you."

     "Very good."

     "With swords?"

     "Ay, with swords; but I must have everything properly arranged, so that
no blame can rest on me, you know.  As you will be killed, you are safe from
all consequences, but I shall be in a very different position; so, if you
please, I must have this meeting got up in such a manner as shall enable me 
to
prove, to whoever may question me on the subject, that you had fair play."

     "Oh, never fear that."

     "But I do fear it.  The world, my good sir, is censorious, and you 
cannot
stop people from saying extremely ill-natured things."

     "What is it that you require, then?"

     "I require that you send me a friend with a formal challenge."

     "Well?"

     "Then I shall refer him to a friend of mine, and they two must settle
everything between them."

     "Is that all?"

     "Not quite.  I will have a surgeon on the ground, in case, when I pink
you, there should be a chance of saving your life.  It always looks humane."

     "When you pink me?"

     "Precisely."

     "Upon my word, you take these affairs easy.  I suppose you have had a 
few
of them?"

     "Oh, a good number.  People like yourself worry me into them.  I don't
like the trouble, I assure you; it is no amusement to me.  I would rather, 
by
a great deal, make some concession than fight, because I will fight with
swords, and the result is then so certain that there is no danger in the
matter to me."

     "Hark you, Sir Francis Varney.  You are either a very clever actor, or 
a
man, as you say, of such skill with your sword, that you can make sure of 
the
result of a duel.  You know, therefore, that it is not fair play on your 
part
to fight a duel with that weapon."

     "Oh, I beg your pardon there.  I never challenge anybody, and when
foolish people call me out, contrary to my inclination, I think I am bound 
to
take what care of myself I can."

     "D--n me, there's some reason in that, too," said the admiral; "but why
do you insult people?"

     "People insult me first."

     "Oh, nonsense!"

     "How should you like to be called a vampyre, and stared at as if you 
were
some hideous natural phenomenon?"

     "Well, but-- "

     "I say, Admiral Bell, how should you like it?  I am a harmless country
gentleman, and because, in the heated imagination of some member of a
crack-brained family, some housebreaker has been converted into a vampyre, I
am to be pitched upon as the man, and insulted and persecuted accordingly."

     "But you forget the proofs."

     "What proofs?"

     "The portrait, for one."

     "What!  Because there is an accidental likeness between me and an old
picture, am I to be set down as a vampyre? Why, when I was in Austria last, 
I
saw an old portrait of a celebrated court fool, and you so strongly resemble
it, that I was quite struck when I first saw you with the likeness; but I 
was
not so unpolite as to tell you that I considered you were the court fool
turned vampyre."

     "D--n your assurance!"

     "And d--n yours, if you come to that."

     The admiral was fairly beaten.  Sir Francis Varney was by far too
long-headed and witty for him.  After now in vain endeavouring to find
something to say, the old man buttoned up his coat in a great passion, and
looking fiercely at Varney, he said, --

     "I don't pretend to a gift of the gab.  D--n me, it ain't one of my
peculiarities; but though you may talk me down, you sha'n't keep me down."

     "Very good, sir."

     "It is not very good.  You shall hear from me."

     "I am willing."

     "I don't care whether you are willing or not.  You shall find that when
once I begin to tackle an enemy, I don't so easily leave him.  One or both 
of
us, sir, is sure to sink."

     "Agreed."

     "So say I.  You shall find that I'm a tar for all weathers, and if you
were hundred and fifty vampyres all rolled into one, I'd tackle you 
somehow."

     The admiral walked to the door in high dudgeon; when he was near to it,
Varney said, in some of his most winning and gentle accents, --

     "Will you not take some refreshment, sir, before you go from my humble
house?"

     "No!" roared the admiral.

     "Something cooling?"

     "No!"

     "Very good, sir.  A hospitable host can do no more that offer to
entertain his guests."

     Admiral Bell turned at the door, and said, with some degree of intense
bitterness, "You look rather poorly.  I suppose, tonight, you will go and 
suck
somebody's blood, you shark-- you confounded vampyre!  You ought to be made 
to
swallow a red-hot brick, and then let dance about till it digests."

     Varney smiled as he rang the bell, and said to a servant, --

     "Show my very excellent friend Admiral Bell out.  He will not take any
refreshments."

     The servant bowed, and preceded the admiral down the staircase; but, to
his great surprise, instead of a compliment in the shape of a shilling or
half-a-crown for his pains, he received a tremendous kick behind, with a
request to go and take it to his master, with his compliments.

     The fume that the old admiral was in beggars all description.  He 
walked
to Bannerworth Hall at such a rapid pace, that Jack Pringle had the greatest
difficulty in the world to keep up with him, so as to be at all within
speaking distance.

     "Hilloa, Jack," cried the old man, when they were close to the Hall. 
"Did you see me kick that fellow?"

     "Ay, ay, sir."

     "Well, that's some consolation, at any rate, if somebody saw it.  It
ought to have been his master, that's all I can say to it, and I wish it 
had."

     "How have you settled it, sir?"

     "Settled what?"

     "The fight, sir."

     "D--n me, Jack, I haven't settled it at all."

     "That's bad, sir."

     "I know it is; but it shall be settled for all that, I can tell him, 
let
him vapour as much as he may about pinking me, and one thing and another."

     "Pinking you, sir?"

     "Yes.  He wants to fight with cutlasses, or toasting-forks, d--n me, I
don't know exactly which, and then he must have a surgeon on the ground, for
fear when he pinks me I shouldn't slip my cable in a regular way, and he
should be blamed."

     Jack gave a long whistle, as he replied, --

     "Going to do it, sir?"

     "I don't know what I'm going to do.  Mind, Jack, mum's the word."

     "Ay, ay, sir."

     "I'll turn the matter over in my mind, and then decide upon what had 
best
be done.  If he pinks me, I'll take d----d good care he don't pink Charles."

     "No, sir, don't let him do that.  A _wamphigher_, sir, ain't no good
opponent to anybody.  I never seed one afore, but it strikes me as the best
way to settle him, would be to shut him up in some little bit of a cabin, 
and
then smoke him with brimstone, sir."

     "Well, well, I'll consider, Jack, I'll consider. Something must be 
done,
and that quickly too.  Zounds, here's Charles-- what the deuce shall I say 
to
him, by way of an excuse, I wonder, for not arranging his affair with 
Varney? 
Hang me, if I ain't taken aback now, and don't know where to place a hand."

Narrative.

THE LETTER TO CHARLES. -- THE QUARREL. -- THE ADMIRAL'S NARRATIVE. -- THE
MIDNIGHT MEETING


     It was Charles Holland who now advanced hurriedly to meet the admiral. 
The young man's manner was anxious.  He was evidently most intent upon 
knowing
what answer could be sent by Sir Francis Varney to his challenge.

"Uncle," he said, "tell me at once, will he meet me?  You can talk of
particulars afterwards, but now tell me at once if he will meet me?"

     "Why, as to that," said the admiral, with a great deal of fidgetty
hesitation, "you see, I can't exactly say."

     "Not say!"

     "No.  He's a very odd fish.  Don't you think he's a very odd fish, Jack
Pringle?"

     "Ay, ay, sir."

     "There, you hear, Charles, that Jack is of my opinion that your 
opponent
is an odd fish."

     "But, uncle, why trifle with my impatience thus?  Have you seen Sir
Francis Varney?"

     "Seen him.  Oh, yes."

     "And what did he say?"

     "Why, to tell the truth, my lad, I advise you not to fight with him at
all."

     "Uncle, is this like you?  This advice from you, to compromise my 
honour,
after sending a man a challenge?"

     "D--n it all, Jack, I don't know how to get out of it," said the 
admiral.
"I tell you what it is, Charles, he wants to fight with swords; and what on
earth is the use of your engaging with a fellow who has been practising at 
his
weapon for more than a hundred years?"

     "Well, uncle, if any one had told me that you would be terrified by 
this
Sir Francis Varney into advising me not to fight, I should have had no
hesitation whatever in saying such a thing was impossible."

     "I terrified?"

     "Why, you advise me not to meet this man, even after I have challenged
him."

     "Jack," said the admiral, "I can't carry it on, you see.  I never could
go on with anything that was not as plain as an anchor, and quite
straightforward.  I must just tell all that has occurred."

     "Ay, ay, sir.  The best way."

     "You think so, Jack?"

     "I know it is, sir, always axing pardon for having a opinion at all,
excepting when it happens to be the same as yourn, sir."

     "Hold your tongue, you libellous villain!  Now, listen to me, Charles.  
I
got up a scheme of my own."

     Charles gave a groan, for he had a very tolerable appreciation of his
uncle's amount of skill in getting up a scheme of any kind of description.

     "Now here am I," continued the admiral, "an old hulk, and not fit for 
use
any more.  What's the use of me, I should like to know?  Well, that's 
settled.
But you are young and hearty, and have a long life before you.  Why should 
you
throw away your life upon a lubberly vampyre?"

     "I begin to perceive now, uncle," said Charles, reproachfully, "why 
you,
with such apparent readiness, agreed to this duel taking place."

     "Well I intended to fight the fellow myself, that's the long and short 
of
it, boy."

     "How could you treat me so?"

     "No nonsense, Charles.  I tell you it was all in the family.  I 
intended
to fight him myself.  What was the odds whether I slipped my cable with his
assistance, or in the regular course a little after this?  That's the way to
argufy the subject; so, as I tell you, I made up my mind to fight him 
myself."

     Charles looked despairingly, but said,--

     "What was the result?"

     "Oh, the result!  D--n me, I suppose that's to come.  The vagabond 
won't
fight like a Christian.  He says he's quite willing to fight anybody that
calls him out, provided it's all regular."

     "Well -- well."

     "And he, being the party challenged -- for he says he never himself
challenges anybody, as he is quite tired of it -- must have his choice of
weapons."

     "He is entitled to that; but it is generally understood now-a-days that
pistols are the weapons in use among gentlemen for such purposes."

     "Ah, but he won't understand any such thing, I tell you. He will fight
with swords."

     "I suppose he is, then, an adept at the use of the sword?"

     "He says he is."

     "No doubt -- no doubt.  I cannot blame a man for choosing, when he has
the liberty of choice, that weapon in the use of which he most particularly,
from practice, excels."

     "Yes; but if he be one half the swordsman he has had time enough,
according to all accounts, to be, what sort of chance have you with him?"

     "Do I hear you reasoning thus?"

     "Yes, to be sure you do.  I have turned wonderfully prudent, you see:  
so
I mean to fight him myself, and mind, now, you have nothing whatever to do
with it."

     "An effort of prudence that, certainly."

     "Well, didn't I say so?"

     "Come -- come, uncle, this won't do.  I have challenged Sir Francis
Varney, and I must meet him with any weapon he may, as the challenged party,
choose to select.  Besides, you are not, I dare say, aware that I am a very
good fencer, and probably stand as fair a chance as Varney in a contest with
swords."

     "Indeed!"

     "Yes, uncle.  I could not be so long on the continent as I have been
without picking up a good knowledge of the sword, which is so popular all 
over
Germany."

     "Humph!  but only consider, this d----d fellow is no less than a 
hundred
and fifty years old."

     "I care not."

     "Yes, but I do."

     "Uncle, uncle, I tell you I will fight with him; and if you do not
arrange matters for me so that I can have the meeting with this man, which I
have myself sought, and cannot, even if I wished, now recede from with 
honour,
I must seek some other less scrupulous friend to do so."

     "Give me an hour or two to think of it, Charles," said the admiral. 
"Don't speak to any one else, but give me a little time.  You shall have no
cause of complaint.  Your honour cannot suffer in my hands."

     "I will wait your leisure, uncle; but remember that such affairs as
these, when once broached, had always better be concluded with all 
convenient
dispatch."

     "I know that, boy -- I know that."

     The admiral walked away, and Charles, who really felt much fretted at 
the
delay which had taken place, returned to the house.

     He had not been there long, when a lad, who had been temporarily hired
during the morning by Henry to answer the gate, brought him a note saying,--

     "A servant, sir, left this for you just now."

     "For me?" said Charles  as he glanced at the direction. "This is 
strange,
for I have no acquaintance about here.  Does any one wait?"

     "No, sir."

     The note was properly directed to him, therefore Charles Holland at 
once
opened it.  A glance at the bottom of the page told him that it came from 
his
enemy, Sir Francis Varney, and then he read it with much eagerness.  It ran
thus:--

     "SIR, -- Your uncle, as he stated himself to be, Admiral Bell, was the
bearer to me, as I understood him this day, of a challenge from you.  Owing 
to
some unaccountable hallucination of intellect, he seemed to imagine that I
intended to set myself up as a sort of animated target, for any one to shoot
at who might have a fancy so to do.

     "According to this eccentric view of the case, the admiral had the
kindness to offer to fight me first, when, should he not have the good 
fortune
to put me out of the world, you were to try your skill, doubtless.

     "I need scarcely say that I object to these family arrangements.  You
have challenged me, and fancying the offence sufficient, you defy me to 
mortal
combat.  If, therefore, I fight with any one at all, it must be with you.

     "You will clearly understand me, sir, that I do not accuse you of being
at all privy to this freak of intellect of your uncle's.  He, no doubt, 
alone
conceived it, with a laudable desire on his part of serving you.  If, 
however,
you have any inclination to meet me, do so to-night, in the middle of the 
park
surrounding your own friends' estate.

     "There is a pollard oak growing close to a small pool; you, no doubt,
have noticed the spot often.  Meet me there, if you please, and any
satisfaction you like I will give you, at twelve o'clock this night.

     "Come alone, or you will not see me.  It shall be at your own option
entirely, to convert the meeting to a hostile one or not.  You need send me 
no
answer to this.  If you are at the place I mention at the time I have named,
well and good.  If you are not, I can only, if I please, imagine that you
shrink from a meeting with

                        "FRANCIS VARNEY."

     Charles Holland read this letter twice over carefully, and then folding
it up, and placing it in his pocket, he said,--

     "Yes, I will meet him; he may be assured that I do not shrink from
Francis Varney.  In the name of honour, love, virtue, and Heaven, I will 
meet
this man, and it shall go hard with me but I will this night wring from him
the secret of what he really is.  For the sake of her who is so dear to me--
for her sake, I will meet this man, or monster, be he what he may."

     It would have been far more prudent had Charles informed Henry
Bannerworth or George of his determination to meet the vampyre that evening,
but he did not do so.  Somehow he fancied it would be some reproach against
his courage if he did not go, and go alone, too, for he could not help
suspecting that, from the conduct of his uncle, Sir Francis Varney might 
have
got up an opinion inimical to his courage.

     With all the eager excitement of youth, there was nothing that arrayed
itself to his mind in such melancholy and uncomfortable colours as an
imputation upon his courage.

     "I will show this vampyre, if he be such," he said, "that I am not 
afraid
to meet him, and alone, too, at his own hour -- at midnight, even when, if 
his
preternatural powers be of more avail to him than at any other time, he can
attempt, if he dare, to use them."

     Charles resolved upon going armed, and with the greatest care he loaded
his pistols, and placed them aside ready for action, when the time should 
come
to set out to meet the vampyre at the spot in the park which had been
particularly alluded to in his letter.

     This spot was perfectly well known to Charles; indeed, no one could be 
a
single day at Bannerworth Hall without noticing it, so prominent an object 
was
that pollard oak, standing, as it did, alone, with the beautiful green sward
all around it.  Near it was the pool which had been mentioned, which was, in
reality, a fish-pond, and some little distance off commenced the thick
plantation, among the intricacies of which Sir Francis Varney, or the 
vampyre,
had been supposed to disappear, after the revivification of his body at the
full of the moon.

     This spot was in view of several of the windows of the house, so that 
if
the night should happen to be a very light one, and any of the inhabitants 
of
the Hall should happen to have the curiosity to look from those particular
windows, no doubt the meeting between Charles Holland and the vampyre would 
be
seen.

     This, however, was a contingency which was nothing to Charles, whatever
it might be to Sir Francis Varney, and he scarcely at all considered it was
worth consideration.  He felt more happy and comfortable now that everything
seemed to be definitely arranged by which he could come to some sort of
explanation with that mysterious being who had so effectually, as yet,
succeeded in destroying his peace of mind and his prospects of happiness.

     "I will this night force him to declare himself," thought Charles.  "He
shall tell me who and what he really is, and by some means I will endeavor 
to
put an end to those frightful persecutions which Flora has suffered."

     This was a thought which considerably raised Charles's spirits, and 
when
he sought Flora again, which he now did, she was surprised to see him so 
much
more easy and composed in his mind, which was sufficiently shown by his
manner, than he had been but so short a time before.

     "Charles," she said, "what has happened to give such an impetus to your
spirits?"

     "Nothing, dear Flora, nothing; but I have been endeavoring to throw 
from
my mind all gloomy thoughts, and to convince myself that in the future you 
and
I, dearest, may yet be very happy."

     "Oh, Charles, if I could but think so."

     "Endeavour, Flora, to think so.  Remember how much our happiness is
always in our own power, Flora, and that, let fate do her worst, so long as 
we
are true to each other, we have a recompense for every ill."

     "Oh, indeed, Charles, that is a dear recompense."

     "And it is well that no force of circumstances short of death itself 
can
divide us."

     "True, Charles, true, and I am more than ever now bound to look upon 
you
with a loving heart; for have you not clung to me generously under
circumstances which, if any at all could have justified you in rending 
asunder
every tie which bound us together, surely would have done so most fully."

     "It is misfortune and distress that tries love," said Charles.  "It is
thus that the touchstone is applied to see if it be current gold indeed, or
some base metal, which by a superficial glitter imitates it."

     "And your love is indeed true gold."

     "I  am unworthy of one glance from those dear eyes if it were not."

     "Oh, if we could but go from here, I think then we might be happy.  A
strong impression is upon my mind, and has been so for some time, that these
persecutions to which I have been subjected are peculiar to this house."

     "Think you so?"

     "I do, indeed!"

     "It may be so, Flora.  You are aware that your brother has made up his
mind that he will leave the Hall."

     "Yes, yes."

     "And that only in deference to an expressed wish of mine he put off the
carrying such a resolve into effect for a few days."

     "He said so much."

     "Do not, however, imagine, dearest Flora, that those few days will be
idly spent."

     "Nay, Charles, I could not imagine so."

     "Believe me, I have some hopes that in that short space of time I shall
be able to accomplish yet something which shall have a material effect upon
the present posture of affairs."

     "Do not run into danger, Charles."

     "I will not.  Believe me, Flora, I have too much appreciation of the
value of an existence which is blessed by your love, to encounter any 
needless
risks."

     "You say needless.  Why do you not confide in me, and tell me if the
object you have in view to accomplish in the few days delay is a dangerous 
one
at all."

     "Will you forgive me, Flora, if for once I keep a secret from you?"

     "Then, Charles, along with the forgiveness I must conjure up a host of
apprehensions."

     "Nay, why so?"

     "You would tell me if there were no circumstances that you feared would
fill me with alarm."

     "Now, Flora, your fears and not your judgment condemn me. Surely you
cannot think me so utterly heedless as to court danger for danger's sake."

     "No, not so -- -- "

     "You pause."

     "And yet you have a sense of what you call honour, which, I fear, would
lead you into much risk."

     "I have a sense of honour; but not that foolish one which hangs far 
more
upon the opinions of others than my own.  If I thought a course of honour 
lay
before me, and all the world, in a mistaken judgment, were to condemn it as
wrong, I would follow it."

     "You are right, Charles, you are right.  Let me pray of you to be
careful, and, at all events, to interpose no more delay to our leaving this
house than you shall feel convinced is absolutely necessary for some object 
of
real and permanent importance."

     Charles promised Flora Bannerworth that for her sake, as well as his 
own,
he would be most specially careful of his safety; and then in such endearing
conversation as may well be supposed to be dictated by such hearts as theirs
another happy hour was passed away.

     They pictured to themselves the scene where first they met, and with a
world of interest hanging on every word they uttered, they told each other 
of
the first delightful dawnings of that affection which had sprung up between
them, and which they fondly believed neither time nor circumstance would 
have
the power to change or subvert.

     In the meantime the old admiral was surprised that Charles was so
patient, and had not been to him to demand the result of his deliberation.

     But he knew not on what rapid pinions time flies, when in the presence 
of
those whom we love.  What was an actual hour, was but a fleeting minute to
Charles Holland, as he sat with Flora's hand clasped in his, and looking at
her sweet face.

     At length a clock striking reminded him of his engagement with his 
uncle,
and he reluctantly rose.

     "Dear Flora," he said, "I am going to sit up to watch to-night, so be
under no sort of apprehension."

     "I will feel doubly safe," she said.

     "I have now something to talk to my uncle about, and must leave you."

     Flora smiled, and held out her hand to him.  He pressed it to his 
heart. 
He knew not what impulse came over him, but for the first time he kissed the
cheek of the beautiful girl.

     With a heightened colour she gently repulsed him.  He took a long
lingering look at her as he passed out of the room, and when the door was
closed between them, the sensation he experienced was as if some sudden 
cloud
has swept across the face of the sun, dimming to a vast extent its precious
lustre.

     A strange heaviness came across his spirits, which before had been so
unaccountably raised.  He felt as if the shadow of some coming evil was
resting on his soul -- as if some momentous calamity was preparing for him,
which would almost be enough to drive him to madness, and irredeemable
despair.

     "What can this be," he exclaimed, "that thus oppressed me? What feeling
is this that seems to tell me, I shall never again see Flora Bannerworth?"

     Unconsciously he uttered these words, which betrayed the nature of his
worst forebodings.

     "Oh, this is weakness," he then added.  "I must fight out against this;
it is mere nervousness.  I must not endure it, I will not suffer myself thus
to become the sport of imagination. Courage, courage, Charles Holland.  
There
are real evils enough, without your adding to them by those of a disordered
fancy. Courage, courage, courage."

 Next Time: The Admiral's Opinion. -- The Request of Charles.




                                Chapter XXV.

THE ADMIRAL'S OPINION. -- THE REQUEST OF CHARLES.


     Charles then sought the admiral, whom he found with his hands behind 
him,
pacing to and fro in one of the long walks of the garden, evidently in a 
very
unsettled state of mind.  When Charles appeared, he quickened his pace, and
looked in such a state of unusual perplexity that it was quite ridiculous to
observe him.

     "I suppose, uncle, you have made up your mind thoroughly by this time?"

     "Well, I don't know that."

     "Why, you have had long enough surely to think over it.  I have not
troubled you soon."

     "Well, I cannot exactly say you have, but, somehow or another, I don't
think very fast, and I have an unfortunate propensity after a time of coming
exactly round to where I began."

     "Then, to tell the truth, uncle, you can come to no sort of 
conclusion."

     "Only one."

     "And what may that be?"

     "Why, that you are right in one thing, Charles, which is, that having
sent a challenge to this fellow of a vampyre, you must fight him."

     "I suspect that that is a conclusion you had from the first, uncle?"

     "Why so?"

     "Because it is an obvious and a natural one.  All your doubts, and
trouble, and perplexities, have been to try and find some excuse for not
entertaining that opinion, and now that you really find it in vain to make 
it,
I trust that you will accede as you first promised to do, and not seek by 
any
means to thwart me."

     "I will not thwart you, my boy, although in my opinion you ought not to
fight with a vampyre."

     "Never mind that.  We cannot urge that as a valid excuse, so long as he
chooses to deny being one.  And after all, if he be really wrongfully
suspected, you must admit that he is a very injured man."

     "Injured! -- nonsense.  If he is not a vampyre, he's some other
out-of-the-way sort of fish, you may depend.  He's the oddest-looking fellow
ever I came across in all my born days, ashore or afloat."

     "Is he?"

     "Yes, he is: and yet, when I come to look at the thing again, in my 
mind,
some droll sights that I have seen come across my memory.  The sea is a 
place
for wonders and for mysteries.  Why, we see more in a day and a night there,
than you landsmen could contrive to make a whole twelvemonth's wonder of."

     "But you never saw a vampyre, uncle?

     "Well, I don't know that.  I didn't know anything about vampyres till I
came here, but that was my ignorance, you know. There might have been lots 
of
vampyres where I've been, for all I know."

     "Oh, certainly, but as regards this duel, will you wait now until
to-morrow morning, before you take any further steps in the matter?"

     "Till to-morrow morning?"

     "Yes, uncle."

     "Why, only a little while ago, you were all eagerness to have something
done off-hand."

     "Just so; but now I have a particular reason for waiting until to-
morrow
morning."

     "Have you?  Well, as you please, boy -- as you please. Have everything
your own way."

     "You are very kind, uncle; and now I have another favour to ask of 
you."

     "What is it!"

     "Why, you know that Henry Bannerworth receives but a very small sum out
of the whole proceeds of the estate here, which ought, but for his father's
extravagance, to be wholly at his disposal."

     "So I have heard."

     "I am certain he is at present distressed for money, and I have not 
much.
Will you lend me fifty pounds, uncle, until my own affairs are sufficiently
arranged to enable you to pay yourself again?"

     "Will I! of course I will."

     "I wish to offer that sum as an accommodation to Henry. From me, I dare
say he will receive it freely, because he must be convinced how freely it is
offered; and, besides, they look upon me now almost as a member of the 
family,
in consequence of my engagement with Flora."

     "Certainly, and quite correct too; there's a fifty-pound note, my boy;
take it, and do what you like with it, and when you want any more, come to 
me
for it."

     "I know I could trespass thus far on your kindness, uncle."

     "Trespass!  It's no trespass at all."

     "Well, we will not fall out about the terms in which I cannot help
expressing my gratitude to you for many favours. To-morrow, you will arrange
the duel for me."

     "As you please.  I don't altogether like going to that fellow's house
again."

     "Well, then, we can manage, I dare say, by note."

     "Very good.  Do so.  He puts me in mind altogether of a circumstance 
that
happened a good while ago, when I was at sea, and not so old a man as I am
now."

     "Puts you in mind of a circumstance, uncle?"

     "Yes; he's something like a fellow that figured in an affair that I 
know
a good deal about; only I do think as my chap was more mysterious by a d----
d
sight than this one."

     "Indeed!"

     "Oh, dear, yes.  When anything happens in an odd way at sea, it is as 
odd
again as anything that occurs on land, my boy, you may depend."

     "Oh, you only fancy that, uncle, because you have spent so long a time 
at
sea."

     "No, I don't imagine it, you rascal.  What can you have on shore equal 
to
what we have at sea?  Why, the sights that come before us would make you
landsmen's hairs stand up on end, and never come down again."

     "In the ocean, do you mean, that you see those sights, uncle?"

     "To be sure.  I was once in the southern ocean, in a small frigate,
looking out for a seventy-four we were to join company with, when a man at 
the
mast-head sung out that he saw her on the larboard bow.  Well, we thought it
all right enough, and made away that quarter, when what do you think it 
turned
out to be?"

     "I really cannot say."

     "The head of a fish."

     "A fish!"

     "Yes! a d----d deal bigger than the hull of a vessel.  He was swimming
along with his head just what I dare say he considered a shaving or so out 
of
the water."

     "But where were the sails, uncle?"

     "The sails?"

     "Yes; your man at the mast-head must have been a poor seaman not to 
have
missed the sails."

     "Ah, that's one of your shore-going ideas, now.  You know nothing
whatever about it.  I'll tell you where the sails were, master Charley."

     "Well, I should like to know."

     "The spray, then, that he dashed up with a pair of fins that were close
to his head, was in such a quantity, and so white, that they looked just 
like
sails."

     "Oh!"

     "Ah! you may say 'oh!' but we all saw him -- the whole ship's crew; and
we sailed alongside of him for some time, till he got tired of us, and
suddenly dived down, making such a vortex in the water, that the ship shook
again, and seemed for about a minute as if she was inclined to follow him to
the bottom of the sea."

     "And what do you suppose it was, uncle?"

     "How should I know?"

     "Did you ever see it again?"

     "Never; though others have caught a glimpse of him now and then in the
same ocean, but never came so near him as we did, that ever I heard of, at 
all
events.  They may have done so."

     "It is singular!"

     "Singular or not, it's a fool to what I can tell you.  Why I've seen
things that if I were to set about describing them to you, you would say I 
was
making up a romance."

     "Oh, now; it's quite impossible, uncle, anyone could ever suspect you 
of
such a thing."

     "You'd believe me, would you?"

     "Of course I would."

     "Then here goes.  I'll just tell you now of a circumstance that I 
haven't
liked to mention to anybody yet."

     "Indeed! why so?"

     "Because I didn't want to be continually fighting people for not
believing it; but here you have it: --

     We were outward bound; a good ship, a good captain, and good messmates,
you know, go far toward making a prosperous voyage a pleasant and happy one,
and on this occasion we had every reasonable prospect of all.

     Our hands were all tried men -- they had been sailors from infancy; 
none
of your French craft, that serve an apprenticeship and then become land
lubbers again.  Oh, no, they were stanch and true, and loved the sea as the
sluggard loves his bed, or the lover his mistress.

     Ay, and for the matter of that, the love was a more enduring and a more
healthy love, for it increased with years, and made men love one another, 
and
they would stand by each other while they had a limb to life -- while they
were able to chew a quid or wink an eye, leave alone wag a pigtail.

     We were outward bound for Ceylon, with cargo, and were to bring spices
and other matters home from the Indian market.  The ship was new and good -- 
a
pretty craft; she sat like a duck upon the water, and a stiff breeze carried
her along the surface of the waves without your rocking, and pitching, and
tossing, like an old wash-tub at a mill-tail, as I have had the misfortune 
to
sail in more than once afore.

     No, no, we were well laden, and well pleased, and weighed anchor with
light hears and a hearty cheer.

     Away we went down the river, and soon rounded the North Foreland, and
stood out in the Channel.  The breeze was a steady and stiff one, and 
carried
us through the water as though it had been made for us.

     "Jack," said I to a messmate of mine, as he stood looking at the skies,
then at the sails, and finally at the water, with a graver air than I 
thought
was at all consistent with the occasion or circumstances.

     "Well," he replied.

     "What ails you?  You seem as melancholy as if we were about to cast 
lots
who should be eaten first.  Are you well enough?"

     "I am hearty enough, thank Heaven," he said, "but I don't like this
breeze."

     "Don't like the breeze!" said I; "why, mate, it is as good and kind a
breeze as ever filled a sail.  What would you have, a gale?"

     "No, no; I fear that."

     "With such a ship, and such a set of hearty able seamen, I think we 
could
manage to weather out the stiffest gale that ever whistled through a yard."

     "That may be; I hope it is, and I really believe and think so."

     "Then what makes you so infernally mopish and melancholy?"

     "I don't know, but can't help it.  It seems to me as though there was
something hanging over us, and I can't tell what."

     "Yes, there are the colours, Jack, at the masthead they are flying over
us with a hearty breeze."

     "Ah! ah!" said Jack, looking up at the colours, and then went away
without saying anything more, for he had some piece of duty to perform.

     I thought my messmate had something on his mind that caused him to feel
sad and uncomfortable, and I took no more notice of it; indeed, in the 
course
of a day or two he was as merry as any of the rest, and had no more 
melancholy
that I could perceive, but was as comfortable as anybody.

     We had a gale off the coast of Biscay, and rode it out without the loss
of a spar or a yard; indeed, without the slightest accident or rent of any
kind.

     "Now, Jack, what do you think of our vessel?" said I.

     "She's like a duck upon water, rises and falls with the waves, and
doesn't tumble up and down like a hoop over stones."

     "No, no; she goes smoothly and sweetly; she is a gallant craft, and 
this
is her first voyage, and I predict a prosperous one."

     "I hope so," he said.

     Well, we went on prosperously enough for about three weeks; the ocean 
was
as calm and as smooth as a meadow, the breeze light but good, and we stemmed
along majestically over the deep blue waters, and passed coast after coast,
though all around was nothing but the apparently pathless main in sight.

     "A better sailer I never stepped into," said the captain one day; "it
would be a pleasure to live and die in such a vessel."

     Well, as I said, we had been three weeks or thereabouts, when one
morning, after the sun was up and the decks washed, we saw a strange man
sitting on one of the water-casks that were on deck, for, being full, we 
were
compelled to stow some of them on deck.

     You may guess those on deck did a little more than stare at this 
strange
and unexpected apparition.  By jingo, I never saw men open their eyes wider 
in
all my life, nor was I any exception to the rule.  I stared, as well I 
might;
but we said nothing for some minutes, and the stranger looked calmly on us,
and then cocked his eye with a nautical air up at the sky, as if he expected
to receive a twopenny-post letter from St. Michael, or a _billet doux_ from
the Virgin Mary.

     "Where has he come from?" said one of the men in a low tone to his
companion, who was standing by him at that moment.

     "How can I tell?" replied his companion.  "He may have dropped from the
clouds; he seems to be examining the road; perhaps he is going back."

     The stranger sat all this time with the most extreme and provoking
coolness and unconcern; he deigned us but a passing notice, but it was very
slight.

     He was a tall, spare man -- what is termed long and lathy -- but he was
evidently a powerful man.  He had a broad chest, and long, sinewy arms, a
hooked nose, and a black, eagle eye. His hair was curly, but frosted by age;
it seemed as though it had been tinged with white at the extremities, but he
was hale and active otherwise to judge from appearances.

     Notwithstanding all this, there was a singular repulsiveness about him
that I could not imagine the cause, or describe; at the same time there was 
an
air of determination in his wild and singular-looking eyes, and over their
whole there was decidedly an air and an appearance so sinister as to be
positively disagreeable.

     "Well," said I, after we had stood some minutes, "where did you come
from, shipmate?"

     He looked at me and then up at the sky, in a knowing manner.

     "Come, come, that won't do; you have none of Peter Wilkin's wings, and
couldn't come on the aerial dodge; it won't do; how did you get here?"

     He gave me an awful wink, and made a sort of involuntary movement, 
which
jumped him up a few inches, and he bumped down again on the water-cask.

     "That's as much as to say," thought I, "that he's sat himself on it."

     "I'll go and inform the captain," says I, "of this affair; he'll hardly
believe me when I tell him, I am sure."

     So saying, I left the deck and went to the cabin, where the captain was
at breakfast, and related to him what I had seen respecting the stranger.  
The
captain looked at me with an air of disbelief, and said, --

     "What? -- do you mean to say there's a man on board we haven't seen
before?"

     "Yes, I do, Captain,  I never saw him afore, and he's sitting beating 
his
heels on the water-cask on deck."

     "The devil!"

     "He is, I assure you, sir; and he won't answer any questions."

     "I'll see to that.  I'll see if I can't make the lubber say something,
providing his tongue's not cut out.  But how came he on board?  Confound it,
he can't be the devil, and dropped from the moon."

     "Don't know, captain," said I.  "He is evil-looking enough, to my mind,
to be the father of evil, but it's ill bespeaking attentions from that 
quarter
at any time."

     "Go on, lad:  I'll come up after you."

     I left the cabin, and I heard the captain coming up after me.  When I 
got
on deck, I saw he had not moved from the place where I left him.  There was 
a
general commotion among the crew when they heard of the occurrence, and all
crowded round him, save the man at the helm who had to remain at his post.

     The captain now came forward, and the men fell a little back as he
approached.

     For a moment the captain stood silent, attentively examining the
stranger, who was excessively cool, and stood the scrutiny with the same
unconcern that he would had the captain been looking at his watch.

     "Well, my man," said the captain, "how did you come here?"

     "I'm part of the cargo," he said, with an indescribable leer.

     "Part of the cargo be d----d!" said the captain, in sudden rage, for he
thought the stranger was coming his jokes too strong, "I know you are not in
the bills of lading."

     "I'm contraband," replied the stranger; "and my uncle's the great cham 
of
Tartary."

     The captain stared, as well he might, and did not speak for some 
minutes;
all the while the stranger kept kicking his heels against the water-casks 
and
squinting up at the skies; it made us feel very queer.

     "Well, I must confess you are not in the regular way of trading."

     "Oh, no," said the stranger; "I am contraband-- entirely contraband."

     "And how did you come on board?"

     At this question the stranger again looked curiously up at the skies, 
and
continued to do so for more than a minute; he then turned his gaze upon the
captain.

     "No, no," said the captain: "Eloquent dumb show won't do with me; you
didn't come, like Mother Shipton, upon a birch broom.  How did you come on
board my vessel?"

     "I walked on board," said the stranger.

     "You walked on board; and where did you conceal yourself?"

     "Below."

     "Very good; and why didn't you stay below altogether?"

     "Because I wanted fresh air.  I'm in a delicate state of health, you 
see;
it doesn't do to stay in a confined place too long."

     "Confound the binnacle!" said the captain; it was his usual oath when
anything bothered him, and he could not make it out. "Confound the binnacle!
-- what a delicate-looking animal you are.  I wish you had stayed where you
were; your delicacy would have been all the same to me.  Delicate, indeed!"

     "Yes, very," said the stranger, coolly.

     There was something so comic in the assertion of his delicateness of
health, that we should have all laughed; but we were somewhat scared, and 
had
not the inclination.

     "How have you lived since you came on board?" inquired the captain.

     "Very indifferently."

     "But how?  What have you eaten? and what have you drank?"

     "Nothing; I assure you.  All I did while I was below was-- "

     "What?"

     "Why, I sucked my thumbs like a polar bear in its winter quarters."

     And as he spoke the stranger put his two thumbs into his mouth, and
extraordinary thumbs they were, too, for each would have filled an ordinary
man's mouth.

     "These," said the stranger, pulling them out, and gazing at them
wistfully, and with a deep sigh he continued, --

     "These were thumbs at one time; but they are nothing now to what they
were."

     "Confound the binnacle!" muttered the captain to himself, and then he
added, aloud, --

     "It's cheap living, however, but where are you going to, and why did 
you
come aboard?"

     "I wanted a cheap cruise, and I am gong there and back."

     "Why, that's where we are going," said the captain.

     "Then we are brothers," exclaimed the stranger, hopping off the water-
cask like a kangaroo, and bounding toward the captain, holding out his hand 
as
though he would have shaken hands with him.

     "No, no," said the captain; "I can't do it."

     "Can't do it!" exclaimed the stranger, angrily.  "What do you mean?"

     "That I can't have anything to do with contraband articles; I am a fair
trader, and do all above board.  I haven't a chaplain on board, or he should
offer up prayers for your preservation, and the recovery of your health, 
which
seems so delicate."

     "That be-- "

     "The strange didn't finish the sentence; he merely screwed his mouth up
into an incomprehensible shape, and puffed out a lot of breath, with some
force, and which sounded very much like a whistle; but, oh, what thick 
breath
he had, it was as much like smoke as anything I ever saw, and so my shipmate
said.

     "I say, captain," said the stranger, as he saws him pacing the deck.

     "Well."

     "Just send me up some beef and biscuit, and some coffee royal-- be sure
it's royal, do you hear, because I'm partial to brandy, it's the only good
thing there is on earth."

     I shall not easily forget the captain's look as he turned towards the
stranger, and gave his huge shoulders a shrug, as much as to say, --

     "Well, I can't help it now; he's here, and I can't throw him 
overboard."

     The coffee, beef, and biscuit were sent him, and the stranger seemed to
eat them with great _gout_, and drank the coffee with much relish, and
returned the things saying,

     "Your captain is an excellent cook; give him my compliments."

     I thought the captain would think that was but a left-handed 
compliment,
and look more angry than pleased, but no notice was taken of it.

     It was strange, but this man had impressed upon all in the vessel some
singular notion of his being more than he should be -- more than a mere
mortal, and not one endeavored to interfere with him; the captain was a 
stout
and dare devil a fellow as you would well meet with, yet he seemed tacitly 
to
acknowledge more than he would say, for he never after took any further 
notice
of the stranger nor he of him.

     They had barely any conversation, simply a civil word when they first
met, and so forth; but there was little or no conversation of any kind 
between
them.

     The stranger slept upon deck, and lived upon deck entirely; he never 
once
went below after we saw him, and his own account of being below so long.

     This was very well, but the night-watch did not enjoy his society, and
would have willingly dispensed with it at that hour so particularly lonely 
and
dejected upon the broad ocean, and perhaps a thousand miles away from the
nearest point of land.

     At this dread and lonely hour, when no sound reaches the ear and 
disturbs
the wrapt stillness of the night, save the whistling of the wind through the
cordage, or an occasional dash of water against the vessel's side, the
thoughts of the sailor are fixed on far distant objects -- his own native 
land
and the friends and loved ones he has left behind him.

     He then thinks of the wilderness before, behind, and around him; of the
immense body of water, almost in places bottomless; gazing upon such a 
scene,
and with thoughts as strange and indefinite as the very boundless expanse
before him it is no wonder if he should become superstitious; the time and
place would indeed unbidden, conjure up thoughts and feelings of a fearful
character and intensity.

     The stranger at such times would occupy his favourite seat upon the 
water
cask and looking up at the sky and then on the ocean, and between whiles he
would whistle a strange, wild, unknown melody.

     The flesh of the sailors used to creep up in knots and bumps when they
heard it; the wind used to whistle as an accompaniment and pronounce fearful
sounds to their ears.

     The wind had been highly favourable from the first, and since the
stranger had been discovered it had blown fresh, and we went along at a 
rapid
rate, stemming the water, and dashing the spray off from the bows, and 
cutting
the water like a shark.

     This was very singular to us, we couldn't understand it, neither could
the captain, and we looked very suspiciously at the stranger, and wished him
at the bottom, for the freshness of the wind now became a gale, and yet the
ship came through the water steadily, and away we went before the wind, as 
if
the devil drove us; and mind I don't mean to say he didn't.

     The gale increased to a hurricane, and though we had not a stitch of
canvass out, yet we drove before the gale as if we had been shot out of the
mouth of a gun.

     The stranger still sat on the water casks, and all night long he kept 
up
his infernal whistle.  Now, sailors don't like to hear any one whistle when
there's such a gale blowing over their heads -- it's like asking for more; 
but
he would persist, and the louder and stronger the wind blew, the louder he
whistled.

     At length there came a storm of rain, lightning, and wind. We were 
tossed
mountains high, and the foam rose over the vessel, and often entirely over 
our
heads, and the men were lashed to their posts to prevent being washed way.

     But the stranger still lay on the water casks, kicking his heels and
whistling his infernal tune, always the same.  He wasn't washed away nor 
moved
by the action of the water; indeed, we heartily hoped and expected to see 
both
him and the water cask floated overboard at every minute; but, as the 
captain
said, --

     "Confound the binnacle! the old water tub seems as if it were screwed 
on
to the deck, and won't move off and he on the top of it."

     There was a strong inclination to throw him overboard, and the men
conversed in low whispers, and came round the captain, saying, --

     "We have come, captain, to ask you what you think of this strange man 
who
has come so mysteriously on board?"

     "I can't tell you what to think, lads; he's past thinking about-- he's
something above my comprehension altogether, I promise you."

     "Well, then, we are thinking much of the same thing, captain."

     "What do you mean?"

     "That he ain't exactly one of our sort."

     "No, he's no sailor, certainly; and yet, for a land lubber, he's about 
as
rum a customer as ever I met with."

     "So he is, sir."

     "He stands salt water well; and I must say that I couldn't lay a top of
those water casks in that style very well."

     "Nor nobody amongst us, sir."

     "Well, then, he's in nobody's way, is he? -- nobody wants to take his
berth, I suppose?"

     The men looked at each other somewhat blank; they didn't understand the
meaning at all -- far from it; and the idea of any one's wanting to take the
stranger's place on the water casks was so outrageously ludicrous that at 
any
other time they would have considered it a devilish good joke and have never
ceased laughing at it.

     He paused some minutes, and then one of them said, --

     "It isn't that we envy him his berth, captain, 'cause nobody else could
live there for a moment.  Any one amongst us that had been there would have
been washed overboard a thousand times over."

     "So they would," said the captain.

     "Well, sir, he's more than us."

     "Very likely; but how can I help that?"

     "We think he's the main cause of all this racket in the heavens -- the
storm and hurricane; and that, in short, if he remains much longer we shall
all sink."

     "I am sorry for it.  I don't think we are in any danger, and had the
strange being any power to prevent it, he would assuredly do so, lest he got
drowned."

     "But we think if he were thrown over board all would be well."

     "Indeed!"

     "Yes, captain, you may depend upon it he's the cause of all the 
mischief.
Throw him over board and that's all we want."

     "I shall not throw him overboard, even if I could do such a thing; and 
I
am by no means sure of anything of the kind."

     "We do not ask it, sir."

     "What do you desire?"

     "Leave to throw him over board-- it is to save our own lives."

     "I can't let you do any such thing; he's in nobody's way."

     "But he's always a whistling.  Only hark now, and in such a hurricane 
as
this, it is dreadful to think of it.  What else can we do, sir? -- he's not
human."

     At this moment, the stranger's whistling came clear upon their ears;
there was the same wild, unearthly notes as before, but the cadences were
stronger, and there was a supernatural clearness in all the tones.

     "There now," said another, "he's kicking the water cask with his 
heels."

     "Confound the binnacle!" said the captain; "it sounds like short peals 
of
thunder.  Go and talk to him, lads."

     "And if that won't do, sir, may we-- "

     "Don't ask me any questions.  I don't think a score of the best men 
that
were ever born could move him."

     "I don't mind trying," said one.

     Upon this the whole of the men moved to the spot where the water casks
were standing and the stranger lay.

     There he was, whistling like fury, and, at the same time, beating his
heels to the tune against the empty casks.  We came up to him, and he took 
no
notice of us at all, but kept on in the same way.

     "Hilloa!" shouted one.

     "Hilloa!" shouted another.

     No notice, however, was taken of us, and one of our number, a big,
herculean fellow, an Irishman, seized him by the leg, either to make him get
up, or, as we thought, to give him a lift over our heads into the sea. 
However, he had scarcely got his fingers round the calf of the leg, when the
stranger pinched his leg so tight against the water cask, that he could not
move, and was as effectually pinned as if he had been nailed there.  The
stranger, after he had finished a bar of the music, rose gradually to a
sitting posture, and without the aid of his hands, and looking the unlucky
fellow in the face, he said, --

     "Well, what do you want?"

     "My hand," said the fellow.

     "Take it then," he said.

     He did take it, and we saw that there was blood on it.

     The stranger stretched out his left hand, and taking him by the breech,
he lifted him, without any effort, upon the water- cask beside him.

     We all stared at this, and couldn't help it; and we were quite 
convinced
we could not throw him over board but he would probably have no difficulty 
in
throwing us over board.

     "Well, what do you want?" he again exclaimed to us all.

      We looked at one another, and had scarce courage to speak; at length I
said, --

     "We wish you to leave off whistling."

     "Leave off whistling!" he said.  "And why should I do anything of the
kind?"

     Because it brings the wind."

     "Ha! ha! why that's the very reason I am whistling, to bring the wind."

     "But we don't want so much."

     "Pho! pho! you don't know what's good for you -- it's a beautiful 
breeze,
and not a bit too stiff."

     "It's a hurricane."

     "Nonsense."

     "But it is."

     "Now you see how I'll prove you are wrong in a minute.  You see my 
hair,
don't you?" he said, after he took off his cap. "Very well, look now."

     He got up on the water-cask, and stood bolt upright; and running his
fingers through his hair, made it all stand straight on end.

     "Confound the binnacle!" said the captain, "if ever I saw the like."

     "There," said the stranger, triumphantly, "don't tell me there's any 
wind
to signify; don't you see, it doesn't even move one of my grey hairs; and if
it blew as hard as you say, I am certain it would move a hair."

     "Confound the binnacle!" muttered the captain as he walked away.  "D--n
the cabouse, if he ain't older than I am-- he's too many for me and 
everybody
else."

     "Are you satisfied?"

     What could we say? -- we turned away and left the place, and stood at 
our
quarters-- there was no help for it-- we were compelled to grin and abide by
it.

     As soon as we had left the place he put his cap on again and sat down 
on
the watercasks, and then took leave of his prisoner, whom he set free, and
there lay at full length on his back, with his legs hanging down.  Once more
he began to whistle most furiously, and beat time with his feet.

     For full three weeks did he continue at this game night and day, 
without
any interruption, save such as he required to consume enough coffee royal,
junk and biscuit, as would have served three hearty men.

     Well, about that time, one night the whistling ceased and he began to
sing-- oh! it was singing-- such a voice! Gog and Magog in Guildhall, 
London,
when they spoke were nothing to him-- it was awful; but the wind calmed down
to a fresh and stiff breeze.  He continued at this game for three whole days
and nights, and on the fourth it ceased, and when we went to take his coffee
royal to him he was gone.

     We hunted about everywhere, but he was entirely gone, and in three 
weeks
after we safely cast anchor, having performed our voyage in a good month 
under
the usual time; and had it been an old vessel she would have leaked and
started like a tub from the straining; however, we were glad enough to get 
in,
and were curiously inquisitive as to what was put in our vessel to come back
with, for as the captain said, --

     "Confound the binnacle!  I'll have no more contraband articles if I can
help it."

 Next Time: The Meeting By Moonlight in the Park.  The Turret Window in the
 Hall. -- The Letters.



        Chapter XXVI.

THE MEETING AT MOONLIGHT IN THE PARK. -- THE TURRET WINDOW IN THE HALL. -- 
THE
LETTERS.


     The old admiral showed such a strong disposition to take offence at
Charles if he should presume, for a moment, to doubt the truth of the
narrative than was thus communicated to him, that the latter would not anger
him by so doing, but confined his observations upon it to saying that he
considered it was very wonderful, and very extraordinary, and so on, which
very well satisfied the old man.

     The day was now, however, getting far advanced, and Charles Holland 
began
to think of his engagement with the vampyre.  He read and read the letter 
over
and over again, but he could not come to a correct conclusion as to whether 
it
intended to imply that he, Sir Francis Varney, would wish to fight him at 
the
hour and place mentioned, or merely give him a meeting as a preliminary 
step.

     He was rather, on the whole, inclined to think that some explanation
would be offered by Varney, but at all events he persevered in his
determination of going well armed, lest anything in the shape of treachery
should be intended.

     As nothing of any importance occurred now in the interval of time till
nearly midnight, we will at once step to that time, and our readers will
suppose it to be a quarter to twelve o'clock at night, and young Charles
Holland on the point of leaving the house, to keep his appointment by the
pollard oak, with the mysterious Sir Francis Varney.

     He placed his loaded pistols conveniently in his pocket, so that at a
moment's notice he could lay hands on them, and then wrapping himself up in 
a
travelling cloak he had brought with him to Bannerworth Hall, he prepared to
leave his chamber.

     The moon still shone, although now somewhat on the wane, and although
there were certainly many clouds in the sky they were but of a light fleecy
character, and very little interrupted the rays of light that came from the
nearly full disc of the moon.

     From his window he could not perceive the spot in the park where he was
to meet Varney, because the room in which he was occupied not a sufficiently
high place in the house to enable him to look over a belt of trees that
stopped the view.  From almost any of the upper windows the pollard oak 
could
be seen.

     It so happened now that the admiral had been placed in a room 
immediately
above the one occupied by his nephew, and, as his mind was full of how he
should manage with regard to arranging the preliminaries of the duel between
Charles and Varney on the morrow, he found it difficult to sleep; and after
remaining in bed about twenty minutes, and finding that each moment he was
only getting more and more restless, he adopted a course which he always did
under such circumstances.

     He rose and dressed himself again, intending to sit up for an hour and
then turn into bed and try a second time to get to sleep.  But he had no 
means
of getting a light, so he drew the heavy curtain from before the window, and
let in as much of the moonlight as he could.

     This window commanded a most beautiful and extensive view, for from it
the eye could carry completely over the tops of the tallest trees, so that
there was no interruption whatever to the prospect, which was as extensive 
as
it was delightful.

     Even the admiral, who never would confess to seeing much beauty in
scenery where water formed not a large portion of it, could not resist 
opening
his window and looking out, with a considerable degree of admiration, upon
wood and dale, as they were illuminated by the moon's rays, softened, and
rendered, if anything, more beautiful by the light vapours, though which 
they
had to struggle to make their way.

     Charles Holland, in order to avoid the likelihood of meeting with any 
one
who would question him as to where he was going, determined upon leaving his
room by the balcony, which, as we are aware, presented ample facilities for
his so doing.

     He cast a glance at the portrait in the panel before he left the
apartment, and then saying --

     "For you, dear Flora, for you I essay this meeting with the fearful
original of that portrait," he immediately opened his window, and stepped 
out
on to the balcony.

     Young and active as was Charles Holland, to descend from that balcony
presented to him no difficulty whatever, and he was, in a very few moments,
safe in the garden of Bannerworth Hall.

     He never thought, for a moment, to look up, or he would, in an instant,
have seen the white head of his old uncle, as it was projected over the sill
of the window of his chamber.

     The drop of Charles from the balcony of his window, just made 
sufficient
noise to attract the admiral's attention, and, then, before he could think 
of
making any alarm, he saw Charles walking hastily across a grass plot, which
was sufficiently in the light of the moon to enable the admiral at once to
recognise him, and leave no sort of doubt as to his positive identity.

     Of course, upon discovering that it was Charles, the necessity for 
making
an alarm no longer existed, and, indeed, not knowing what it was that had
induced him to leave his chamber, a moment's reflection suggested to him the
propriety of not even calling to Charles, lest he should defeat some 
discovery
which he might be about to make.

     "He has heard something, or seen something," thought the admiral, "and 
is
gone to find out what it is.  I only wish I was with him; but up here I can 
do
nothing at all, that's quite clear."

     Charles, he saw, walked very rapidly, and like a man who has some fixed
destination which he wishes to reach as quickly as possible.

     When he dived among the trees which skirted one side of the flower
gardens, the admiral was more puzzled than ever, and he said --

     "Now where on earth is he off to?  He is fully dressed and has his 
cloak
about him."

     After a few moments' reflection he decided that, having seen something
suspicious, Charles must have got up, and dressed himself, to fathom it.

     The moment this idea became fairly impressed upon his mind, he left his
bedroom, and descended to where one of the brothers he knew was sitting up,
keeping watch during the night.  It was Henry who was so on guard; and when
the admiral came into the room, he uttered an expression of surprise to find
him up, for it was now some time past twelve o'clock.

     "I have come to tell you that Charles has left the house," said the
admiral.

     "Left the house?"

     "Yes; I saw him just now go across the garden."

     "And you are sure it was he?"

     "Quite sure.  I saw him by the moonlight cross the green plot."

     "Then you may depend he has seen or heard something, and gone alone to
find out what it is rather than give any alarm."

     "That is just what I think."

     "It must be so.  I will follow him, if you can show me exactly which 
way
he went."

     "That I can easily.  And in case I should have made any mistake, which 
it
is not at all likely, we can go to his room first and see if it is empty."

     "A good thought, certainly, that will at once put an end to all doubt
upon the question."

     They both immediately proceeded to Charles's room, and then the 
admiral's
accuracy of identification of his nephew was immediately proved by finding
that Charles was not there, and that the window was wide open.

     "You see I am right," said the admiral.

     "You are," cried Henry; "but what have we here?"

     "Where?"

     "Here on the dressing-table.  Here are no less than three letters, all
laid as if on purpose to catch the eye of the first one who might enter the
room."

     "Indeed!"

     "You perceive them?"

     Henry held them to the light, and after a moment's inspection of them, 
he
said, in a voice of much surprise, --

     "Good God! what is the meaning of this?"

     "The meaning of what?"

     "The letters are addressed to parties in the house here.  Do you not
see?"

     "To whom?"

     "One to Admiral Bell -- "

     "The deuce!"

     "Another to me, and the third to my sister Flora.  There is some new
mystery here."

     The admiral looked at the superscription of one of the letters which 
was
handed to him in silent amazement.  Then he cried, --

     "Set down the light, and let us read them."

     Henry did so, and then they simultaneously opened the epistles which 
were
severally addressed to them.  There was a silence, as of the very grave, for
some moments, and then the old admiral staggered to a seat, as he exclaimed, 
--


     "Am I dreaming -- am I dreaming?"

     "Is this possible?" said Henry, in a voice of deep emotion, as he 
allowed
the note addressed to him to drop on to the floor.

     "D--n it, what does yours say?" cried the old admiral in a louder tone.

     "Read it -- what says yours?"

     "Read it -- I am amazed."

     The letters were exchanged, and read by each with the same breathless
attention they had bestowed upon their own; after which, they both looked at
each other in silence, pictures of amazement, and the most absolute state of
bewilderment.

     Not to keep our readers in suspense, we at once transcribe each of 
these
letters.

     The one to the admiral contained these words, --

     "MY DEAR UNCLE,

     "Of course you will perceive the prudence of keeping this letter to
yourself, but the fact is, I have now made up my mind to leave Bannerworth
Hall.

     "Flora Bannerworth is not now the person she was when first I knew her
and loved her.  Such being the case, and she having altered, not I, she 
cannot
accuse me of fickleness.

     "I still love the Flora Bannerworth I first knew, but I cannot make my
wife one who is subject to the visitations of a vampyre.

     "I have remained here long enough now to satisfy myself that this 
vampyre
business is no delusion.  I am quite convinced that it is a positive fact, 
and
that, after death, Flora will herself become one of the horrible existences
known by that name.

     "I will communicate to you from the first large city on the continent
whither I am going, at which I make any stay, and in the meantime, make what
excuses you like at Bannerworth Hall, which I advise you to leave as quickly
as you can, and believe me to be, my dear uncle, yours truly,

                             "CHARLES HOLLAND

     Henry's letter was this: --

     "MY DEAR SIR,

     "If you calmly and dispassionately consider the painful and distressing
circumstances in which your family are placed, I am sure that, far from
blaming me for the step which this note will announce to you I have taken, 
you
will be the first to give me credit for acting with an amount of prudence 
and
foresight which was highly necessary under the circumstances.

     "If the supposed visits of the vampyre to your sister Flora had turned
out, as at first I hoped they would, a delusion, and been in any 
satisfactory
manner explained away I should certainly have felt pride and pleasure in
fulfilling my engagement to that young lady.

     "You must, however, yourself feel that the amount of evidence in favour
of a belief that an actual vampyre has visited Flora, enforces a conviction 
of
its truth.

     "I cannot, therefore, make her my wife under such very singular
circumstances.

     "Perhaps you may blame me for not taking at once advantage of the
permission given me to forego my engagement when first I came to your house;
but the fact is, I did not then in the least believe in the existence of the
vampyre, but since a positive conviction of that most painful fact has now
forced itself upon me, I beg to decline the honour of an alliance which I 
had
at one time looked forward to with the most considerable satisfaction.

     "I shall be on the continent as fast as conveyances can take me,
therefore, should you entertain any romantic notions of calling me to an
account for a course of proceeding I think perfectly and fully justifiable,
you will not find me.

     "Accept my assurances of my respect of yourself and pity for your 
sister,
and believe me to be, my dear sir, your sincere friend,

                           "CHARLES HOLLAND."

     These two letters might well make the admiral stare at Henry 
Bannerworth,
and Henry stare at him.

     An occurrence so utterly and entirely unexpected by both of them, was
enough to make them doubt the evidence of their own senses.  But there were
the letters, as a damning evidence of the outrageous fact, and Charles 
Holland
was gone.

     It was the admiral who first recovered from the stunning effect of the
epistles, and he, with a gesture of perfect fury, exclaimed, --

     "The scoundrel! -- the cold-blooded villain!  I renounce him for ever! 
he
is no nephew of mine; he is some d----d imposter! Nobody with a dash of my
family blood in his veins would have acted so to save himself from a 
thousand
deaths."

     "Who shall we trust now," said Henry, "when those whom we take to our
inmost hearts deceive us thus?  This is the greatest shock I have yet
received.  If there be a pang greater than another, surely it is to be found
in the faithlessness and heartlessness of one we loved and trusted."

     "He is a scoundrel!" roared the admiral.  "D--n him, he'll die on a
dunghill, and that's too good a place for him.  I cast him off-- I'll find 
him
out, and old as I am, I'll fight him-- I'll wring his neck, the rascal, and 
as
for poor dear Miss Flora, God bless her!  I'll-- I'll marry her myself and
make her an admiral. -- I'll marry her myself.  Oh, that I should be uncle 
to
such a rascal!"

     "Calm yourself," said Henry, "no one can blame you."

     "Yes, you can; I had no right to be his uncle, and I was an old fool to
love him."

     The old man sat down, and his voice became broken with emotion as he
said, --

     "Sir, I tell you I would have died willingly rather than this should 
have
happened.  This will kill me now, -- I shall die now of shame and grief."

     Tears gushed from the admiral's eyes, and the sight of the noble old
man's emotion did much to calm the anger of Henry, which, although he said 
but
little, was boiling at his heart like a volcano.

     "Admiral Bell," he said, you have nothing to do with this business; we
cannot blame you for the heartlessness of another. I have but one favour to
ask of you."

     "What-- what can I do?"

     "Say no more about him at all."

     "I can't help saying something about him.  You ought to turn me out of
the house."

     "Heaven forbid!  What for?"

     "Because I'm his uncle-- his d----d old fool of an uncle, that has
always thought so much of him."

     "Nay, my good sir, that was a fault on the right side, and cannot
discredit you.  I though him the most perfect of human beings."

     "Oh, if I could but have guessed this."

     "It was impossible.  Such duplicity never was equalled in this world-- 
it
was impossible to foresee it."

     "Hold-- hold! did he give you fifty pounds?

     "What?"

     "Did he give you fifty pounds?"

     "Give me fifty pounds!  Most decidedly not; what made you think of such 
a
thing?"

     "Because to-day he borrowed fifty pounds of me, he said, to lend to 
you."

     "I never heard of the transaction until this moment."

     "The villain!"

     "No doubt, sir, he wanted that amount to expedite his progress abroad."

     "Well, now, damme, if an angel had come to me and said 'Hiloa!  Admiral
Bell, your nephew, Charles Holland, is a thundering rogue,' I should have 
said
'You're a liar!'"

     "This is fighting against facts, my dear sir.  He is gone-- mention him
no more; forget him, as I shall endeavour myself to do, and persuade my poor
sister to do."

     "Poor girl! what can we say to her?"

     "Nothing, but give her all the letters, and let her be at once 
satisfied
of the worthlessness of him she loved."

     "The best way.  Her woman's pride will then come to her help."

     "I hope it will.  She is of an honourable race, and I am sure she will
not condescend to shed a tear for such a man as Charles Holland has proved
himself to be."

     "D--n him, I'll find him out, and make him fight you.  He shall give 
you
satisfaction."

     "No, no."

     "No?  But he shall."

     "I cannot fight with him."

     "You cannot?"

     "Certainly not.  He is too far beneath me now.  I cannot fight on
honourable terms with one whom I despise as too dishonourable to contend 
with.
I have nothing now but silence and contempt."

     "I have though, for I'll break his neck when I see him, or he shall 
break
mine.  The villain!  I'm ashamed to stay here, my young friend."

     "How mistaken a view you take of this matter, my dear sir. As Admiral
Bell, a gentleman, a brave officer, and a man of the purest and most
unblemished honour, you confer a distinction upon us by your presence here."

     The admiral wrung Henry by the hand, as he said, --

     "To-morrow-- wait until to-morrow; we will talk over this matter
to-morrow-- I cannot to-night, I have not patience; but to-morrow, my dear
boy, we will have it all out.  God bless you. Good night.

 Next Time: The Nobel Confidence of Flora Bannerworth in Her Lover. -- Her
 Opinion of the Three Letters. -- The Admiral's Admiration.




                               Chapter XXVII.

THE NOBLE CONFIDENCE OF FLORA BANNERWORTH IN HER LOVER.  -- HER OPINION OF 
THE
THREE LETTERS. -- THE ADMIRAL'S ADMIRATION.


     To describe the feelings of Henry Bannerworth on the occasion of this
apparent defalcation from the path of rectitude and honour by his friend, as
he had fondly imagined Charles Holland to be, would be next to impossible.

     If, as we have taken occasion to say, it be a positive fact, that a 
noble
and a generous mind feels more acutely any heartlessness of this description
from one on whom it has placed implicit confidence, than the most deliberate
and wicked of injuries from absolute strangers, we can easily conceive that
Henry Bannerworth was precisely the person to feel most acutely the conduct
whence all circumstances appeared to fix upon Charles Holland, upon whose
faith, truth, and honour, he would have staked his very existence but a few
short hours before.

     With such a bewildered sensation that he scarcely knew where he walked 
or
whither to betake himself, did he repair to his own chamber, and there he
strove, with what energy he was able to bring to the task, to find out some
excuse, if he could, for Charles's conduct.  But he could find none.  View 
it
in what light he would, it presented by a picture of the most heartless
selfishness it had ever been his lot to encounter.

     The tone of the letters, too, which Charles had written, materially
aggravated the moral delinquency of which he had been guilty; better, far
better, had he not attempted an excuse at all than have attempted such 
excuses
as were there put down in those epistles.

     A more cold blooded, dishonourable proceeding could not possibly be
conceived.

     It would appear, that while he entertained a doubt with regard to the
reality of the visitation of the vampyre to Flora Bannerworth, he had been
willing to take to himself abundance of credit for the most honourable
feelings, and to induce a belief in the minds of all that an exalted feeling
of honour, as well as a true affection that would know no change, kept him 
at
the feet of her whom he loved.

     Like some braggart, who, when there is no danger, is a very hero, but
who, the moment he feels convinced he will be actually and truly called upon
for an exhibition of his much-vaunted prowess, had Charles Holland deserted
the beautiful girl, who, if anything, had now certainly, in her misfortunes, 
a
far higher claim upon his kindly feeling than before.

     Henry could not sleep, although, at the request of George, who offered 
to
keep watch for him the remainder of the night, he attempted to do so.

     He in vain said to himself, "I will banish from my mind this most
unworthy subject.  I have told Admiral Bell that contempt is the only 
feeling
I can now have for his nephew, and yet I now find myself dwelling upon him,
and upon his conduct, with a perseverance which is a foe to my repose."

     At length came the welcome and beautiful light of day, and Henry rose
fevered and unrefreshed.

     His first impulse now was to hold a consultation with his brother 
George,
as to what was to be done, and George advised that Mr. Marchdale, who as yet
knew nothing of the matter, should be immediately informed of it, and
consulted, as being probably better qualified than either of them to come to 
a
just, a cool, and a reasonable opinion upon the painful circumstance, which 
it
could not be expected that either of them would be able to view calmly.

     "Let it be so, then," said Henry; "Mr. Marchdale shall decide for us."

     They at once sought this friend of the family, who was in his own
bed-room, and when Henry knocked at the door, Marchdale opened it hurriedly,
eagerly inquiring what was the matter.

     "There is no alarm," said Henry.  "We have only come to tell you of a
circumstance which has occurred during the night, and which will somewhat
surprise you."

     "Nothing calamitous, I hope?"

     "Vexatious; and yet, I think it is a matter upon which we ought almost 
to
congratulate ourselves.  Read those two letters, and give us your candid
opinion upon them."

     Henry placed in Mr. Marchdale's hands the letter addressed to himself, 
as
well as that to the admiral.

     Marchdale read them both with marked attention, but he did not exhibit 
in
his countenance so much surprise as regret.

     When he had finished, Henry said to him, --

     "Well, Marchdale, what think you of this new and extraordinary episode 
in
our affairs?"

     "My dear young friends," said Marchdale, in a voice of great emotion, 
"I
know not what to say to you.  I have no doubt but that you are both of you
much astonished at the receipt of these letters, and equally so at the 
sudden
absence of Charles Holland."

     "And are not you?"

     "Not so much as you, doubtless, are.  The fact is, I never did 
entertain
a favourable opinion of the young man, and he knew it.  I have been 
accustomed
to the study of human nature under a variety of aspects; I have made it a
matter of deep, and I may add, sorrowful, contemplation, to study and remark
those minor shades of character which commonly escape observation wholly. 
And,
I repeat, I always had a bad opinion of Charles Holland, which he guessed, 
and
hence he conceived a hatred to me, which more than once, as you cannot but
remember, showed itself in little acts of opposition and hostility."

     "You much surprise me."

     "I expected to do so.  But you cannot help remembering that at one time 
I
was on the point of leaving here solely on his account."

     "You were so."

     "Indeed I should have done so, but that I reasoned with myself upon the
subject, and subdued the impulse of the anger which some years ago, when I 
had
not seen so much of the world, would have guided me."

     "But why did you not impart to us your suspicions?  We should at least,
then, have been prepared for such a contingency as has occurred."

     "Place yourself in my position, and then ask yourself what you would 
have
done.  Suspicion is one of those hideous things which all men would be most
specially careful not only how they entertain at all, but how they give
expression to.  Besides, whatever may be the amount of one's own internal
conviction with regard to the character of any one, there is just a
possibility that one may be wrong."

     "True, true."

     "That possibility ought to keep any one silent who has nothing but
suspicion to go upon, however cautious it may make him, as regards his
dealings with the individual.  I only suspected from little minute shades of
character, that would peep out in spite of him, that Charles Holland was not
the honourable man he would fain have had everybody believe him to be."

     "And had you from the first such a feeling?"

     "I had."

     "It is very strange."

     "Yes; and what is more strange still, is that he from the first seemed 
to
know it; and despite a caution which I could see he always kept uppermost in
his thought, he could not help speaking tartly to me at times."

     "I have noticed that," said George.

     "You may depend it is a fact," added Marchdale, "that nothing so much
excites the deadly and desperate hatred of a man who is acting a 
hypocritical
part, as the suspicion, well grounded or not, that another sees and
understands the secret impulses of his dishonourable heart."

     "I cannot blame you, or any one else, Mr. Marchdale," said Henry, "that
you did not give utterance to your secret thought, but I do wish that you 
had
done so."

     "Nay, dear Henry," replied Mr. Marchdale, "believe me, I have made this
matter a subject of deep thought, and have abundance of reasons why I ought
not to have spoken to you upon the subject."

     "Indeed!"

     "Indeed I have, and not among the least important is the one, that if I
had acquainted you with my suspicions, you would have found yourself in the
painful position of acting a hypocritical part yourself towards this Charles
Holland, for you must either have kept the secret that he was suspected, or
you must have shewn it to him by your behaviour."

     "Well, well, I dare say, Marchdale, you acted for the best. What shall 
we
do now?"

     "Can you doubt?"

     "I was thinking of letting Flora at once know the absolute and complete
worthlessness of her lover, so that she could have no difficulty in at once
tearing herself from him by the assistance of the natural pride which would
surely come to her aid, upon finding herself so much deceived."

     "The test may be possible."

     "You think so?"

     "I do, indeed."

     "Here is a letter, which of course remains unopened, addressed to Flora
by Charles Holland.  The admiral rather thought it would hurt her feelings 
to
deliver her such an epistle, but I must confess I am of the contrary opinion
upon that point, and think now the more evidence she has of the utter
worthlessness of him who professed to love her with so much disinterested
affection, the better it will be for her."

     "You could not, possibly, Henry, have taken a more sensible view of the
subject."

     "I am glad you agree with me."

     "No reasonable man could do otherwise, and from what I have seen of
Admiral Bell, I am sure, upon reflection, he will be of the same opinion."

     "Then it shall be so.  The first shock to poor Flora may be severe, but
we shall then have the consolation of knowing that it is the only one, and
that in knowing the very worst, she has no more on that score to apprehend. 
Alas, alas! the hand of misfortune now appears to have pressed heavily upon 
us
indeed. What in the name of all that is unlucky and disastrous, will happen
next, I wonder?"

     "What can happen?" said Marchdale; "I think you have now got rid of the
greatest evil of all-- a false friend."

     "We have, indeed."

     "Go, then, to Flora; assure her that in the affection of others who 
know
no falsehood, she will find a solace from every ill.  Assure her that there
are hearts that will place themselves between her and every misfortune."

     Mr. Marchdale was much affected as he spoke.  Probably he felt deeper
than he chose to express the misfortunes of that family for whom he
entertained so much friendship.  He turned aside his head to hide the traces
of emotion which, despite even his great powers of self-command, would shew
themselves upon his handsome and intelligent countenance.  Then it appeared 
as
if his noble indignation had got, for a few brief moments, the better of all
prudence, and he exclaimed, --

     "The villain! the worse than villain! who would, with a thousand
artifices, make himself beloved by a young, unsuspecting, and beautiful 
girl,
but then to leave her to the bitterness of regret, than she had ever given
such a man a place in her esteem.  The heartless ruffian!"

     "Be calm, Mr. Marchdale, I pray you be calm," said George; "I never saw
you so much moved."

     "Excuse me," he said, "excuse me; I am much moved, and I am human.  I
cannot always, let me strive my utmost, place a curb upon my feelings."

     "They are feelings which do you honour."

     "Nay, nay, I am foolish to have suffered myself to be led away into 
such
a hasty expression of them.  I am accustomed to feel acutely and to feel
deeply, but it is seldom I am so much overcome as this."

     "Will you accompany us to the breakfast-room at once, Mr. Marchdale,
where we will make this communication to Flora; you will then be able to 
judge
by her manner of receiving it, what it will be best to say to her."

     "Come, then, and pray be calm.  The least that is said upon this 
painful
and harassing subject, after this morning, will be the best."

     "You are right-- you are right."

     Mr. Marchdale hastily put on his coat.  He was dressed, with the
exception of that one article of apparel, when the brothers came to his
chamber, and then he came to the breakfast-parlour where the painful
communication was to be made to Flora of her lover's faithlessness.

     Flora was already seated in that apartment.  Indeed, she had been
accustomed to meet Charles Holland there before others of the family made
their appearance, but, alas! this morning the kind and tender lover was not
there.

     The expression that sat upon the countenances of her brothers, and of 
Mr.
Marchdale, was quite sufficient to convince her that something more serious
than usual had occurred, and she at the moment turned very pale.  Marchdale
observed this change of countenance in her, and he advanced towards her,
saying, --

     "Calm yourself, Flora, we have something to communicate to you, but it 
is
a something which should excite indignation, and no other feeling, in your
breast."

     "Brother, what is the meaning of this?" said Flora, turning aside from
Marchdale, and withdrawing the hand which he would have taken.

     "I would rather have Admiral Bell here before I say anything," said
Henry, "regarding a matter in which he cannot but feel much interested
personally."

     "Here he is," said the admiral, who at that moment had opened the door 
of
the breakfast room.  "Here he is, so now fire away and don't spare the 
enemy."

     "And Charles?" said Flora, "where is Charles?"

     "D--n Charles!" cried the admiral, who had not been much accustomed to
control his feelings.

     "Hush! hush!" said Henry; "my dear sir, hush! do not indulge now in any
invectives.  Flora, here are three letters; you will see that the one which 
is
unopened is addressed to yourself. However, we wish you to read the whole
three of them, and then to form your own free and unbiased opinion."

     Flora looked as pale as a marble statue, when she took the letters into
her hands.  She let the two that were open fall on the table before her, 
while
she eagerly broke the seal of that which was addressed to herself.

     Henry, with an instinctive delicacy, beckoned every one present to the
window, so that Flora had not the pain of feeling that any eyes were fixed
upon her but those of her mother, who had just come into the room, while she
was perusing those documents which told such a tale of heartless
dissimulation.

     "My dear child," said Mrs. Bannerworth, "you are ill."

     "Hush! mother-- hush!" said Flora; "let me know all."

     She read the whole of the letters through, and then, as the last one
dropped from her grasp, she exclaimed, --

     "Oh, God! oh, God! what is all that has occurred compared to this? 
Charles-- Charles-- Charles!"

     "Flora!" exclaimed Henry, suddenly turning from the window. "Flora, is
this worthy of you?"

     "Heaven now support me!"

     "Is this worthy of the name you bear, Flora?  I should have thought, 
and
I did hope, that woman's pride would have supported you."

     "Let me implore you," added Marchdale, "to summon indignation to your
aid, Miss Bannerworth."

     "Charles-- Charles-- Charles!" she again exclaimed, as she wrung her
hands despairingly.

     "Flora, if anything could add a sting to my already irritated 
feelings,"
said Henry, "this conduct of yours would."

     "Henry-- brother, what mean you?  Are you mad?"

     "Are you, Flora?"

     "God, I wish now that I was."

     "You have read those letters, and yet you call upon the name of him who
wrote them with frantic tenderness."

     "Yes, yes," she cried; "frantic tenderness is the word.  It is with
frantic  tenderness I call upon his name, and ever will. -- Charles!  
Charles!
-- dear Charles!"

     "This surpasses all belief," said Marchdale.

     "It is the frenzy of grief," added George; "but I did not expect it of
her.  Flora -- Flora, think again."

     "Think-- think-- the rush of thought distracts.  Whence came these
letters? -- where did you find these most disgraceful forgeries?"

     "Forgeries!" exclaimed Henry; and he staggered back, as if some one had
struck him a blow.

     "Yes, forgeries!" screamed Flora.  "What has become of Charles Holland? 
Has he been murdered by some secret enemy, and then these most vile
fabrications made up in his name?  Oh, Charles, Charles, are you lost to me
for ever?"

     "Good God!" said Henry; "I did not think of that."

     "Madness! -- madness!" cried Marchdale.

     "Hold!" shouted the admiral.  "Let me speak to her."

     He pushed every one aside, and advanced to Flora.  He seized both her
hands in his own, and in a tone of voice that was struggling with feeling, 
he
cried, --

     "Look at me, my dear; I'm an old man-- old enough to be your 
grandfather,
so you needn't mind looking at me steadily in the face.  Look at me, I want 
to
ask you a question."

     Flora raised her beautiful eyes, and looked the old weather-beaten
admiral full in the face.

     Oh! what a striking contrast did those two persons present to each 
other.
That young and beautiful girl, with her small, delicate, childlike hands
clasped, and completely hidden in the huge ones of the old sailor, the 
white,
smooth skin contrasted with his wrinkled, hardened features.

     "My dear," he cried, "you have read those-- those d----d letters, my
dear?"

     "I have, sir."

     "And what do you think of them?"

     "They were not written by Charles Holland, your nephew."

     A choking sensation seemed to come over the old man, and he tried to
speak, but in vain.  He shook the hands of the young girl violently, until 
he
saw that he was hurting her, and then, before she could be aware of what he
was about, he gave her a kiss on the cheek, as he cried, --

     "God bless you-- God bless you!  You are the sweetest, dearest little
creature that ever was, or that ever will be, and I'm a d----d old fool,
that's what I am.  These letters were not written by my nephew, Charles.  He
is incapable of writing them, and, d--n me, I shall take shame to myself as
long as I live for ever thinking so."

     "Dear sir," said Flora, who somehow or another did not seem at all
offended at the kiss which the old man had given her; "dear sir, how could 
you
believe, for one moment, that they came from him?  There has been some
desperate villainy on foot.  Where is he? -- oh, find him, if he be yet 
alive.
If they who have thus striven to steal from him that honour, which is the
jewel of his heart, have murdered him, seek them out, sir, in the sacred 
name
of justice, I implore you."

     "I will-- I will.  I don't renounce him; he is my nephew still-- 
Charles
Holland-- my own dear sister's son; and you are the best girl, God bless 
you,
that ever breathed.  He loved you-- he loves you still; and if he's above
ground, poor fellow, he shall yet tell you himself he never saw those 
infamous
letters."

     "You-- you will seek for him?" sobbed Flora, and the tears gushed from
her eyes.  "Upon you, sir, who, as I do, feel assured of his innocence, I
alone rely.  If all the world say he is guilty, we will not think so."

     "I'm d----d if we do."

     Henry had sat down by the table, and, with his hands clasped together,
seemed in an agony of thought.

     He was now roused by a thump on the back by the admiral, who cried, --

     "What do you think, now, old fellow?  D--n it, things look a little
different now."

     "As God is my judge," said Henry, holding up his hands, "I know not 
what
to think, but my heart and feeling all go with you and with Flora, in your
opinion of the innocence of Charles Holland."

     "I knew you would say that, because you could not possibly help it, my
dear boy.  Now we are all right again, and all we have got to do is to find
out which way the enemy has gone, and then give chase to him."

     "Mr. Marchdale, what do you think of this new suggestion," said George 
to
that gentleman.

     "Pray, excuse me," was his reply; "I would much rather not be called 
upon
to give an opinion."

     "Why, what do you mean by that?" said the admiral.

     "Precisely what I say, sir."

     "D--n me, we had a fellow once in the combined fleets, who never had an
opinion till after something had happened, and then he always said that was
just what he thought."

     "I was never in the combined, or any other fleet, sir," said Marchdale
coldly.

     "Who the devil said you were?" roared the admiral.

     Marchdale merely hawed.

     "However," added the admiral, "I don't care, and never did, for 
anybody's
opinion, when I know I am right.  I'd back this dear girl here for opinions,
and good feelings, and courage to express them, against all the world, I
would, any day.  If I was not the old hulk I am, I would take a cruise in 
any
latitude under the sun, if it was only for the chance of meeting with just
such another."

     "Oh, lose no time!" said Flora.  "If Charles is not to be found in the
house, lose no time in searching for him, I pray you; seek him, wherever 
there
is the remotest probability he may chance to be.  Do not let him think he is
deserted."

     "Not a bit of it," cried the admiral.  "You make your mind easy, then, 
my
dear.  If he's above ground, we shall find him out, you may depend upon it. 
Come along master Henry, you and I will consider what had best be done in 
this
uncommonly ugly matter."

     Henry and George followed the admiral from the breakfast-room, leaving
Marchdale there, who looked serious and full of melancholy thought.

     It was quite clear that he considered Flora had spoken from the 
generous
warmth of her affection as regarded Charles Holland, and not from the
conviction which reason would have enforced her to feel.

     When he was now alone with her and Mrs. Bannerworth, he spoke in a
feeling and affectionate tone regarding the painful and inexplicable events
which had transpired.

                               Chapter XXVIII.


MR. MARCHDALE'S EXCULPATION OF HIMSELF. -- THE SEARCH THROUGH THE GARDENS. -
-
THE SPOT OF THE DEADLY STRUGGLE. -- THE MYSTERIOUS PAPER.


     It was, perhaps, very natural that, with her feelings towards Charles
Holland, Flora should shrink from every one who seemed to be of a directly
contrary impression, and when Mr. Marchdale now spoke, she showed but little
inclination to hear what he had to say in explanation.

     The genuine and unaffected manner, however, in which he spoke, could 
not
but have its effect upon her, and she found herself compelled to listen, as
well as, to a great extent, approve of the sentiments that fell from his 
lips.

     "Flora," he said, "I beg that you will here, in the presence of your
mother, give me a patient hearing.  You fancy that, because I cannot join so
glibly as the admiral in believing that these letters are forgeries, I must 
be
your enemy."

     "Those letters," said Flora, "were not written by Charles Holland."

     "That is your opinion."

     "It is more than an opinion.  He could not write them."

     "Well, then, of course, if I felt inclined, which Heaven alone knows I 
do
not, I could not hope successfully to argue against such a conviction.  But 
I
do not wish to do so.  All I want to impress upon you is, that I am not to 
be
blamed for doubting his innocence; and, at the same time, I wish to assure 
you
that no one in this house would feel more exquisite satisfaction than I in
seeing it established."

     "I thank you for so much," said Flora; "but as, to my mind, his 
innocence
has never been doubted, it needs to me no establishing."

     "Very good.  You believe these letters forgeries."

     "I do."

     "And that the disappearance of Charles Holland is enforced, and not of
his own free will?"

     "I do."

     "Then you may rely upon my unremitting exertions night and day to find
him; and any suggestions you can make, which is likely to aid in the search
shall, I pledge myself, be fully carried out."

     "I thank you, Mr. Marchdale."

     "My dear," said the mother, "rely on Mr. Marchdale."

     "I will rely on any one who believes Charles Holland innocent of 
writing
those odious letters, mother -- I rely upon the admiral.  He will aid me 
heart
and hand."

     "And so will Mr. Marchdale."

     "I am glad to hear it."

     "And yet doubt it, Flora," said Marchdale, dejectedly.  "I am very 
sorry
that such should be the case; I will not, however, trouble you any further,
nor, give me leave to assure you, will I relax in my honest endeavours to
clear up this mystery."

     So saying, Mr. Marchdale bowed, and left the room, apparently more 
vexed
than he cared to express at the misconstruction which had been put upon his
conduct and motives. He at once sought Henry and the admiral, to whom he
expressed his most earnest desire to aid in attempting to unravel the
mysterious circumstances which had occurred.

     "This strongly-expressed opinion of Flora," he remarked, "is of course
amply sufficient to induce us to pause before we say one word more that 
shall
in any way sound like a condemnation of Mr. Holland.  Heaven forbid that it
should."

     "No," said the admiral; "don't."

     "I do not intend."

     "I would not advise anybody."

     "Sir, if you use that as a threat -- "

     "A threat?"

     "Yes; I must say, it sounded marvelously like one."

     "Oh, dear, no -- quite a mistake.  I consider that every man has a fair
right to the enjoyment of his opinion.  All I have to remark is, that I 
shall,
after what has occurred, feel myself called upon to fight anybody who says
those letters were written by my nephew."

     "Indeed, sir."

     "Ah, indeed."

     "You will permit me to say such is a strange mode of allowing every one
the free enjoyment of his opinion."

     "Not at all."

     "Whatever pains and penalties may be the result, Admiral Bell, of
differing with so infallible authority as yourself, I shall do so whenever 
my
judgment induces me."

     "You will?"

     "Indeed I will."

     "Very good.  You know all the consequences."

     "As to fighting you, I should refuse to do so."

     "Refuse?"

     "Yes; most certainly."

     "Upon what ground?"

     "Upon the ground that you were a madman."

     "Come," now interposed Henry, "let me hope that, for my sake as well as
for Flora's, this dispute will proceed no further."

     "I have not courted it," said Marchdale.  "I have much temper, but I am
not a stick or a stone."

     "D---e, if I don't think," said the admiral, "you are a bit of both."

     "Mr. Henry Bannerworth," said Marchdale, "I am your guest, and but for
the duty I feel in assisting in the search for Mr. Charles Holland, I should
at once leave your house."

     "You need not trouble yourself on my account," said the admiral; "if I
find no clue to him in the neighbourhood for two or three days, I shall be 
off
myself."

     "I am going," said Henry, rising, "to search the garden and adjoining
meadows; if you two gentlemen choose to come with me, I shall of course be
happy of your company; if, however, you prefer remaining here to wrangle, 
you
can do so."

     This had the effect, at all events, of putting a stop to the dispute 
for
the present, and both the admiral and Mr. Marchdale accompanied Henry on his
search.  The search was commenced immediately under the balcony of Charles
Holland's window, from which the admiral had seen him emerge.

     There was nothing particular found there, or in the garden. Admiral 
Bell
pointed out accurately the route he had seen Charles take across the grass
plot just before he himself left his chamber to seek Henry.

     Accordingly, this route was now taken, and it led to a low part of the
garden wall, which any one of ordinary vigour could easily have surmounted.

     "My impression is," said the admiral, "that he got over here."

     "The ivy appears to be disturbed," remarked Henry.

     "Suppose we mark the spot, and then go round to the other side?"
suggested George.

     This was agreed to; for, although the young might have chosen rather to
clamber over the wall than go round, it was doubtful if the old admiral 
could
accomplish such a feat.

     The distance round, however, was not great, and as they had cast over 
the
wall a handful of flowers from the garden to mark the precise spot, it was
easily discoverable.

     The moment they reached it, they were panic-stricken by the appearances
which it presented.  The grass was for some yards round about completely
trodden up, and converted into mud.  There were deep indentations of feet-
marks in all directions, and such abundance of evidence that some most
desperate struggle had recently taken place there, that the most sceptical
person in the world could not have entertained any doubt upon the subject.

     Henry was the first to break the silence with which they each regarded
the broken ground.

     "This is conclusive to my mind," he said, with a deep sigh. "Here has
poor Charles been attacked."

     "God keep him!" exclaimed Marchdale, "and pardon me my doubts-- I am 
now
convinced."

     The old admiral gazed about him like one distracted. Suddenly he cried 
--

     "They have murdered him.  Some fiends in the shape of men have murdered
him, and Heaven only knows for what."

     "It seems but too probably," said Henry.  "Let us endeavour to trace 
the
footsteps.  Oh! Flora, Flora, what terrible news this will be to you."

     "A horrible supposition comes across my mind," said George. "What if he
met the vampyre?"

     "It may have been so," said Marchdale, with a shudder.  "It is a point
which we could endeavour to ascertain, and I think we may do so."

     "How?"

     "By some inquiry as to whether Sir Francis Varney was from home at
midnight last night."

     "True; that might be done."

     "The question, suddenly put to one of his servants, would, most 
probably,
be answered as a thing of course."

     "It would."

     "Then it shall be decided upon.  And now, my friend, since you have 
some
of you thought me luke-warm in this business, I pledge myself that, should 
it
be ascertained that Varney was from home at midnight last evening, I will 
defy
him personally, and meet him hand to hand."

     "Nay, nay," said Henry, "leave that course to younger hands."

     "Why so?"

     "It more befits me to be his challenger."

     "No, Henry.  You are differently situated to what I am."

     "How so?"

     "Remember, that I am in the world a lone man; without ties or 
connexions.
If I lose my life, I compromise no one by my death; but you have a mother 
and
a bereaved sister to look to who will deserve your care."

     "Hilloa," cried the admiral, "what's this?"

     "What?" cried each, eagerly, and they pressed forward to where the
admiral was stooping to the ground to pick up something which was nearly
completely trodden into the grass.

     He with some difficulty raised it.  It was a small slip of paper, on
which was some writing, but it was so much covered with mud as not to be
legible.

     "If this be washed," said Henry, "I think we shall be able to read it
clearly."

     "We can soon try that experiment," said George.  "And as the footsteps,
by some mysterious means, show themselves nowhere else but in this one
particular spot, any further pursuit of inquiry about here appears useless."

     "Then we will return to the house," said Henry, "and wash the mud from
this paper."

     "There is one important point," remarked Marchdale, "which appears to 
me
we have all overlooked."

     "Indeed!"

     "Yes."

     "What may that be?"

     "It is this.  Is any one here sufficiently acquainted with the
handwriting of Mr. Charles Holland to come to an opinion upon the letters?"

     "I have some letters from him," said Henry, "which we received while on
the continent, and I dare say Flora has likewise."

     "Then they should be compared with the alleged forgeries."

     "I know his handwriting well," said the admiral.  "The letters bear so
strong a resemblance to it that they would deceive anybody."

     "Then you may depend," remarked Henry, "some most deep-laid and 
desperate
plot is going on."

     "I begin," added Marchdale, "to dread that such must be the case.  What
say you to claiming the assistance of the authorities, as well as offering a
large reward for any information regarding Mr. Charles Holland?"

     "No plan shall be left untried, you may depend."

     They had now reached the house, and Henry having procured some clean
water, carefully washed the paper which had been found among the trodden
grass.  When freed from the mixture of clay and mud which had obscured it,
they made out the following words, --

     " -- it be so well.  At the next full moon seek a convenient spot, and 
it
can be done.  The signature is, to my apprehension, perfect.  The money 
which
I hold, in my opinion, is much more in amount than you imagine, must be 
ours;
and as for-- "

     Here the paper was torn across, and no further words were visible upon
it.

     Mystery seemed now to be accumulating upon mystery; each one, as it
showed itself darkly, seeming to bear some remote relation to what preceded
it; and yet only confusing it the more.

     That this apparent scrap of a letter had dropped from some one's pocket
during the fearful struggle, of which there were such ample evidences, was
extremely probably; but what it related to, by whom it was written, or by 
whom
dropped, were unfathomable mysteries.

     In fact, no one could give an opinion upon these matters at all; and
after a further series of conjectures, it could only be decided, that
unimportant as the scrap of paper appeared now to be, it should be preserved
in case it should, as there was a dim possibility that it might, become a
connecting link in some chain of evidence at another time.

     "And here we are," said Henry, "completely at fault, and knowing not 
what
to do."

     "Well, it is a hard case," said the admiral, "that, with all the will 
in
the world to be up and doing something, we are lying here like a fleet of
ships in a calm, as idle as possible."

     "You perceive we have no evidence to connect Sir Francis Varney with 
this
affair, either nearly or remotely," said Marchdale.

     "Certainly not," replied Henry.

     "But yet, I hope you will not lose sight of the suggestion I proposed, 
to
the effect of ascertaining if he were from home last night."

     "But how is that to be carried out?"

     "Boldly."

     "How boldly?"

     "By going at once, I should advise, to his house, and asking the first
one of his domestics you may happen to see."

     "I will go over," cried George; "on such occasions as these one cannot
act upon ceremony."

     He seized his hat, and without waiting for a word from any one 
approving
or condemning his going, off he went.

     "If," said Henry, "we find that Varney has nothing to do with the 
matter,
we are completely at fault."

     "Completely," echoed Marchdale.

     "In that case, admiral, I think we ought to defer to your feelings upon
the subject and do whatever you suggest should be done."

     "I shall offer a hundred pound reward to any one who can and will bring
any news of Charles."

     "A hundred pounds is too much," said Marchdale.

     "Not at all; and while I am about it, since the amount is made a 
subject
of discussion, I shall make it two hundred, and that may benefit some rascal
who is not so well paid for keeping the secret as I will pay him for
disclosing it."

     "Perhaps you are right," said Marchdale.

     "I know I am, as I always am."

     Marchdale could not forbear a smile at the opinionated old man, who
thought no one's opinion upon any subject at all equal to his own; but he 
made
no remark and only waited, as did Henry, with evident anxiety for the return
of George.

     The distance was not great, and George certainly performed his errand
quickly, for he was back in less time than they had thought he could return
in.  The moment he came into the room, he said, without waiting for any
inquiry to be made of him, --

     "We are at fault again.  I am assured that Sir Francis Varney never
stirred from home after eight o'clock last evening."

     "D--n it, then," said the admiral, "let us give the devil his due.  He
could not have had any hand in this business."

     "Certainly not."

     "From whom, George, did you get your information?" asked Henry, in a
desponding tone.

     "From, first of all, one of his servants, whom I met away from the 
house,
and then from one whom I saw at the house."

     "There can be no mistake, then?"

     "Certainly none.  The servants answered me at once, and so frankly that 
I
cannot doubt it."

     The door of the room was slowly opened, and Flora came in. She looked
almost the shadow of what she had been but a few weeks before.  She was
beautiful, but she almost realised the poet's description of one who had
suffered much, and was sinking into an early grave, the victim of a broken
heart: --

                    "She was more beautiful than death,
                       And yet as sad to look upon."

Her face was of a marble paleness, and as she clasped her hands, and glanced
from face to face, to see if she could gather hope and consolation from the
expression of any one, she might have been taken for some exquisite statue 
of
despair.

     "Have you found him?" she said.  "Have you found Charles?"

     "Flora, Flora," said Henry, as he approached her.

     "Nay, answer me; have you found him?  You went to seek him. Dead of
alive, have you found him?"

     "We have not, Flora."

     "Then I must seek him myself.  None will search for him as I will 
search;
I must myself seek him.  'Tis true affection that can alone be successful in
such a search."

     "Believe me, dear Flora, that all has been done which the shortness of
the time that has elapsed would permit.  Further measures will now 
immediately
be taken.  Rest assured, dear sister, that all will be done that the utmost
zeal can suggest."

     "They have killed him! they have killed him!" she said mournfully.  
"Oh,
God, they have killed him!  I am not now mad, but the time will come when I
must surely be maddened.  The vampyre has killed Charles Holland-- the
dreadful vampyre!"

     "Nay, now, Flora, this is frenzy."

     "Because he loved me has he been destroyed.  I know it, I know it. The
vampyre has doomed me to destruction.  I am lost, and all who loved me will 
be
involved in one common ruin on my account.  Leave me all of you to perish. 
If, for iniquities done in our family, some one must suffer to appease the
divine vengeance, let that one be me, and only me."

     "Hush, sister, hush!" cried Henry.  "I expected not this from you.  The
expressions you use are not your expressions.  I know you better.  There is
abundance of divine mercy, but no divine vengeance.  Be calm, I pray you."

     "Calm! calm!"

     "Yes.  Make an exertion of that intellect we all know you to possess.  
It
is too common a thing with human nature, when misfortune overtakes it, to
imagine that such a state of things is specially arranged.  We quarrel with
Providence because it does not interfere with some special miracle in our
favour; forgetting that, being denizens of this earth, and members of a 
great
social system, we must be subject occasionally to the accidents which will
disturb its efficient working."

     "Oh, brother, brother!" she exclaimed, as she dropped into a seat, "you
have never loved."

     "Indeed!"

     "No; you have never felt what it was to hold your being upon the breath
of another.  You can reason calmly, because you cannot know the extent of
feeling you are vainly endeavouring to combat."

     "Flora, you do me less than justice.  All I wish to impress upon your
mind is, that you are not in any way picked out by Providence to be 
specially
unhappy-- that there is no perversion of nature on your account."

     "Call you that hideous vampyre form that haunts me no perversion of
ordinary nature?"

     "What is is natural," said Marchdale.

     "Cold reasoning to one who suffers as I suffer.  I cannot argue with 
you;
I can only know that I am most unhappy-- most miserable."

     "But that will pass away, sister, and the sun of your happiness may 
smile
again."

     "Oh, if I could but hope!"

     "And wherefore should you deprive yourself of that poorest privilege of
the most unhappy?"

     "Because my heart tells me to despair."

     "Tell it you won't, then," cried Admiral Bell.  "If you had been at sea
as long as I have, Miss Bannerworth, you would never despair of anything at
all."

     "Providence guarded you," said Marchdale.

     "Yes, that's true enough, I dare say.  I was in a storm once off Cape
Ushant, and it was only through Providence, and cutting away the mainmast
myself, that we succeeded in getting into port."

     "You have one hope," said Marchdale to Flora, as he looked in her wan
face.

     "One hope?"

     "Yes.  Recollect you have one hope."

     "What is that?"

     "You think that, by removing from this place, you may find that peace
which is here denied you."

     "No, no, no."

     "Indeed.  I thought that such was your firm conviction."

     "It was; but circumstances have altered."

     "How?"

     "Charles Holland has disappeared here, and here must I remain to seek 
for
him."

     "True he may have disappeared here," remarked Marchdale; "and yet that
may be no argument for supposing him still here."

     "Where, then, is he?"

     "God knows how rejoiced I should be if I were able to answer your
question."

     "I must seek him, dead or alive!  I must see him before I bid adieu to
this world, which has now lost all its charms for me."

     "Do not despair," said Henry; "I will go to the town now at once, to 
make
known our suspicions that he has met with some foul play.  I will set every
means in operation that I possibly can to discover him.  Mr. Chillingworth
will aid me, too; and I hope that not many days will elapse, Flora, before
some intelligence of a most satisfactory nature shall be brought to you on
Charles Holland's account."

     "Go, go, brother; go at once."

     "I go now at once."

     "Shall I accompany you?" said Marchdale.

     "No.  Remain here to keep watch over Flora's safety while I am gone; I
can alone do all that can be done."

     "And don't forget to offer the two hundred pounds reward," said the
admiral, "to any one who can bring us news of Charles, on which we can 
rely."

     "I will not."

     "Surely-- surely something must result from that," said Flora, as she
looked in the admiral's face, as if to gather encouragement in her dawning
hopes from its expression.

     "Of course it will, my dear," he said.  "Don't you be downhearted; you
and I are of one mind in this affair, and of one mind we will keep.  We 
won't
give up our opinions for anybody."

     "Our opinions," she said, "of the honour and honesty of Charles 
Holland. 
That is what we will adhere to."

     "Of course we will."

     "Ah, sir, it joys me, even in the midst of this, my affliction, to find
one at least who is determined to do him full justice.  We cannot find such
contradictions in nature as that mind, full of noble impulses, should stoop 
to
such a sudden act of selfishness as those letters would attribute to Charles
Holland.  It cannot-- cannot be."

     "You are right, my dear.  And now, Master Henry, you be off, will you, 
if
you please."

     "I am off now.  Farewell, Flora, for a brief space."

     "Farewell, brother; and Heaven speed you on your errand."

     "Amen to that," cried the admiral; "and now, my dear, if you have got
half an hour to spare, just tuck your arm under mine, and take a walk with 
me
in the garden, for I want to say something to you."

     "Most willingly," said Flora.

     "I would not advise you to stray far from the house, Miss Bannerworth,"
said Marchdale.

     "Nobody asked you for advice," said the admiral.  "D---e, do you want 
to
make out that I ain't capable of taking care of her?"

     "No, no; but-- "

     "Oh, nonsense!  Come along, my dear; and if all the vampyres and odd 
fish
that were ever created were to come across our path, we would settle them
somehow or another.  Come along, and don't listen to anybody's croaking."

 Next Time: A Peep Through an Iron Grating. -- The Lonely Prisoner in His
 Dungeon.  -- The Mystery.




                                Chapter XXIX.


A PEEP THOROUGH AN IRON GRATING. -- THE LONELY PRISONER IN HIS DUNGEON. -- 
THE
MYSTERY.


     Without forestalling the interest of our story, or recording a fact in
its wrong place, we now call our readers' attention to a circumstance which
may, at all events, afford some food for conjecture.

     Some distance from the Hall, which, from time immemorial, had been the
home and the property of the Bannerworth family, was an ancient ruin known 
by
the name of Monks' Hall.

     It was conjectured that this ruin was the remains of some one of those
half monastic, half military buildings which, during the middle ages, were 
so
common in almost every commanding situation in every county of England.

     At a period of history when the church arrogated to itself an amount of
political power which the intelligence of the spirit of the age now denies 
to
it, and when its members were quite ready to assert at any time the truth of
their doctrines by the strong arm of power, such buildings as the one, the 
old
grey ruins of which were situated near Bannerworth Hall, were erected.

     Ostensibly for religious purposes, but really as a stronghold for
defence, as well as for aggression, this Monks' Hall, as it was called,
partook quite as much of the character of a fortress, as of an 
ecclesiastical
building.

     The ruins covered a considerable extent of ground, but the only part
which seemed successfully to have resisted the encroaches of time, at least 
to
a considerable extent, was a long hall in which the jolly monks no doubt
feasted and caroused.

     Adjoining to this hall, were the walls of other parts of the building,
and at several places there were small, low, mysterious-looking doors that
led, heaven knows where, into some intricacies and labyrinths beneath the
building, which no one had, within the memory of man, been content to run 
the
risk of losing himself in.

     It was related that among these subterranean passages and arches there
were pitfalls and pools of water; and whether such a statement was true or
not, it certainly acted as a considerable damper upon the vigour of 
curiosity.

     This ruin was so well known in the neighbourhood, and had become from
earliest childhood so familiar to the inhabitants of Bannerworth Hall, that
one would as soon expect an old inhabitant of Ludgate-hill to make some 
remark
about St. Paul's, as any of them to allude to the ruins of Monks' Hall.

     They never now thought of going near to it, for in infancy they had
sported among its ruins, and it had become one of those familiar objects
which, almost, from that very familiarity, cease to hold a place in the
memories of those who know it so well.

     It is, however, to this ruin we would now conduct our readers, 
premising
that what we have to say concerning it now, is not precisely in the form of 
a
connected portion of our narrative.

             *         *         *         *         *         *

     It is evening -- the evening of that first day of heart loneliness to
poor Flora Bannerworth.  The lingering rays of the setting sun are gilding 
the
old ruins with a wondrous beauty. The edges of the decayed stones seem now 
to
be tipped with gold, and as the rich golden refulgence of light gleams upon
the painted glass which still adorned a large window of the hall, a flood of
many-coloured beautiful light was cast within, making the old flag-stones,
with which the interior was paved, look more like some rich tapestry, laid
down to do honour to a monarch.

     So picturesque and so beautiful an aspect did the ancient ruin wear, 
that
to one with a soul to appreciate the romantic and the beautiful, it would 
have
amply repaid the fatigue of a long journey now to see it.

     And as the sun sank to rest, the gorgeous colours that it cast upon the
mouldering wall, deepened from an appearance of burnished gold to a crimson
hue, and from that again the colour changed to a shifting purple, mingling
with the shadows of the evening, and so gradually fading away into absolute
darkness.

     The place is as silent as the tomb -- a silence far more solemn than
could have existed, had there been no remains of a human habitation; because
even these time-worn walls were suggestive of what once had been; and the
wrapt stillness which now pervaded them brought with them a melancholy 
feeling
for the past.

     There was not even the low hum of insect life to break the stillness of
these ancient ruins.

     And now the last rays of the sun are gradually fading away. In a short
time all will be darkness.  A low gentle wind is getting up, and beginning
slightly to stir the tall blades of grass that have shot up between some of
the old stones.  The silence is broken, awfully broken, by a sudden cry of
despair; such a cry as might come from some imprisoned spirit, doomed to 
waste
an age of horror in a tomb.

     And yet it was scarcely to be called a scream, and not all a groan.  It
might have come from some one on the moment of some dreadful sacrifice, when
the judgment had not sufficient time to call courage to its aid, but
involuntarily had induced that sound which might not be repeated.

     A few startled birds flew from odd holes and corners about the ruins, 
to
seek some other place of rest.  The owl hooted from a corner of what had 
once
been a belfry, and a dreamy-looking bat flew out from a cranny and struck
itself headlong against a projection.

     Then all was still again.  Silence resumed its reign, and if there had
been a mortal ear to drink in that sudden sound, the mind might well have
doubted if fancy had not more to do with the matter than reality.

     From out a portion of the ruins that was enveloped in the deepest 
gloom,
there now glides a figure.  It is of gigantic height, and it moves along 
with
a slow and measured tread.  An ample mantle envelopes the form, which might
well have been taken for the spirit of one of the monks who, centuries 
since,
had made that place their home.

     It walked the whole length of the ample hall we have alluded to, and
then, at the window from which had streamed the long flood of many coloured
light, it paused.

     For more than ten minutes this mysterious looking figure there stood.

     At length there passed something on the outside of the window, that
looked like the shadow of a human form.

     Then the tall, mysterious, apparition-looking man turned, and sought a
side entrance to the hall.

     Then he paused, and, in about a minute, he was joined by another who 
must
have been he who had so recently passed the stained glass window on the 
outer
side.

     There was a friendly salutation between these two beings, and they 
walked
to the centre of the hall, where they remained for some time in animated
conversation.

     From the gestures they used, it was evident that the subject of their
discourse was one of deep and absorbing interest to both.  It was one, too,
upon which, after a time, they seemed a little to differ, and more than once
they each assumed attitudes of mutual defiance.

     This continued until the sun had so completely sunk, that twilight was
beginning sensibly to wane, and then gradually the two men appeared to have
come to a better understanding, and whatever might be the subject of their
discourse, there was some positive result evidently arrived at now.

     They spoke in lower tones.  They used less animated gestures than 
before;
and, after a time, they both walked slowly down the hall towards the dark 
spot
from whence the first tall figure had so mysteriously emerged.

                    *            *            *            *

     There is a dungeon -- damp and full of the most unwholesome exhalations
-- deep under ground it seems, and, in its excavations, it would appear as 
if
some small land springs had been liberated, for the earthen floor was one
continued extent of moisture.

     From the roof, too, came perpetually the dripping of water, which fell
with sullen, startling splashes in the pool below.

     At one end, and near to the roof, -- so near that to reach it, without
the most efficient means from the inside, was a matter of positive
impossibility -- is a small iron grating, and not much larger than might be
entirely obscured by any human face than might be close to it from the 
outside
of the dungeon.

     That dreadful abode is tenanted.  In one corner, on a heap of straw,
which appears freshly to have been cast into the place, lies a hopeless
prisoner.

     It is no great stretch of fancy to suppose, that it is from his lips 
came
the sound of terror and of woe that had disturbed the repose of that lonely
spot.

     The prisoner is lying on his back; a rude bandage round his head, on
which were numerous spots of blood, would seem to indicate that he had
suffered personal injury in some recent struggle.  His eyes were open.  They
were fixed desparingly, perhaps unconsciously, upon that small grating which
looked into the upper world.

     That grating slants upwards, and looks to the west, so that any one
confined in that dreary dungeon might be tantalized, on a sweet summer's 
day,
by seeing the sweet blue sky, and occasionally the white clouds flitting by 
in
that freedom which he cannot hope for.

     The carol of a bird, too, might reach him there.  Alas! sad remembrance
of life, and joy, and liberty.

     But now all is deepening gloom.  The prisoner sees nothing -- hears
nothing; and the sky is not quite dark.  That small grating looks like a
strange light-patch in the dungeon wall.

     Hark! some footstep sounds upon his ear.  The creaking of a door 
follows
-- a gleam of light shines into the dungeon, and the tall mysterious-looking
figure in the cloak stands before the occupant of that wretched place.

     Then comes in the other man, and he carries in his hand writing
materials.  He stoops to the stone couch on which the prisoner lies, and
offers him a pen, as he raises him partially from the miserable damp pallet.

     But there is no speculation in the eyes of that oppressed man.  In vain
the pen is repeatedly placed in his grip, and a document of some length,
written on parchment, is spread out before him to sign.  In vain is he held 
up
now by both of the men, who have thus mysteriously sought him in his 
dungeon;
he has not power to do as they would wish him.  The pen falls from his
nerveless grasp, and, with a deep sigh, when they cease to hold him up, he
falls heavily back upon the stone couch.

     Then the two men looked at each other for about a minute silently; 
after
which he who was the shorter of the two raised one hand, and, in a voice of
such concentrated hatred and passion as was horrible to hear, he said, --

     "D--n!"

     The reply of the other was a laugh; and then he took the light from the
floor, and motioned the one who seemed so little able to control his 
feelings
of bitterness and disappointment to leave the place with him.

     With a haste and vehemence, then, which showed how much angered he was,
the shorter man of the two now rolled up the parchment, and placed it in a
breast-pocket of his coat.

     He cast a withering look of intense hatred on the form of the
nearly-unconscious prisoner, and then prepared to follow the other.

     But when they reached the door of the dungeon, the taller man of the 
two
paused, and appeared for a moment or two to be in deep thought; after which 
he
handed the lamp he carried to his companion, and approached the pallet of 
the
prisoner.

     He took from his pocket a small bottle, and, raising the head of the
feeble and wounded man, he poured some portion of the contents into his 
mouth,
and watched him swallow it.

     The other looked on in silence, and then they both slowly left the 
dreary
dungeon.

                    *            *            *            *

     The wind rose, and the night had deepened into the utmost darkness.  
The
blackness of a night, unilluminated by the moon, which would not now rise 
for
some hours, was upon the ancient ruins.  All was calm and still, and no one
would have supposed that aught human was within those ancient, dreary 
looking
walls.

     Time will show who it was who lay in that unwholesome dungeon, as well 
as
who were they who visited him so mysteriously, and retired again with 
feelings
of such evident disappointment with the document it seemed of such 
importance,
at least to one of them, to get that unconscious man to sign.

 Next Time: The Visit of Flora to the Vampyre. -- The Offer. -- The Solemn
 Asseveration.




                                Chapter XXX.

THE VISIT OF FLORA TO THE VAMPYRE. -- THE OFFER. -- THE SOLEMN ASSEVERATION.


     Admiral Bell had, of course, nothing particular to communicate to Flora
in the walk he induced her to take with him in the gardens of Bannerworth
Hall, but he could talk to her upon a subject which was sure to be a welcome
one, namely, Charles Holland.

     And not only could he talk to her of Charles, but he was willing to 
talk
of him in the style of enthusiastic commendation which assimilated best with
her own feelings.  No one but the honest old admiral, who was as violent in
his likes and his dislikes as any one could possibly be, could just then 
have
conversed with Flora Bannerworth to her satisfaction of Charles Holland.

     He expressed no doubts whatever concerning Charles's faith, and to his
mind, now that he had got that opinion firmly fixed in his mind, everybody
that held a contrary one he at once denounced as a fool or a rogue.

     "Never you mind, Miss Flora," he said; "you will find, I dare say, that
all will come right eventually.  D--n me! the only thing that provokes me in
the whole business is, that I should have been such an old fool as for a
moment to doubt Charles."

     "You should have known him better, sir."

     "I should, my dear, but I was taken by surprise, you see, and that was
wrong, too, for a man who has held a responsible command."

     "But the circumstances, dear sir, were of a nature to take everyone by
surprise."

     "They were, they were.  But now, candidly speaking, and I know I can
speak candidly to you; do you really think this Varney is the vampyre?"

     "I do."

     "You do?  Well, then, somebody must tackle him, that's quite clear; we
can't put up with his fancies always."

     "What can be done?"

     "Ah, that I don't know, but something must be done, you know.  He wants
this place; Heaven only knows why or wherefore he has taken such a fancy to
it; but he has done so, that is quite clear.  If it had a good sea view, I
should not be so much surprised; but there's nothing of the sort, so it's no
way at all better than any other shore-going stupid sort of house, that you
can see nothing but land from."

     "Oh, if my brother would but make some compromise with him to restore
Charles to us and take the house, me might yet be happy."

     "D--n it! then you still think that he has a hand in spiriting away
Charles?"

     "Who else could do so?"

     "I'll be hanged if I know.  I do feel tolerably sure, and I have good
deal of reliance upon your opinion, my dear; I say, I do feel tolerably 
sure: 
but, if I was d----d sure, now, I'd soon have it out of him."

     "For my sake, Admiral Bell, I wish now to extract one promise from 
you."

     "Say your say, my dear, and I'll promise you."

     "You will not then expose yourself to the danger of any personal 
conflict
with that most dreadful man, whose powers of mischief we do not know, and
therefore cannot well meet or appreciate."

     "Whew! is that what you mean?"

     "Yes; you will, I am sure, promise me so much."

     "Why, my dear, you see the case is this.  In affairs of fighting, the
less ladies interfere the better."

     "Nay, why so?"

     "Because -- because, you see, a lady has no reputation for courage to
keep up.  Indeed, it's rather the other way, for we dislike a bold woman as
much as we hold in contempt a cowardly man."

     "But if you grant to us females that in consequence of our affections, 
we
are not courageous, you must likewise grant how much we are doomed to suffer
from the dangers of those whom we esteem."

     "You would be the last person in the world to esteem a coward."

     "Certainly.  But there is more true courage often in not fighting than 
in
entering into a contest."

     "You are right enough there, my dear."

     "Under ordinary circumstances, I should not oppose your carrying out 
the
dictates of your honour, but now, let me entreat you not to meet this 
dreadful
man, if man he can be called, when you know not how unfair the contest may
be."

     "Unfair?"

     "Yes.  May he not have some means of preventing you from injuring him,
and of overcoming you, which no mortal possesses?"

     "He may."

     "Then the supposition of such a case ought to be sufficient ground for 
at
once inducing you to abandon all idea of meeting with him."

     "My dear, I'll consider of this matter."

     "Do so."

     "There is another thing, however, which now you will permit me to ask 
of
you as a favour."

     "It is granted ere it is spoken."

     "Very good.  Now you must not be offended with what I am going to say,
because, however it may touch that very proper pride which you, and such as
you, are always sure to possess, you are fortunately at all times able to 
call
sufficient judgment to your aid to enable you to see what is really 
offensive
and what is not."

     "You alarm me by such a preface."

     "Do I? then here goes at once.  Your brother Henry, poor fellow, has
enough to do, has he not, to make all ends meet."

     A flush of excitement came over Flora's cheek as the old admiral thus
bluntly broached a subject of which she already knew the bitterness to such 
a
spirit as her brother's.

     "You are silent," continued the old man; "by that I guess I am not 
wrong
in my supposition; indeed it is hardly a supposition at all, for Master
Charles told me as much, and no doubt he had it from a correct quarter."

     "I cannot deny it, sir."

     "Then don't.  It ain't worth denying, my dear.  Poverty is no crime, 
but,
like being born a Frenchman, it's a d----d misfortune."

     Flora could scarcely refuse a smile, as the nationality of the old
admiral peeped out even in the midst of his most liberal and best feelings.

     "Well," he continued, "I don't intend that he shall have so much 
trouble
as he has had.  The enemies of his king and his country shall free him from
his embarrassments."

     "The enemies?"

     "Yes; who else?"

     "You speak in riddles, sir."

     "Do I?   Then I'll soon make the riddles plain.  When I went to sea I 
was
worth nothing -- as poor as a ship's cat after the crew had been paid off 
for
a month.  Well, I began fighting away as hard and fast as I could, and the
more I fought, and the more hard knocks I gave and took, the more money I
got."

     "Indeed!"

     "Yes; prize after prize we hauled into port, and at last the French
vessels wouldn't come out of their harbours."

     "What did you do then?"

     "What did we do then?  Why what was the most natural thing in the whole
world for us to do, we did."

     "I cannot guess."

     "Well, I am surprised at that.  Try again."

     "Oh, yes; I can guess now.  How could I have been so dull? You went and
took them out."

     "To be sure we did -- to be sure we did, my dear; that's how we managed
them.  And, do you see, at the end of the war I found myself with lots of
prize money, all wrung from old England's enemies, and I intend that some of
it shall find its way to your brother's pocket; and you see that will bear 
out
just what I said, that the enemies of his king and his country shall free 
him
from his difficulties -- don't you see?"

     "I see your noble generosity, admiral."

     "Noble fiddlesticks!  Now I have mentioned this matter to you, my dear,
and I don't so much mind talking to you about such matters as I should to 
your
brother, I want you to do me the favour of managing it all for me."

     "How, sir?"

     "Why, just this way.  You must find out how much money will free your
brother just now from a parcel of botherations that beset him, and then I 
will
give it to you, and you can hand it to him, you see, so I need not say
anything about it; and if he speaks to me on the subject at all, I can put 
him
down at once by saying, 'avast there, it's no business of mine.'"

     "And can you, dear admiral, imagine that I could conceal the generous
source from where so much assistance came?"

     "Of course; it will come from you.  I take a fancy to make you a 
present
of a sum of money; you do with it as you please -- it's yours, and I have no
right and no inclination to ask you what use you put it to."

     Tears gushed from the eyes of Flora as she tried to utter some word, 
but
could not.  The admiral swore rather fearfully, and pretended to wonder much
what on earth she could be crying for.  At length, after the first gush of
feeling was over, she said, --

     "I cannot accept of so much generosity, sir -- I dare not."

     "Dare not!"

     "No; I should think meanly of myself were I to take advantage of the
boundless munificence of your nature."

     "Take advantage!  I should like to see anybody take advantage of me,
that's all."

     "I ought not to take the money of you.  I will speak to my brother, and
well I know how much he will appreciate the noble, generous offer, my dear
sir."

     "Well, settle it your own way, only remember I have a right to do what 
I
like with my own money."

     "Undoubtedly."

     "Very good.  Then as that is undoubted, whatever I lend to him, mind I
give to you, so it's as broad as it's long, as the Dutchman said, when he
looked at the new ship that was built for him, and you may as well take it
yourself you see, and make no more fuss about it."

     "I will consider," said Flora, with much emotion -- "between this time
and the same hour to-morrow I will consider, sir, and if you can find any
words more expressive of heartfelt gratitude than others, pray imagine that 
I
have used them with reference to my own feelings towards  you for such an
unexampled offer of friendship."

     "Oh, bother-- stuff."

     The admiral now at once changed the subject, and began to talk of 
Charles
-- a most grateful theme to Flora, as may well be supposed.  He related to 
her
many little particulars connected with him which all tended to place his
character in a most amiable light, and as her ear drank in the words of
commendation of him she loved, what sweeter music could there be to her than
the voice of that old weather-beaten rough-spoken man.

     "The idea," he added, to a warm eulogium he had uttered concerning
Charles -- "the idea that he could write those letters my dear, is quite
absurd."

     "It is, indeed.  Oh, that we could know what had become of him!"

     "We shall know.  I don't think but what he's alive. Something seems to
assure me that we shall some of these days look upon his face again."

     "I am rejoiced to hear you say so."

     "We will stir heaven and earth to find him.  If he were killed, do you
see, there would have been some traces of him now at hand; besides, he would
have been left lying where the rascals attacked him."

     Flora shuddered.

     "But don't you fret yourself.  You may depend that the sweet little
cherub that sits up aloft has looked after him."

     "I will hope so."

     "And now, my dear, Master Henry will soon be home, I am thinking, and 
as
he has quite enough disagreeables on his own mind to be able to spare a few 
of
them, you will take the earliest opportunity, I am sure, of acquainting him
with the little matter we have been talking about, and let me know what he
says."

     "I will-- I will."

     "That's right.  Now, go in doors, for there's a cold air blowing here,
and you are a delicate plant rather just now-- go in and make yourself
comfortable and easy.  The worst storm must blow over at last."

                                     -+-

 Next Time: Sir Francis Varney and his Mysterious Vistor. -- The Strange
 Conference.




                                Chapter XXXI.

SIR FRANCIS VARNEY AND HIS MYSTERIOUS VISITOR. -- THE STRANGE CONFERENCE.


     Sir Francis Varney is in what he calls his own apartment. It is night,
and a dim and uncertain light from a candle which had been long neglected,
only serves to render obscurity more perplexing.  The room is a costly one. 
One replete with all the appliances of refinement and luxury which the 
spirit
and genius of the age could possibly supply him with, but there is upon his
brow the marks of corroding care, and little does that most mysterious being
seem to care for all the rich furnishings of that apartment in which he 
sits.

     His cadaverous-looking face is even paler and more death-like-looking
than usual; and, if it can be conceived possible that such a one can feel
largely interested in human affairs, to look at him, we could well suppose
that some interest of no common magnitude was at stake.

     Occasionally, too, he muttered some unconnected words, no doubt 
mentally
filling up the gaps which rendered the sentences incomplete, and being
unconscious, perhaps, that he was giving audible utterance to any of his 
dark
and secret meditations.

     At length he rose, and with an anxious  expression of countenance, he
went to the window, and looked out into the darkness of the night.  All was
still, and not an object was visible.  It was that pitchy darkness without,
which, for some hours, when the moon is late in lending her reflected beams,
comes over the earth's surface.

     "It is near the hour," he muttered  "it is now very near the hour; 
surely
he will come, and yet I know not why I should fear him, although I seem to
tremble at the thought of his approach. He will surely come.  Once a year--
only once does he visit me, and then 'tis but to take the price which he has
compelled me to pay for that existence, which but for him had been long 
since
terminated.  Sometimes I devoutly wish it were."

     With a shudder he returned to the seat he had so recently left, and 
there
for some time he appeared to meditate in silence.

     Suddenly now, a clock, which was in the hall of that mansion he had
purchased, sounded the hour loudly.

     "The time has come," said Sir Francis. "The time has come, he will 
surely
soon be here.  Hark! hark!"

     Slowly and distinctly he counted the strokes of the clock, and, when 
they
had ceased, he exclaimed, with sudden surprise --

     "Eleven!  But eleven! How have I been deceived.  I thought the hour of
midnight was at hand."

     He hastily consulted the watch he wore, and then he indeed found, that
whatever he had been looking forward to with dread for some time past, as
certain to ensue, at or about twelve o'clock, had yet another hour in which 
to
prey upon his imagination.

     "How could I have made so grievous an error?" he exclaimed. "Another 
hour
of suspense and wonder as to whether that man be among the living or the 
dead.
I have thought of raising my hand against his life, but some strange
mysterious feeling has always staid me; and I have let him come and go 
freely,
while an opportunity might well have served me to put such a design into
execution.  He is old, too-- very old, and yet he keeps death at a distance. 
He looked pale, but far from unwell or failing, when last I saw him.  Alas! 
a
whole hour yet to wait.  I would that this interview were over."

     That extremely well known and popular disease called the fidgets, now
began, indeed, to torment Sir Francis Varney.  He could not sit -- he could
not walk, and, somehow or another, he never once seemed to imagine that from
the wine cup he should experience any relief, although, upon a side table,
there stood refreshments of that character.  And thus some more time passed
away, and he strove to cheat it of its weariness by thinking of a variety of
subjects; but as the fates would have it, there seemed not one agreeable
reminiscence in the mind of that most inexplicable man, and the more he
plunged into the recesses of memory the more uneasy, not to say almost
terrified, he looked and became.  A shuddering nervousness came across him,
and, for a few moments, he sat as if he were upon the point of fainting.  By 
a
vigorous effort, however, be shook this off, and then placing before him the
watch, which now indicated about the quarter past eleven, he strove with a
calmer aspect to wait the coming of him whose presence, when he did come,
would really be a great terror, since the very thought beforehand produced 
so
much hesitation and dismay.

     In order too, if possible, then to further withdraw himself from a too
painful consideration of those terrors, which in due time the reader will be
acquainted with the cause of, he took up a book, and plunging into its
contents, he amused his mind for a time with the following brief narrative: 
--

     The wind howled round the gable ends of Bridport House in sudden and
furious gusts, while the inmates sat by the fire-side, gazing in silence 
upon
the blazing embers of the huge fire that shed a red and bright light all 
over
the immense apartment in which they all sat.

     It was an ancient looking place, very large, and capable of containing 
a
number of guests.  Several were present.

     An aged couple were seated in tall high straight-backed chairs.  They
were the owners of that lordly mansion, and near them sat two young maidens 
of
surpassing beauty; they were dissimilar and yet there was a slight likeness, 
but of totally different complexions.

     The one had tresses of raven black; eyebrows, eyelashes, and eyes were
all of the same hue; she was a beautiful and proud-looking girl, her
complexion clear, with the hue of health upon her cheeks, while a smile 
played
around her lips.  The glance of the eye was sufficient to thrill through the
whole soul.

     The other maiden was altogether different; her complexion altogether
fairer -- her hair of sunny chestnut, and her beautiful hazel eyes were 
shaded
by long brown eyelashes, while a playful smile also lit up her countenance. 
She was the younger of the two.

     The attention of the two young maidens had been directed to the words 
of
the aged owner of the house, for he had been speaking a few moments before. 
There were several other persons present, and at some little distance were
many of the domestics who were not denied the privilege of warmth and rest 
in
the presence of their master.

     These were not the times, when if servants sat down, they were deemed
idle;  but the daily task done, then the evening hour was spent by the fire-
side.

     "The wind howls and moans," said an aged domestic, "in an awful manner. 
I have never heard the like."

     "It seems as though some imprisoned spirit was waiting for the repose
that had been denied on earth," said the old lady, as she shifted her seat 
and
gazed steadily on the fire.

     "Ay," said her aged companion, "it is a windy night, and there will be 
a
storm before long, or I'm mistaken."

     "It was just such a night as that my son Henry left his home," said 
Mrs.
Bradley, "just such another-- only it had the addition of sleet and rain."

     The old man sighed at the mention of his son's name, a tear stood in 
the
eyes of the maidens, while one looked silently at the other, and seemed to
exchange glances.

     "I would that I might again see him before my body seeks its final home
in the cold remorseless grave."

     "Mother," said the fairest of the two maidens, "do not talk thus, let 
us
hope that we yet may have many years of happiness together."

     "Many, Emma?"

     "Yes, mamma, many."

     "Do you know that I am very old, Emma, very old indeed, considering 
what
I have suffered, such a life of sorrow and ill health is at least equal to
thirty years added to my life."

     "You may have deceived yourself, aunt," said the other maiden; "at all
events, you cannot count upon life as certain, for the strongest often go
first, while those who seem much more likely to fall, by care, as often live
in peace and happiness."

     "But I lead no life of peace and happiness, while Henry Bradley is not
here; besides, my life might be passed without me seeing him again."

     "It is now two years since he was here last," said the old man,

     "This night two years was the night on which he left."

     "This night two years?"

     "Yes."

     "It was this night two years," said one of the servant men, "because 
old
Dame Poutlet had twins on that night."

     "A memorable circumstance."

     "And one died a twelvemonth old," said the man; "and she had a dream
which foretold the event."

     "Ay, ay."

     "Yes, and moreover she's had the same dream again last Wednesday was a
week," said the man.

     "And lost the other twin?"

     "Yes sir, this morning."

     "Omens multiply," said the aged man; "I would that it would seem to
indicate the return of Henry to his home."

     "I wonder where he can have gone to, or what he could have done all 
this
time; probably he may not be in the land of the living."

     "Poor Henry," said Emma.

     "Alas, poor boy!  We may never see him again -- it was a mistaken act 
of
his, and yet he knew not otherwise how to act or escape his father's
displeasure."

     "Say no more -- say no more upon that subject; I dare not listen to it. 
God knows I know quite enough," said Mr. Bradley; "I knew not he would have
taken my words so to heart as he did."

     "Why," said the old woman, "he thought you meant what you said."

     There was a long pause, during which all gazed at the blazing fire,
seemingly wrapt in their own meditation.

     Henry Bradley, the son of the aged couple, had apparently left that day
two years, and wherefore had he left the home of his childhood? wherefore 
had
he, the heir to large estates, done this?

     He had dared to love without his father's leave, and had refused the
offer his father made him of marrying a young lady whom he had chosen for 
him,
but whom he could not love.  It was as much a matter of surprise to the 
father
that the son should refuse, as it was to the son that his father should
contemplate such a match.

     "Henry," said the father, "you have been thought of by me. I have made
proposals for marrying you to the daughter of our neighbour, Sir Arthur
Onslow."

     "Indeed, father!"

     "Yes; I wish you to go there with me to see the young lady."

     "In the character of a suitor?"

     "Yes," replied the father, "certainly; it's high time you were 
settled."

     "Indeed, I would rather not go, father; I have no intention of marrying
just yet.  I do not desire to do so."

     This was an opposition that Mr. Bradley had not expected from his son,
and which his imperious temper could ill brook, and with a darkened brow he
said, --

     "It is not much, Henry, that I trespass upon your obedience; but when I
do so, I expect that you will obey me."

     "But, father, this matter affects me for my whole life."

     "That is why I have deliberated so long and carefully over it."

     "But it is not unreasonable that I should have a voice in the affair,
father, since it may render me miserable."

     "You shall have a voice."

     "Then I say no to the whole regulation," said Henry, decisively.

     "If you do so you forfeit my protection, much more favour; but you had
better consider over what you have said.  Forget it, and come with me."

     "I cannot."

     "You will not?"

     "No, father; I cannot do as you wish me; my mind is fully made up upon
that matter."

     "And so is mine.  You either do as I would have you, or you leave the
house, and seek your own living and you are a beggar."

     "I should prefer being such," said Henry, "than to marry any young 
lady,
and be unable to love her."

     "That is not required."

     "No! I am astonished!  Not necessary to love the woman you marry!"

     "Not at all; if you act justly towards her she ought to be grateful; 
and
it is all that is requisite in the marriage state. Gratitude will beget 
love,
and love in one begets love in the other."

     "I will not argue with you, father, upon the matter.  You are a better
judge than I; you have had more experience."

     "I have. "

     "And it would be useless to speak upon the subject; but of this I can
speak -- my own resolve -- that I will not marry the lady in question."

     The son had all the stern resolve of the father, but he had also very
good reasons for what he did.  He loved, and was beloved in return; and 
hence
he would not break his faith with her whom he loved.

     To have explained this to his father would have been to gain nothing
except an accession of anger, and he would have made a new demand upon his
(the son's) obedience, by ordering him to discard from his bosom the image
that was there indelibly engraven.

     "You will not marry her whom I have I chosen for your bride?"

     "I cannot."

     "Do not talk to me of can and can't, when I speak of will and wont.  It
is useless to disguise the fact.  You have your free will in the matter.  I
shall take no answer but yes or no."

     "Then, no, father."

     "Good, sir; and now we are strangers."

     With that Mr. Bradley turned abruptly from his son, and left him to
himself.

     It was the first time they had any words or difference together, and it
was suddenly and soon terminated.

     Henry Bradley was indignant at what I had happened; he did not think 
his
father would have acted as he had done in this instance; but he was too much
interested in the fate of another to hesitate for a moment.  Then came the
consideration as to what he should do, now that he had arrived at such a
climax.

     His first thoughts turned to his mother and sister.  He could not leave
the house without bidding them good-bye.  He determined to see his mother, 
for
his father had left the Hall upon a visit.

     Mrs. Bradley and Emma were alone when he entered their apartment, and 
to
them he related all that had passed between himself and father.

     They besought him to stay, to remain there, or at least in that
neigbourhood; but he was resolved to quit the place altogether for a time, 
as
he could do nothing there, and he might chance to do something else-where.

     Upon this, they got together all the money and such jewels as they 
could
spare which in all amounted to a considerable sum; then taking an 
affectionate
leave of his mother and sister, Henry left the Hall -- not before he had 
taken
a long and affectionate farewell of one other who lived within those walls.

     This was no other than the raven-eyed maiden who sat by the fire-side,
and listened attentively to the conversation that was going on.  She was his
love -- she, a poor cousin.  For her sake he had braved all his father's
anger, and attempted to seek his fortune abroad.

     This done, he quietly left the Hall, without giving anyone any 
intimation
of where he was going.

     Old Mr. Bradley, when he had said so much to his son, was highly 
incensed
at what he deemed his obstinacy; and he thought the threat hanging over him
would have had a good effect; but he was amazed when he discovered that 
Henry
had instead left the Hall, and he knew not whither.

     For some time he comforted himself with the assurance that he would, he
must return; but, alas! he came not, and this was the second anniversary of
that melancholy day which no one more repented of and grieved for, than did
poor Mr. Bradley.

     "Surely, surely he will return, or let us know where he is," he said; 
"he
cannot be in need, else he would have written to us for aid."

     "No, no," said Mrs. Bradley; "it is, I fear, because he has not 
written,
that he is in want; he would never write if he was in poverty, lest he 
should
cause us unhappiness at his fate. Were he doing well, we should hear of it,
for he would be proud of the result of his own unaided exertions."

     "Well, well," said Mr. Bradley.  "I can say no more; if I was hasty, so
was he; it is passed.  I would forgive all the past if I could but see him
once again -- once again!"

     "How the wind howls," added the aged man; "and it's getting worse and
worse."

     "Yes, and the snow is coming down now in style," said one of the
servants, who brought in some fresh logs which were piled up on the fire, 
and
he shook the white flakes off his clothes.

     "It will be a heavy fall before morning," said one of the men.

     "Yes, it has been gathering for some days; it will be much warmer than 
it
has been when it is all down."

     "So it will -- so it will."

     At that moment there was a knocking at the gate, and the dogs burst 
into
a dreadful uproar from their kennels.

     "Go, Robert," said Mr. Bradley "and see who it is that knocks such a
night as this; it is not fit or safe that a dog should be out in lt"

     The man went out, and shortly returned, saying, --

     "So please you, sir, there is a traveller that has missed his way, and
desires to know if he can obtain shelter here, or if any one can be found to
guide him to the nearest inn."

     "Bid  him come in; we shall lose no warmth because there is one more
before the fire."

     The stranger entered, and said, --

     "I have missed my way, and the snow comes down so thick and fast, and
whirled in such eddies, that I fear, by myself, I should fall into some 
drift
and perish before morning."

     "Do not speak of it, sir," said Mr. Bradley; "such a night as this is a
sufficient apology for the request you make and an inducement to me to grant
it most willingly."

     "Thanks," replied the stranger; "the welcome is most seasonable."

     "Be seated, sir; take your seat by the ingle; it is warm."

     The stranger seated himself, and seemed lost in reflection, as he gazed
intently on the blazing logs.  He was a robust man, with great whiskers and
beard, and, to judge from his outward habiliments, he was a stout man.

     Have you travelled far?"

     "I have, sir."

     "You appear to belong to the army, if I mistake not?"

     "I do, sir."

     There was a pause; the stranger seemed not inclined to speak of himself
much; but Mr. Bradley continued, --

     "Have you come from foreign service, sir? I presume you have."

     "Yes; I have not been in this country more than six days."

     "Indeed; shall we have peace think you?"

     "I do so and I hope it may be so, for the sake of many who desire to
return to their native land, and to those they love best."

     Mr. Bradley heaved a deep sigh, which was echoed softly by all present,
and the stranger looked from one to another, with a hasty glance, and then
turned his gaze upon the fire.

     "May I ask, sir, if you have any person whom you regard in the army-- 
any
relative?"

     "Alas! I have -- perhaps, I ought to say I had a son.  I know not,
however, where he is gone."

     "Oh! a runaway; I see."

     "Oh, no; he left because there were some family differences, and now, I
would, that he were once more here."

     "Oh!" said the stranger, softly, "differences and mistakes will happen
now and then, when least desired."

     At this moment, an old hound who had lain beside Ellen Mowbray, she who
wore the coal-black tresses, lifted his head at the difference in sound that
was noticed in the stranger's voice. He got up and walked up to him, and 
began
to smell around him, and, in another moment, he rushed at him with a cry of
joy and began to lick and caress him in the most extravagant manner. This 
was
followed by a cry of joy in all present.

     "It is Henry!" exclaimed Ellen Mowbray, rising and rushing into his 
arms.
It was Henry, and he threw off the several coats he had on, as well as the
large beard he wore to disguise himself.

     "The meeting was a happy one.  There was not a more joyful house than
that within many miles around.  Henry was restored to the arms of those who
loved him, and, in a month, a wedding was celebrated between him and his
cousin Ellen.

     Sir Francis Varney glanced at his watch. It indicated but five minutes 
to
twelve o'clock, and he sprang to his feet.  Even as he did so, a loud 
knocking
at the principal entrance to his house awakened every echo within its walls.

 Next time: The Thousand Pounds. -- The Stranger's Precautions.




                               Chapter XXXII.

THE THOUSAND POUNDS. -- THE STRANGER'S PRECAUTIONS.


     Varney moved not now nor did he speak, but, like a statue, he stood 
with
his unearthly looking eyes rivetted upon the door of the apartment.  In a 
few
moments one of  his servants came, and said --

     "Sir, a person is here, who says he wants to see you.  He desired me to
say, that he had ridden far, and that moments were precious when the tide of
life was ebbing fast."

     "Yes! yes!" gasped Varney; "admit him I know him!  Bring him here?  It 
is
-- an -- old friend -- of mine."

     He sank into a chair, and still he kept his eyes fixed upon that door
through which his visitor must come.  Surely some secret of dreadful moment
must be connected with him whom Sir Francis expected -- dreaded --  and yet
dared not refuse to see. And now a footstep approaches -- a slow and a 
solemn
footstep -- it pauses a moment at the door of the apartment, and then the
servant flings it open, and a tall man enters.  He is enveloped in the folds
of a horseman's cloak, and there is the clank of spurs upon his heels as he
walks into the room.

     Varney rose again, but he said not a word; and for a few moments they
stood opposite each other in silence.  The domestic has left the room, and 
the
door is closed, so that there was nothing to prevent them from conversing;
and, yet, silent they continued for some minutes.  It seemed as if each was
most anxious that the other should commence the conversation first.

     And yet there was nothing so very remarkable in the appearance of that
stranger, which should entirely justify Sir Francis Varney, in feeling so 
much
alarm at his presence.  He certainly was a man past the prime of life; and 
he
looked like one who had battled much with misfortune, and as if time had not
passed so lightly over his brow, but that it had left deep traces of its
progress.

     The only thing positively bad about his countenance, was to be found in
his eyes.  There there was a most ungracious and sinister expression, a kind
of lurking and suspicions look, as if he were always resolving in his mind
some deep laid scheme, which might be sufficient to circumvent the whole of
mankind.

     Finding, probably, that Varney would not speak first, he let his cloak
fall more loosely about him, and in a low, deep tone, he said,

     "I presume I was expected?"

     "You were," said Varney.  "It is the day, and it is the hour."

     "You are right, I like to see you so mindful.  You don't improve in 
looks
since -- "

     "Hush -- hush! no more of that; can we not meet without a dreadful
allusion to the past?  There needs nothing to remind me of it; and your
presence here now shows that you are not forgetful.  Speak not of that 
fearful
episode.  Let no words combine to place it in a tangible shape to human
understanding. I cannot, dare not, hear you speak of that."

     "It is well," said the stranger; "as you please.  Let our interview be
brief.  You know my errand?"

     "I do.  So fearful a drag upon limited means, is not likely to be 
readily
forgotten."

     "Oh, you are too ingenious -- too full of well laid schemes, and to apt
and ready in their execution, to feel, as any fearful drag, the conditions 
of
our bargain.  Why do you look at me so earnestly?"

     "Because," said Varney -- and he trembled as he spoke -- "because each
lineament of your countenance brings me back to the recollection of the only
scene in life that made me shudder, and which I cannot think of, even with 
the
indifference of contempt. I see it all before my mind's eye, coming in
frightful panoramic array, those incidents, which even to dream of, are
sufficient to drive the soul to madness; the dread of this annual visit, 
hangs
upon me like a dark cloud upon my very heart; it sits like some foul 
incubus,
destroying its vitality and dragging me, from day to day, nearer to that 
tomb,
from whence not as before, I can emerge."

     "You have been among the dead?" said the stranger.

     "I have."

     "And yet are mortal?"

     "Yes," repeated Varney, "yes, and yet am mortal."

     "It was I that plucked you back to that world, which, to judge from 
your
appearance, has had since that eventful period but few charms for you.  By 
my
faith you look like-- "

     "Like what I am," interrupted Varney. "This is a subject that once a 
year
gets frightfully renewed between us.  For weeks before your visit I am 
haunted
by frightful recollections, and it takes me many weeks after you are gone,
before I can restore myself to serenity.  Look at me; am I not an altered
man?"

     "In faith you are," said the stranger.  "I have no wish to press upon 
you
painful recollections.  And yet 'tis strange to me that upon such a man as
you, the event to which you allude should produce so terrible an 
impression."

     "I have passed through the agony of death," said Varney, "and have 
again
endured the torture-- for it is such-- of the re-union of the body and the
soul; not having endured so much, not the faintest echo of such feelings can
enter into your imagination."

     "There may be truth in that, and yet, like a fluttering moth round a
flame, it seems to me, that when I do see you, you take a terrific kind of
satisfaction in talking of the past."

     "That is strictly true," said Varney; "the images with which my mind is
filled are frightful.  Pent up do they remain for twelve long months.  I can
speak to you, and you only, without disguise, and thus does it seem to me 
that
I get rid of the uneasy load of horrible imaginings.  When you are gone, and
have been gone a sufficient lapse of time, my slumbers are not haunted with
frightful images -- I regain a comparative peace, until the time slowly 
comes
round again, when we are doomed to meet."

     "I understand you.  You seem well lodged here?"

     "I have ever kept my word, and sent to you, telling you where I am."

     "You have, truly.  I have no shadow of complaint to make against you.  
No
one could have more faithfully performed his bond than you have.  I give you
ample credit for all that, and long may you live still to perform your
conditions."

     "I dare not deceive you, although to keep such faith I may be compelled
to deceive a hundred others."

     "Of that I cannot judge.  Fortune seems to smile upon you; you have not
as yet disappointed me."

     "And will not now," said Varney.  "The gigantic and frightful penalty 
of
disappointing you, stares me in the face.  I dare not do so."

     He took from his pocket, as he spoke, a clasped book, from which he
produced several bank notes, which he placed before the stranger.

     "A thousand pounds," he said; "that is the agreement."

     "It is to the very letter.  I do not return to you a thousand thanks--
we understand each other better than to waste time with idle compliment. 
Indeed I will go quite as far as to say, truthfully, that did not my
necessities require this amount from you, you should have the boon, for 
which
you pay that price at a much cheaper rate."

     "Enough! enough!" said Varney.  "It is strange, that your face should
have been the last I saw, when the world closed upon me, and the first that
met my eyes when I was again snatched back to life!  Do you pursue still 
your
dreadful trade?"

     "Yes" said the stranger, "for another year, and then, with such a
moderate competence as fortune has assigned me, I retire, to make way for
younger and abler spirits."

     "And then," said Varney, "shall you still require of me such an amount 
as
this?"

     "No; this is my last visit but one.  I shall be just and liberal 
towards
you.  You are not old; and I have no wish to become the clog of your
existence.  As I have before told you, it is my necessity, and not my
inclination, that sets the value upon the service I rendered you."

     "I understand you, and ought to thank you.  And in reply to so much
courtesy, be assured, that when I shudder at your presence, it is not that I
regard you with horror, as an individual, but it is because the sight of you
awakens mournfully the remembrance of the past."

     "It is clear to me," said the stranger; "and now I think we part with
each other in a better spirit than we ever did before; and when we meet 
again,
the remembrance that it is the last time, will clear away the gloom that I 
now
find hanging over you."

     "It may! it may!  With what an earnest gaze you still regard me!"

     "I do.  It does appear to me most strange, that time should not have
obliterated the effects which I thought would have ceased with their cause. 
You are no more the man that in my recollection you once were, than I am 
like
a sporting child."

     "And I never shall be," said Varney; "never-- never again! This self-
same
look which the hand of death had placed upon me, I shall ever wear.  I 
shudder
at myself, and as I oft perceive the eye of idle curiosity fixed steadfastly
upon me, I wonder in my inmost heart, if even the wildest guesser hits upon
the cause why I am not like unto other men?"

     "No.  Of that you may depend there is no suspicion; but I will leave 
you
now; we part such friends, as men situated as we are can be.  Once again 
shall
we meet, and then farewell for ever."

     "Do you leave England, then?"

     "I do.  You know my situation in life.  It is not one which offers me
inducements to remain.  In some other land, I shall win the respect and
attention I may not hope for here.  There my wealth will win many golden
opinions; and casting, as best I may, the veil of forgetfulness over my 
former
life, my declining years may yet be happy.  This money, that I have had of 
you
from time to time, has been more pleasantly earned than all beside, wrung, 
as
it has been, from your fears, still have I taken it with less reproach.  And
now, farewell!"

     Varney rang for a servant to show the stranger from the house.  And
without another word they parted.  Then, when he was alone, that mysterious
owner of that costly home drew a long breath of apparently exquisite relief.

     "That is over! -- that is over!" he said. "He shall have the other
thousand pounds, perchance, sooner than he thinks.  With all expedition I 
will
send it to him.  And then on that subject I shall be at peace.  I shall have
paid a large sum; but that which I purchased was to me priceless.  It was my
life! -- it was my life itself!  That possession which the world's wealth
cannot restore! and shall I grudge these thousands, which have found their 
way
into this man's hands?  No! 'Tis true, that existence, for me, has lost some
of its most resplendent charms.  'Tis true, that I have no earthly 
affections,
and that shunning companionship with all, I am alike shunned by all; and 
yet,
while the life-blood still will circulate within my shrunken veins, I cling 
to
vitality."

     He passed into an inner room, and taking from a hook, on which it hung, 
a
long, dark-coloured cloak, he enveloped his tall unearthly figure within its
folds.  Then, with his hat in his hand, he passed out of his house, and
appeared to be taking his way towards Bannerworth Hall.

     Surely it must be guilt of no common die that could oppress a man so
destitute of human sympathies as Sir Francis Varney. The dreadful suspicions
that hovered round him with respect to what he was, appeared to gather
confirmation from every act of his existence.

     Whether or not this man, to whom he felt bound to pay annually so large 
a
sum, was in the secret, and knew him to be something more than earthly, we
cannot at present declare; but it would seem from the tenor of their
conversation as if such were the fact.

     Perchance he had saved him from the corruption of the tomb, by placing
out, on some sylvan spot, where the cold moonbeams fell, the apparently
lifeless form, and now claimed so large a reward for such a service, and the
necessary secrecy contingent upon it.

     We say this may be so, and yet again some more natural and rational
explanation may unexpectedly present itself; and there may be yet a dark 
page
in Sir Francis Varney's life's volume, which will place him in a light of
superadded terrors to our readers.

     Time, and the now rapidly accumulating incidents of our tale, will soon
tear aside the veil of mystery that now envelopes some of our _dramatis
personae_.

     And let us hope that in the development of those incidents we shall be
enabled to rescue the beautiful Flora Bannerworth from the despairing gloom
that is around her.  Let us hope and even anticipate that we shall see her
smile again; that the roseate hue of health will again revisit her cheeks, 
the
light buoyancy of her step return, and that as before she may be the joy of
all around her, dispensing and receiving happiness.

     And, he too, that gallant fearless lover, he whom no chance of time or
tide could sever from the object of his fond affections, he who listened to
nothing but the dictates of his heart's best feelings, let us indulge a hope
that he will have a bright reward, and that the sunshine of a permanent
felicity will only seem the brighter for the shadows that for a time have
obscured its glory.

 Next Time: The Strange Interview. -- The Chase Through the Hall.




                               Chapter XXXIII.

THE STRANGE INTERVIEW. -- THE CHASE THROUGH THE HALL.


     It was with the most melancholy aspect that anything human could well
bear, that Sir Francis Varney took his lonely walk, although perhaps in 
saying
so much, probably we are instituting a comparison which circumstances 
scarcely
empower us to do; for who shall say that singular man, around whom a very
atmosphere of mystery seemed to be perpetually increasing, was human?

     Averse as we are to believe in the supernatural, or even to invest
humanity with any preternatural powers, the more singular facts and
circumstances surrounding the existence and the acts of that man bring to 
the
mind a kind of shuddering conviction, that if he be indeed really mortal he
still must possess some powers beyond ordinary mortality, and be walking the
earth for some unhallowed purposes, such as ordinary men with ordinary
attributes of human nature can scarcely guess at.

     Silently and alone he took his way through that beautiful tract of
country, comprehending such picturesque charms of hill and dale which lay
between his home and Bannerworth Hall.  He was evidently intent upon 
reaching
the latter place by the shortest possible route, and in the darkness of that
night, for the moon had not yet risen, he showed no slight acquaintance with
the intricacies of that locality, that he was at all enabled to pursue so
undeviatingly a track as that which he took.

     He muttered frequently to himself low, indistinct words as he went, and
chiefly did they seem to have reference to that strange interview he had so
recently had with one who, from some combination of circumstances scarcely 
to
be guessed at, evidently exercised a powerful control over him, and was
enabled to make a demand upon his pecuniary resources of rather startling
magnitude.

     And yet, from a stray word or two, which were pronounced more 
distinctly,
he did not seem to be thinking in anger over that interview; but it would
appear that it rather had recalled to his remembrance circumstances of a
painful and a degrading nature, which time had not been able entirely to
obliterate from his recollection.

     "Yes, yes," he said, as he paused upon the margin of the wood, to the
confines of which he, or what seemed to be he, had once been chased by
Marchdale and the Bannerworths -- "yes, the very sight of that man recalls 
all
the frightful pageantry of a horrible tragedy, which I can never-- never
forget.  Never can it escape my memory, as a horrible, a terrific fact; but 
it
is the sight of this man alone that can recall all its fearful minutia to my
mind, and paint to my imagination, in the most vivid colours, every, the 
least
particular connected with that time of agony.  These periodical visits much
affect me.  For months I dread them, and for months I am but slowly 
recovering
from the shocks they give me.  'But once more,' he says-- 'but once more,'
and then we shall not meet again.  Well, well; perchance before that time
arrives, I may be able to possess myself of those resources which will 
enable
me to forestall his visit, and so at least free myself from the pang of
expecting him."

     He paused at the margin of the wood, and glanced in the direction of
Bannerworth Hall.  By the dim light which yet showed from out the light sky,
he could discern the ancient gable ends, and turret-like windows; he could 
see
the well laid out gardens, and the grove of stately firs that shaded it from
the northern blasts, and, as he gazed, a strong emotion seemed to come over
him, such as no one could have supposed would for one moment have possessed
the frame of one so apparently unconnected with all human sympathies.

     "I know this spot well," he said, "and my appearance here on that
eventful occasion, when the dread of my approach induced a crime only second
to murder itself, was on such a night as this, when all was so still and 
calm
around, and when he who, at the merest shadow of my presence, rather chose 
to
rush on death than be assured it was myself.  Curses on the circumstances 
that
so foiled me!  I should have been most wealthy.  I should have possessed the
means of commanding the adulation of those who now hold me but cheaply:  but
still the time may come.  I have a hope yet, and that greatness which I have
ever panted for, that magician-like power over my kind, which the possession
of ample means alone can give, may yet be mine."

     Wrapping his cloak more closely around him, he strode forward with that
long, noiseless step which was peculiar to him. Mechanically he appeared to
avoid those obstacles of hedge and ditch which impeded his pathway.  Surely 
he
had come that road often, or he would not so easily have pursued his way.  
And
now he stood by the edge of a plantation which in some measure protected 
from
trespassers the more private gardens of the Hall, and there he paused, as if 
a
feeling of irresolution had come over him, or it might be, as indeed it 
seemed
from his subsequent conduct, that he had come without any fixed intention, 
or
if with a fixed intention, without any regular plan of carrying it into
effect.

     Did he again dream of intruding into any of the chambers of that 
mansion,
with the ghastly aspect of that terrible creation with which, in the minds 
of
its inhabitants, he seemed to be but too closely identified?  He was pale,
attenuated, and trembled. Could it be that so soon it had become necessary 
to
renew the life-blood in his veins in the awful manner which it is supposed 
the
vampyre brood are compelled to protract their miserable existence?

     It might be so, and that he was even now reflecting upon how once more 
he
could kindle the fire of madness in the brain of that beautiful girl, who he
had already made so irretrievably wretched.

     He leant against an aged tree, and his strange, lustrous-looking eyes
seemed to collect every wandering scintillation of light that was around, 
and
to shine with preternatural intensity.

     "I must, I will," he said, "be master of Bannerworth Hall. It must come
to that.  I have set an existence upon its possession, and I will have it; 
and
then, if with my own hands I displace it brick by brick and stone by stone, 
I
will discover that hidden secret which no one but myself now dreams of.  It
shall be done by force or fraud, by love or by despair, I care not which; 
the
end shall sanctify all means.  Ay, even if I wade through blood to my 
desire,
I say it shall be done."

     There was a holy and a still calmness about the night much at variance
with the storm of angry passion that appeared to be momentarily gathering
power in the breast of that fearful man. Not the least sound came from
Bannerworth Hall, and it was, only occasionally that from afar off on the
night air there came the bark of some watch-dog, or the low of distant 
cattle.
All else was mute save when the deep sepulchral tones of that man, if man he
was, gave an impulse to the soft air around him.  With a strolling movement 
as
if he were careless if he proceeded in that direction or not, he still went
onward toward the house, and now he stood by that little summer-house once 
so
sweet and so dear a retreat, in which the heart-stricken Flora had held her
interview with him whom she loved with a devotion unknown to meaner minds.

     This spot scarcely commanded any view of the house, for so enclosed was
it among evergreens and blooming flowers, that it seemed like a very
wilderness of nature, upon which, with liberal hand, she had showered down 
in
wild luxuriance her wildest floral beauties.

     In and around that spot the night air was loaded with sweets.  The
mingled perfume of many flowers made that place seem a very paradise.  But 
oh,
how sadly at variance with that beauty and contentedness of nature was he 
who
stood amidst such beauty! All incapable as he was of appreciating its
tenderness, or of gathering the faintest moral from its glory.

     "Why am I here?" he said. "Here, without fixed design or stability of
purpose, like some miser who has hidden his own hoards so deeply within the
bowels of the earth he cannot hope that he shall ever again be able to bring
them to the light of day.  I hover around this spot which I feel-- which I
know-- contains my treasure, though I cannot lay my hands upon it, or exult
in its glistening beauty."

     Even as he spoke he cowered down like some guilty thing, for he heard a
fair footstep upon the garden path.  So light, so fragile was the step, 
that,
in the light of day, the very hum of summer insects would have drowned the
noise:  but he heard it, that man of crime -- of unholy and awful impulses. 
He heard it, and he shrunk down among the shrubs and flowers till he was
hidden completely from observation amid a world of fragrant essences.

     Was it some one stealthily in that place even as he was, unwelcome or
unknown? or was it one who had observed him intrude upon the privacy of 
those
now unhappy precincts, and who was coming to deal upon him that death which,
vampyre though he might be, he was yet susceptible of from mortal hands?

     The footstep advanced, and lower down he shrunk until his coward-heart
beat against the very earth itself.  He knew that he was unarmed, a
circumstance rare with him, and only to be accounted for by the disturbance 
of
his mind consequent upon the visit of that strange man to his house, those
presence had awakened so many conflicting emotions.

     Nearer and nearer still came that light footstep, and his deep-seated
fears would not let him perceive that it was not the step of caution or of
treachery, but owed its lightness to the natural grace and freedom of 
movement
of its owner.

     The moon must have arisen, although obscured by clouds, through which 
it
cast but a dim radiance, for the night had certainly grown lighter; so that
although there were no strong shadows cast, a more diffused brightness was
about all things, and their outlines looked not so dancing, and confused the
one with the other.

     He strained his eyes in the direction whence the sounds proceeded, and
then his fears for his personal safety vanished, for he saw it was a female
form that was slowly advancing towards him.

     His first impulse was to rise, for with the transient glimpse he got of
it, he knew that it must be Flora Bannerworth; but a second thought, 
probably
one of intense curiosity to know what could possibly have brought her to 
such
a spot at such a time restrained him, and he was quiet.  But if the surprise
of Sir Francis Varney was great to see Flora Bannerworth at such a time in
such a place, we have no doubt, that with the knowledge which our readers 
have
of her, their astonishment would more than fully equal his; and when we come
to consider, that since that eventful period when the sanctity of her 
chamber
had been so violated by that fearful midnight visitant, it must appear
somewhat strange that she could gather courage sufficient to wander forth
alone at such an hour.

     Had she no dread of meeting that unearthly being?  Did the possibility
that she might fall into his ruthless grasp, not come across her mind with a
shuddering consciousness of its probability?  Had she no reflection that 
each
step she took, was taking her further and further from those who would aid 
her
in all extremities?  It would seem not, for she walked onward, unheeding and
apparently unthinking of the presence possible or probable, of that bane of
her existence.

     But let us look at her again.  How strange and spectral-like she moves
along; there seems no speculation in her countenance but with a strange and
gliding step, she walks like some dim shadow of the past in that ancient
garden.  She is very pale, and on her brow there is the stamp of suffering;
her dress is a morning robe, she holds it lightly round her, and thus she
moves forward towards that summer-house which probably to her was sanctified
by having witnessed those vows of pure affection which came from the lips of
Charles Holland, about whose fate there now hung so great a mystery.

     Has madness really seized upon the brain of that beautiful girl?  Has 
the
strong intellect really sunk beneath the oppression to which it has been
subjected?  Does she now walk forth with a disordered intellect, the queen 
of
some fantastic realm, viewing the material world with eyes that are not of
earth; shunning perhaps that which she should have sought, and, perchance, 
in
her frenzy, seeking that which in a happier frame of mind she would have
shunned.

     Such might have been the impression of any one who had looked upon her
for a moment, and who knew the disastrous scenes through which she had so
recently passed; but we can spare our readers the pangs of such a 
supposition.
We have bespoken their love for Flora Bannerworth, and we are certain that 
she
has it; therefore would we spare them, even for a few brief moments, from
imagining that cruel destiny had done its worst, and that the fine and
beautiful spirit we have so much commended had lost its power of rational
reflection.  No; thank Heaven, such is not the case.  Flora Bannerworth is 
not
mad, but under the strong influence of some eccentric dream, which has
pictured to her mind images which have no home but in the airy realms of
imagination. She has wandered forth from her chamber to that sacred spot 
where
she had met him she loved, and heard the noblest declaration of truth and
constancy that ever flowed from human lips.

     Yes, she is sleeping; but, with a precision such as the somnambulist so
strangely exerts, she trod the well-known paths slowly, but surely, towards
that summer's bower, where her dreams had not told her lay crouching that 
most
hideous spectre of her imagination, Sir Francis Varney.  He who stood 
between
her and her heart's best joy; he who had destroyed all hope of happiness, 
and
who had converted her dearest affections into only so many causes of greater
disquietude than the blessings they should have been to her.  Oh! could she
have imagined but for one moment that he was there, with what an eagerness 
of
terror would she have flown back again to the shelter of those walls, where 
at
least was to be found some protection from the fearful vampyre's embrace, 
and
where she would be within hail of friendly hearts, who would stand boldly
between her and every thought of harm.

     But she knew it not, and onwards she went until the very hem of her
garment touched the face of Sir Francis Varney.

     And he was terrified -- he dared not move -- he dared not speak!  The
idea that she had died, and that this was her spirit, come to wreak some
terrible vengeance upon him, for a time possessed him, and so paralysed with
fear was he, that he could neither move nor speak.

     It had been well if, during that trance of indecision in which his 
coward
heart placed him, Flora had left the place, and again sought her home; but
unhappily such an impulse came not over her; she sat upon that rustic seat,
where she had reposed when Charles had clasped her to his heart, and through
her very dream the remembrance of that pure affection came across her, and 
in
the tenderest and most melodious accents, she said, --

     "Charles! Charles! and do you love me still?  No-- no; you have not
forsaken me.  Save me, save me from the vampyre!"

     She shuddered, and Sir Francis Varney heard her weeping.

     "Fool that I am," he muttered, "to be so terrified.  She sleeps.  This 
is
one of the phases which a disordered imagination oft puts on.  She sleeps, 
and
perchance this may be an opportunity of further increasing the dread of my
visitation, which shall make Bannerworth Hall far too terrible a
dwelling-place for her; and well I know, if she goes, they will all go. It
will become a deserted house, and that is what I want.  A house, too, with
such an evil reputation that none but myself, who have created that
reputation, will venture within its walls: -- a house, which superstition 
will
point out as the abode of spirits -- a house, as it were, by general 
opinion,
ceded to the vampyre.  Yes, it shall be my own; fit dwelling-place for a 
while
for me.  I have sworn it shall be mine, and I will keep my oath, little such
as I have to do with vows."

     He rose, and moved slowly to the row entrance of the summer-house; a
movement he could make, without at all disturbing Flora, for the rustic 
seat,
on which she sat, was at its further extremity.  And there he stood, the 
upper
part of his gaunt and hideous form clearly defined upon the now much lighter
sky, so that if Flora Bannerworth had not been in that trance of sleep in
which she really was one glance upward would let her see the hideous 
companion
she had, in that once much-loved spot -- a spot hitherto sacred to the best
and noblest feelings, but now doomed for ever to be associated with that
terrific spectre of despair.

     But she was in no state to see so terrible a sight.  Her hands were 
over
her face, and she was weeping still.

     "Surely, he loves me," she whispered; "he has said he loved me, and he
does not speak in vain.  He loves me still, and I shall again look upon his
face, a Heaven to me!  Charles! Charles! you will come again?  Surely, they
sin against the divinity of love, who would tell me that you love me not!"

     "Ha!" muttered Varney, "this passion is her first, and takes a strong
hold on her young heart-- she loves him-- but what are human affections to
me?  I have no right to count myself in the great muster-roll of humanity.  
I
look not like an inhabitant of the earth, and yet am on it.  I love no one,
expect no love from any one, but I will make humanity a slave to me; and the
lip-service of them who hate me in their hearts, shall be as pleasant 
jingling
music to my ear, as if it were quite sincere! I will speak to this girl; she
is not mad-- perchance she may be."

     There was a diabolical look of concentrated hatred upon Varney's face, 
as
he now advanced two paces towards the beautiful Flora.

 Next Time: The Threat. -- Its Consequences. -- The Rescue, and Sir Francis
 Varney's Danger.




                               Chapter XXXIV.

THE THREAT. -- ITS CONSEQUENCES. -- THE RESCUE, AND SIR FRANCIS VARNEY'S
DANGER.


     Sir Francis Varney now paused again, and he seemed for a few moments to
gloat over the helpless condition of her whom he had so determined to make 
his
victim; there was no look of pity in his face, no one touch of human 
kindness
could be found in the whole expression of those diabolical features; and if 
he
delayed making the attempt to strike terror into the heart of that unhappy,
but beautiful being, it could not be from any relenting feeling, but simply,
that he wished for a few moments to indulge his imagination with the idea of
perfecting his villany more effectually.

     And they who would have flown to her rescue, -- they, who for her would
have chanced all accidents, ay, even life itself, were sleeping, and knew 
not
of the loved one's danger.  She was alone, and far enough from the house, to
be driven to that tottering verge where sanity ends, and the dream of 
madness,
with all its terrors, commences.

     But still she slept -- if that half-waking sleep could indeed be
considered as any thing akin to ordinary slumber -- still she slept, and
called mournfully upon her lover's name; and in tender, beseeching accents,
that should have melted even the stubbornest hearts did she express her 
soul's
conviction that he loved her still.

     The very repetition of the name of Charles Holland seemed to be galling
to Sir Francis Varney.  He made a gesture of impatience, as she again 
uttered
it, and then stepping forward, he stood within a pace of where she sat, and 
in
a fearfully distinct voice he said, --

     "Flora Bannerworth, awake! awake! and look upon me, although the sight
blast you, and drive you to despair.  Awake! awake!"

     It was not the sound of the voice which aroused her from that strange
slumber.  It is said that those who sleep in that eccentric manner, are
insensible to sounds, but that the lightest touch will arouse them in an
instant; and so it was in this case, for Sir Francis Varney, as he spoke, 
laid
upon the hand of Flora two of his cold, corpse-like looking fingers.  A 
shriek
burst from her lips, and although the confusion of her memory and 
conceptions
was immense, yet she was awake, and the somnambulistic trance had left her.

     "Help, help!" she cried.  "Gracious Heavens!  Where am I?"

     Varney spoke not, but he spread out his long, thin arms in such a 
manner
that he seemed almost to encircle her, while he touched her not, so that
escape became a matter of impossibility, and to attempt to do so, must have
been to have thrown herself into his hideous embrace.

     She could obtain but a single view of the face and figure of him who
opposed her progress, but, slight as that view was, it more than sufficed. 
The very extremity of fear came across her, and she sat like one paralysed;
the only evidence of existence she gave consisting in the words, --

     "The vampyre-- the vampyre!"

     "Yes," said Varney, "the vampyre.  You know me, Flora Bannerworth--
Varney, the vampyre; your midnight guest at that feast of blood.  I am the
vampyre.  Look upon me well; shrink not from my gaze.  You will do well not 
to
shun me, but to speak to me in such a shape that I may learn to love you."

     Flora shook as in a convulsion, and she looked as white as any marble
statue.

     "This is horrible!" she said.  "Why does not Heaven grant me the death 
I
pray for?"

     "Hold!" said Varney.  "Dress not in the false colours of the 
imagination
that which in itself is sufficiently terrific to need none of the 
allurements
of romance.  Flora Bannerworth, you are persecuted-- persecuted by me, the
vampyre.  It is my fate to persecute you; for there are laws to the 
invisible
as well as the visible creation that force even such a being as I am to play
my part in the great drama of existence.  I am a vampyre; the sustenance 
that
supports this frame must be drawn from the life-blood of others."

     "Oh, horror-- horror!"

     "But most I do affect the young and beautiful.  It is from the veins of
such as thou art, Flora Bannerworth, that I would seek the sustenance I'm
compelled to obtain for my own exhausted energies.  But never yet, in all my
long career-- a career extending over centuries of time-- never yet have I
felt the soft sensation of human pity till I looked on thee, exquisite piece
of excellence.  Even at the moment when the reviving fluid from the gushing
fountain of your veins was warming my heart, I pitied and I loved you.  Oh,
Flora! even I can now feel the pang of being what I am!"

     There was a something in the tone, a touch of sadness in the manner, 
and
a deep sincerity in those words, that in some measure disabused Flora of her
fears.  She sobbed hysterically, and a gush of tears came to her relief, as,
in almost inaudible accents, she said, --

     "May the great God forgive even you!"

     "I have need of such a prayer," exclaimed Varney -- "Heaven knows I 
have
need of such a prayer.  May it ascend on the wings of the night air to the
throne of Heaven.  May it be softly whispered by ministering angels to the 
ear
of Divinity.  God knows I have need of such a prayer!"

     "To hear you speak in such a strain," said Flora, "calms the excited
fancy, and strips even your horrible presence of some of its maddening
influence."

     "Hush," said the vampire, "you must hear more -- you must know more ere
you speak of the matters that have of late exercised an influence of terror
over you."

     "But how came I here?" said Flora, "tell me that.  By what more than
earthly power have you brought me to this spot?  If I am to listen to you, 
why
should it not be at some more likely time and place?"

     "I have powers," said Varney, assuming from Flora's words, that she 
would
believe such arrogance -- "I have powers which suffice to bend many purposes
to my will-- powers incidental to my position, and therefore is it I have
brought you here to listen to that which should make you happier than you
are."

     "I will attend," said Flora.  "I do not shudder now; there's an icy
coldness through my veins, but it is the night air-- speak, I will attend
you."

     "I will.  Flora Bannerworth, I am one who has witnessed time's 
mutations
on man and on his works, and I have pitied neither; I have seen the fall of
empires, and sighed not that high-reaching ambition was toppled in the dust. 
I have seen the grave close over the young and the beautiful-- those whom I
have doomed by my insatiable thirst for human blood to death, long ere the
usual span of life was past, but I never loved till now."

     "Can such a being as you," said Flora, "be susceptible of such an 
earthly
passion? "

     "And wherefore not?"

     "Love is either too much of heaven, or too much of earth to find a home
with thee."

     "No, Flora, no! it may be that the feeling is born of pity. I will save
you-- I will save you from a continuance of the horrors that are assailing
you."

     "Oh! then may heaven have mercy in your hour of need."

     "Amen!"

     "And may you even yet know peace and joy above."

     "It is a faint and straggling hope-- but if achieved, it will be 
through
the interposition of such a spirit as thine, Flora, which has already
exercised so benign an influence upon my tortured soul, as to produce the 
wish
within my heart, to do at least one unselfish action."

     "That wish," said Flora, "shall be father to the deed. Heaven has
boundless mercy yet."

     "For thy sweet sake, I will believe so much, Flora Bannerworth; it is a
condition with my hateful race, that if we can find one human heart to love
us, we are free.  If, in the face of Heaven, you will consent to be mine, 
you
will snatch me from a continuance of my frightful doom; and for your pure
sake, and on your merits, shall I yet know heavenly happiness.  Will you be
mine?"

     A cloud swept from off the face of the moon, and a slant ray fell upon
the hideous features of the vampire.  He looked as if just rescued from some
charnel-house, and endowed for a space with vitality to destroy all beauty 
and
harmony in nature, and drive some benighted soul to madness.

     "No, no, no!" shrieked Flora, "never!"

     "Enough," said Varney, "I am answered.  It was a bad proposal.  I am a
vampyre still."

     "Spare me! spare me!"

     "Blood!"

     Flora sank upon her knees, and uplifted her hands to heaven. "Mercy,
mercy!" she said.

     "Blood!" said Varney, and she saw his hideous, fang-like teeth.  
"Blood!
Flora Bannerworth, the vampyre's motto.  I have asked you to love me, and 
you
will not-- the penalty be yours."

     "No, no!" said Flora.  "Can it be possible that even you, who have
already spoken with judgment and precision, can be so unjust? you must feel
that, in all respects, I have been a victim, most gratuitously-- a sufferer,
while there existed no just cause that I should suffer; one who has been
tortured, not from personal fault, selfishness, lapse of integrity, or
honourable feelings, but because you have found it necessary, for the
prolongation of your terrific existence, to attack me as you have done.  By
what plea of honour, honesty, or justice, can I be blamed for not embracing 
an
alternative which is beyond all human control? -- I cannot love you."

     "Then be content to suffer.  Flora Bannerworth, will you not, even for 
a
time, to save yourself and to save me, become mine?"

     "Horrible proposition!"

     "Then am I doomed yet, perhaps, for many a cycle of years, to spread
misery and desolation around me; and yet I love you with a feeling which has
in it more of gratefulness and unselfishness than ever yet found a home 
within
my breast.  I would fain serve you, although you cannot save me; there may 
yet
be a chance, which shall enable you to escape from the persecution of my
presence."

     "Oh! glorious chance!" said Flora.  "Which way can it come? tell me how 
I
may embrace it and such grateful feelings as a heart-stricken mourner can
offer to him, who has rescued her from her deep affliction, shall yet be
yours."

     "Hear me, then, Flora Bannerworth, while I state to you some 
particulars
of mysterious existence, of such beings as myself, which never yet have been
breathed to mortal ears."

     Flora looked intently at him, and listened, while, with a serious
earnestness Of manner, he detailed to her something of the physiology of the
singular class of beings which the concurrence of all circumstances tended 
to
make him appear.

     "Flora," he said, "it is not that I am so enamoured of an existence to 
be
prolonged only by such frightful means, which induces me to become a terror 
to
you or to others.  Believe me, that if my victims, those whom my insatiable
thirst for blood make wretched, suffer much, I, the vampyre, am not without 
my
moments of unutterable agony.  But it is a mysterious law of our nature, 
that
as the period approaches when the exhausted energies of life require a new
support from the warm, gushing fountain of another's veins, the strong 
desire
to live grows upon us, until, in a paroxysm of wild insanity, which will
recognise no obstacles, human or divine, we seek a victim."

     "A fearful state!" said Flora.

     "It is so; and, when the dreadful repast is over, then again the pulse
beats healthfully, and the wasted energies of a strange kind of vitality are
restored to us, we become calm again, but with that calmness comes all the
horror, all the agony of reflection, and we suffer far more than tongue can
tell."

     "You have my pity," said Flora; "even you have my pity."

     "I might well demand it, if such a feeling held a place within your
breast.  I might well demand your pity, Flora Bannerworth, for never crawled
an abject wretch upon the earth's rotundity, so pitiable as I."

     "Go on, go on."

     "I will, and with such brief conclusions as I may.  Having once 
attacked
any human being, we feel a strange, but terribly impulsive desire again to
seek that person for more blood.  But I love you, Flora; the small amount of
sensibility that still lingers about my preternatural existence, 
acknowledges
in you a pure and better spirit.  I would fain save you."

     "Oh! tell me how I may escape the terrible infliction."

     "That can only be done by flight.  Leave this place, I implore you! 
leave
it as quickly as the movement may be made. Linger not-- cast not one 
regretful
look behind you on your ancient home.  I shall remain in this locality for
years.  Let me lose sight of you, I will not pursue you; but, by force of
circumstances, I am myself compelled to linger here.  Flight is the only 
means
by which you may avoid a doom as terrific as that which I endure."

     "But tell me," said Flora, after a moment's pause, during which she
appeared to be endeavouring to gather courage to ask some fearful question;
"tell me if it be true that those who have once endured the terrific attack 
of
a vampyre, become themselves, after death, one of that dread race?"

     "It is by such means," said Varney, "that the frightful brood 
increases;
but, time and circumstances must aid the development of the new and horrible
existence.  You, however, are safe."

     "Safe! Oh! say that word again."

     "Yes, safe; not once or twice will the vampyre's attack have sufficient
influence on your mortal frame, as to induce a susceptibility on your part 
to
become coexistent with such as he. The attack must be often repeated, and 
the
termination of mortal existence must be a consequence essential, and direct
from those attacks, before such a result may be anticipated."

     "Yes, yes; I understand."

     "If you were to continue my victim from year to year, the energies of
life would slowly waste away, and, till like some faint taper's gleam,
consuming more sustenance than it received, the veriest accident would
extinguish your existence,  and then, Flora Bannerworth, you might become a
vampyre."

     "Oh! horrible! most horrible!"

     "If by chance, or by design, the least glimpse of the cold moonbeams
rested on your apparently lifeless remains, you would rise again and be one 
of
us -- a terror to yourself and a desolation to all around."

     "Oh! I will fly from here," said Flora.  "The hope of escape from so
terrific and dreadful a doom shall urge me onward; if flight can save me--
flight from Bannerworth Hall, I will pause not until continents and oceans
divide us."

     "It is well.  I'm able now thus calmly to reason with you. A few short
months more and I shall feel the languor of death creeping over me, and then
will come that mad excitement of the brain, which, were you hidden behind
triple doors of steel, would tempt me again to seek your chamber-- again to
seize you in my full embrace-- again to draw from your veins the means of
prolonged life-- again to convulse your very soul with terror."

     "I need no incentives," said Flora, with a shudder, "in the shape of
descriptions of the past, to urge me on."

     "You will fly from Bannerworth Hall?"

     "Yes, yes!" said Flora, "it shall be so; its very chambers now are
hideous with the recollection of scenes enacted in them. I will urge my
brothers, my mother, all to leave.  And in some distant clime we will find
security and shelter.  There even we will learn to think of you with more of
sorrow than of anger-- more pity than reproach-- more curiosity than
loathing."

     "Be it so," said the vampyre; and he clasped his hands, as if with a
thankfulness that he had done so much towards restoring peace at least to 
one,
who, in consequence of his acts, had felt such exquisite despair.  "Be it 
so;
and even I will hope that the feelings which have induced so desolated and 
so
isolated a being as myself to endeavour to bring peace to one human heart,
will plead for me, trumpet-tongued, to Heaven!"

     "It will-- it will," said Flora.

     "Do you think so?"

     "I do; and I will pray that the thought may turn to certainty in such a
cause."

     The vampyre appeared to be much affected; and then he added, --

     "Flora, you know this spot has been the scene of a catastrophe fearful 
to
look back upon, in the annals of your family?"

     "It has," said Flora.  "I know to what you allude; 'tis a matter of
common knowledge to all-- a sad theme to me, and one I would not court."

     "Nor would I oppress you with it.  Your father, here, on this very 
spot,
committed that desperate act which brought him uncalled for to the judgment
seat of God.  I have a strange, wild curiosity upon such subjects.  Will 
you,
in return for the good that I have tried to do you, gratify it?"

     "I know not what you mean," said Flora.

     "To be more explicit, then, do you remember the day on which your 
father
breathed his last?"

     "Too well-- too well."

     "Did you see him or converse with him shortly before that desperate act
was committed?"

     "No; he shut himself up for some time in a solitary chamber."

     "Ha! what chamber?"

     "The one in which I slept myself on the night-- "

     "Yes, yes; the one with the portrait-- that speaking portrait-- the 
eyes
of which seem to challenge an intruder as he enters the apartment."

     "The same."

     "For hours shut up there!" added Varney, musingly; "and from thence he
wandered to the garden, where, in this summer house, he breathed his last?"

     "It was so."

     "Then, Flora, ere I bid you adieu-- "

     These words were scarcely uttered, when there was a quick, hasty
footstep, and Henry Bannerworth appeared behind Varney, in the very entrance
of the summer-house.

     "Now," he cried, "for revenge!  Now, foul being, blot upon the earth's
surface, horrible imitation of humanity, if mortal arm can do aught against
you, you shall die!"

     A shriek came from the lips of Flora, and flinging herself past Varney,
who stepped aside, she clung to her brother, who made an unavailing pass 
with
his sword at the vampyre.  It was a critical moment; and had the presence of
mind of Varney deserted him in the least, unarmed as he was, he must have
fallen beneath the weapon of Henry.  To spring, however, up the seat which
Flora had vacated, and to dash out some of the flimsy and rotten wood-work 
at
the back of the summer-house by the propulsive power of his whole frame, was
the work of a moment; and before Henry could free himself from the clinging
embrace of Flora, Varney, the vampyre was gone, and there was no greater
chance of his capture than on the former occasion, when he was pursued in 
vain
from the Hall to the wood, in the intricacies of which he was so entirely
lost.

 Next Time: The Explanation. -- Marchdale's Advice. -- The Projected 
Removal,
 and the Admiral's Anger.




                                Chapter XXXV.

THE EXPLANATION. -- MARCHDALE'S ADVICE. -- THE PROJECTED REMOVAL, AND THE
ADMIRAL'S ANGER.


     This extremely sudden movement on the part of Varney was certainly as
unexpected as it was decisive.  Henry had imagined, that by taking 
possession
of the only entrance to the summer-house, he must come into personal 
conflict
with the being who had worked so much evil for him and his; and that he 
should
so suddenly have created for himself another mode of exit, certainly never
occurred to him.

     "For Heaven's sake, Flora," he said, "unhand me; this is a time for
action."

     "But, Henry, Henry, hear me."

     "Presently, presently, dear Flora; I will yet make another effort to
arrest the headlong flight of Varney."

     He shook her off, perhaps with not more roughness than was necessary to
induce her to forego her grasp of him, but in a manner that fully showed he
intended to be free; and then he sprang through the same aperture whence
Varney had disappeared, just as George and Mr. Marchdale arrived at the door
of the summer-house.

     It was nearly morning, so that the fields were brightening up with the
faint radiance of the coming day; and when Henry reached a point which he 
knew
commanded an extensive view, he paused, and ran his eye eagerly along the
landscape, with a hope of discovering some trace of the fugitive.  Such,
however, was not the case; he saw nothing, heard nothing of Sir Francis
Varney; and then he turned, and called loudly to George to join him, and was
immediately replied to by his brother's presence, accompanied by Marchdale.

     Before, however, they could exchange a word, a rattling discharge of
fire-arms took place from one of the windows and they heard the admiral, in 
a
loud voice, shouting, --

     "Broadside to broadside!  Give it them again, Jack!  Hit them between
wind and water!"

Then there was another rattling discharge, and Henry exclaimed, --

     "What is the meaning of that firing?"

     "It comes from the admiral's room," said Marchdale.  "On my life, I 
think
the old man must be mad.  He has some six or eight pistols ranged in a row
along the window-sill, and all loaded, so that by the aid of a match they 
can
be pretty well discharged as a volley, which he considers the only proper
means of firing upon the vampyre."

     "It is so," replied George; "and, no doubt, hearing an alarm, he has
commenced operations by firing into the enemy."

     "Well, well," said Henry; "he must have his way.  I have pursued Varney
thus far, and that he has again retreated to the wood, I cannot doubt. 
Between this and the full light of day, let us at least make an effort to
discover his place of retreat. We know the locality as well as he can
possibly, and I propose now that we commence an active search."

     "Come on, then," said Marchdale.  "We are all armed; and I, for one,
shall feel no hesitation in taking the life, if it be possible to do so, of
that strange being."

     "Of that possibility you doubt?" said George, as they hurried on across
the meadows.

     "Indeed I do, and with reason too.  I'm certain that when I fired at 
him
before I hit him; and besides, Flora must have shot him upon the occasion 
when
we were absent, and she used your pistols Henry, to defend herself and her
mother."

     "It would seem so," said Henry; "and disregarding all present
circumstances, if I do meet him, I will put to the proof whether he be 
mortal
or not."

     The distance was not great, and they soon reached the margin of the 
wood;
they then separated agreeing to meet within it, at a well-spring, familiar 
to
them all:  previous to which each was to make his best endeavour to discover
if any one was hidden among the bush-wood or in the hollows of the ancient
trees they should encounter on their line of march.

     The fact was, that Henry finding that he was likely to pass an
exceedingly disturbed, restless night, through agitation of spirits, had,
after tossing to and fro on his couch for many hours, wisely at length 
risen,
and determined to walk abroad in the gardens belonging to the mansion, in
preference to continuing in such a state of fever and anxiety, as he was in,
in his own chamber.

     Since the vampyre's dreadful visit, it had been the custom of both the
brothers, occasionally, to tap at the chamber door of Flora, who, at her own
request, now that she had changed her room, and dispensed with any one 
sitting
up with her, wished occasionally to be communicated with by some member of 
the
family.

     Henry, then, after rapidly dressing, as he passed the door of her
bedroom, was about to tap at it, when to his surprise he found it open, and
upon hastily entering it he observed that the bed was empty, and a hasty
glance round the apartment convinced him that Flora was not there.

     Alarm took possession of him, and hastily arming himself, he roused
Marchdale and George, but without waiting for them to be ready to accompany
him, he sought the garden, to search it thoroughly in case she should be
anywhere there concealed.

     Thus it was he had come upon the conference so strangely and so
unexpectedly held between Varney and Flora in the summer-house.  With what
occurred upon that discovery the readers are acquainted.

     Flora had promised George that she would return immediately to the 
house,
but when, in compliance with the call of Henry, George and Marchdale had 
left
her alone, she felt so agitated and faint that she began to cling to the
trellis work of the little building for a few moments before she could 
gather
strength to reach the mansion.

     Two or three minutes might thus have elapsed, and Flora was in such a
state of mental bewilderment with all that had occurred, that she could 
scarce
believe it real, when suddenly a slight sound attracted her attention, and
through the gap which had been made in the wall of the summer-house, with an
appearance of perfect composure, again appeared Sir Francis Varney.

     "Flora," he said, quietly returning the discourse which had been broken
off, "I am quite convinced now that you will be much the happier for the
interview."

     "Gracious Heaven!" said Flora, "whence have you come from?"

     "I have never left," said Varney.

     "But I saw you fly from this spot."

     "You did; but it was only to another immediately outside the summer
house.  I had no idea of breaking off our conference so abruptly."

     "Have you anything to add to what you have already stated?"

     "Absolutely nothing, unless you have a question to propose to me-- I
should have thought you had, Flora.  Is there no other circumstance weighing
heavily upon your mind, as well as the dreadful visitation I have subjected
you to?"

     "Yes," said Flora.  "What has become of Charles Holland?"

     "Listen.  Do not discard all hope; when you are far from here you will
meet with him again."

     "But he has left me."

     "And yet he will be able, when you again encounter him, so far to
extenuate his seeming perfidy, that you shall hold him as untouched in 
honour
as when first he whispered to you that he loved you."

     "Oh, joy! joy!" said Flora; "by that assurance you have robbed 
misfortune
of its sting, and richly compensated me for all that I have suffered."

     "Adieu!" said the vampyre.  "I shall now proceed to my own home by a
different route to that taken by those who would kill me."

     "But after this," said Flora, "there shall be no danger; you shall be
held harmless, and our departure from Bannerworth Hall shall be so quick, 
that
you will soon be released from all apprehension of vengeance from my 
brother,
and I shall taste again of that happiness which I thought had fled from me 
for
ever."

     "Farewell," said the vampire; and folding his cloak closely around him,
he strode from the summer-house, soon disappearing from her sight behind the
shrubs and ample vegetation with which that garden abounded.

     Flora sunk upon her knees, and uttered a brief, but heartfelt,
thanksgiving to Heaven for this happy change in her destiny.  The hue of
health faintly again visited her cheeks and as she now, with a feeling of 
more
energy and strength than she had been capable of exerting for many days,
walked towards the house, she felt all that delightful sensation which the
mind experiences when it is shaking off the trammels of some serious evil
which it delights now to find that the imagination has attired in far worse
colours than the facts deserved.

     It is scarcely necessary, after this, to say that the search in the 
wood
for Sir Francis Varney was an unproductive one, and that the morning dawned
upon the labours of the brothers and of Mr. Marchdale, without their having
discovered the least indication of the presence of Varney.  Again puzzled 
and
confounded, they stood on the margin of the wood, and looked sadly towards 
the
brightening windows of Bannerworth Hall, which were now reflecting with a
golden radiance the slant rays of the morning sun.

     "Foiled again," remarked Henry, with a gesture of impatience; "foiled
again, and as completely as before.  I declare that I will fight this man, 
let
our friend the admiral say what he will against such a measure I will meet 
him
in mortal combat; he shall consummate his triumph over our whole family by 
my
death, or I will rid the world and ourselves of so frightful a character."

     "Let us hope," said Marchdale, "that some other course may be adopted,
which shall put an end to these proceedings."

     "That," exclaimed Henry, "is to hope against all probability; what 
other
course can be pursued?  Be this Varney man or devil, he has evidently marked
us for his prey."

     "Indeed, it would seem so," remarked George; "but yet he shall find 
that
we will not fall so easily; he shall discover that if poor Flora's gentle
spirit has been crushed by these frightful circumstances, we are of a 
sterner
mould."

     "He shall," said Henry; "I for one will dedicate my life to this 
matter. 
I will know no more rest than is necessary to recruit my frame, until I have
succeeded in overcoming this monster; I will seek no pleasure here, and will
banish from my mind all else that may interfere with that one fixed pursuit. 
He or I must fall."

     "Well spoken," said Marchdale; "and yet I hope that circumstances may
occur to prevent such a necessity of action, and that probably you will yet
see that it will be wise and prudent to adopt a milder and a safer course."

     "No, Marchdale, you cannot feel as we feel.  You look on more as a
spectator, sympathising with the afflictions of either, than feeling the 
full
sting of those afflictions yourself."

     "Do I not feel acutely for you?  I'm a lonely man in the world, and I
have taught myself now to centre my affections in your family; my
recollections of early years assist me in so doing.  Believe me, both of 
you,
that I am no idle spectator of your griefs, but that I share them fully.  If 
I
advise you to be peaceful, and to endeavour by the gentlest means possible 
to
accomplish your aims, it is not that I would counsel you cowardice; but 
having
seen so much more of the world than either of you have had time or 
opportunity
of seeing, I do not look so enthusiastically upon matters, but, with a 
cooler,
calmer judgment, I do not say a better, I proffer to you my counsel."

     "We thank you," said Henry; "but this is a matter in which action seems
specially called for.  It is not to be borne that a whole family is to be
oppressed by such a fiend in human shape as that Varney."

     "Let me," said Marchdale, "counsel you to submit to Flora's decision in
this business; let her wishes constitute the rules of action.  She is the
greatest sufferer, and the one most deeply interested in the termination of
this fearful business. Moreover, she has judgment and decision of character;
she will advise you rightly, be assured."

     "That she would advise us honourably," said Henry, "and that we should
feel every disposition in the world to defer to her wishes our proposition, 
is
not to be doubted; but little shall be done without her counsel and 
sanction. 
Let us now proceed homeward, for I am most anxious to ascertain how it came
about that she and Sir Francis Varney were together in that summer-house at 
so
strange an hour."

     They all three walked together towards the house, conversing in a 
similar
strain as they went.

 Next Time: The Consultation. -- The Duel and its Results.



            Chapter XXXVI.


THE CONSULTATION. -- THE DUEL AND ITS RESULTS.


     Independent of this interview which Flora had had with the much dreaded
Sir Francis Varney, the circumstances in which she and all who were dear to
her, happened at that moment to be placed, certainly required an amount of
consideration, which could not be too soon bestowed.

     By a combination of disagreeables, everything that could possibly occur
to disturb the peace of the family seemed to have taken place at once; like
Macbeth's, their troubles had truly come in battalions, and now that the
serenity of their domestic position was destroyed, minor evils and 
annoyances
which that very serenity had enabled them to hold at arm's length became
gigantic, and added much to their distress.

     The small income, which, when all was happiness, health and peace, was
made to constitute a comfortable household, was now totally inadequate to do
so -- the power to economize and to make the most of a little, had flown 
along
with that contentedness of spirit which the harmony of circumstances alone
could produce.

     It was not to be supposed that poor Mrs. Bannerworth could now, as she
had formerly done, when her mind was free from anxiety, attend to those
domestic matters which make up the comforts of a family -- distracted at the
situation of her daughter, and bewildered by the rapid succession of
troublesome events which so short a period of time had given birth to, she
fell into an inert state of mind as different as anything could be, from her
former active existence.

     It has likewise been seen how the very domestics fled from Bannerworth
Hall in dismay, rather than remain beneath the same roof with a family
believed to be subject to the visitations of so awful a being as a vampyre.

     Among the class who occupy positions of servitude, certainly there 
might
have been found some, who, with feelings and understanding above such
considerations, would have clung sympathetically to that family in distress,
which they had known under a happier aspect; but it had not been the good
fortune of the Bannerworths to have such as these about them; hence
selfishness had its way, and they were deserted.  It was not likely, then,
that strangers would willingly accept service in a family so situated, 
without
some powerful impulse in the shape of a higher pecuniary consideration, as 
was
completely out of the power of the Bannerworths to offer.

     Thus was it, then, that most cruelly, at the very time that they had 
most
need of assistance and of sympathy, this unfortunate family almost became
isolated from their kind; and, apart from every other consideration, it 
would
have been almost impossible for them to continue inhabitants of the Hall, 
with
anything like comfort, or advantage.

     And then, although the disappearance of Charles Holland no longer
awakened those feelings of inclination at his supposed perfidy which were
first produced by that event; still, view it in which way they night, it was 
a
severe blow of fate, and after it, they one and all found themselves still
less able to contend against the sea of troubles that surrounded them.  The
reader, too, will not have failed to remark that there was about the whole 
of
the family that pride of independence which induced them to shrink from 
living
upon extraneous aid; and hence, although they felt and felt truly, that when
Admiral Bell, in his frank manner, offered them pecuniary assistance, that 
it
was no idle compliment, yet with a sensitiveness such as they might well be
expected to feel, they held back, and asked each other what prospect there 
was
of emerging from such a state of things, and if it were justifiable to
commence a life of dependence, the end of which was not evident or tangible.

     Not withstanding, too, the noble confidence of Flora in her lover, and
not withstanding that confidence had been echoed by her brothers, there 
would
at times obtrude into the minds of the latter, a feeling of the possibility,
that after all they might be mistaken; and Charles Holland might, from some
sudden impulse, fancying his future happiness was all at stake, have 
withdrawn
himself from the Hall, and really written the letters attributed to him.

     We say this only obtruded itself occasionally, for all their real
feelings and aspirations were the other way, although Mr. Marchdale, they
could perceive, had his doubts, and they could not but confess that he was
more likely to view the matter calmly and dispassionately than they.

     In fact, the very hesitation with which he spoke upon the subject,
convinced them of his doubts, for they attributed that hesitation to fear of
giving them pain, or of wounding the prejudices of Admiral Bell, with whom 
he
had already had words so nearly approaching to a quarrel.

     Henry's visit to Mr. Chillingworth was not likely to be productive of 
any
results beyond those of a conjectural character.  All that that gentleman
could do was to express a willingness to be directed by them in any way,
rather than suggest any course of conduct himself upon circumstances which 
he
could not be expected to judge of as they who were on the spot, and had
witnessed their actual occurrence.

      And now we will suppose that the reader is enabled with us to look 
into
one of the principal rooms of Bannerworth Hall.  It is evening, and some
candles are shedding a sickly light on the ample proportions of the once
handsome apartment.  At solemn consultation the whole of the family are
assembled.  As well as the admiral, Mr. Chillingworth, and Marchdale, Jack
Pringle, too, walked in, by the sufferance of his master, as if he 
considered
he had a perfect right to do so.

     The occasion of the meeting had been a communication which Flora had 
made
concerning her most singular and deeply interesting interview with the
vampyre.  The details of this interview had produced a deep effect upon the
whole of the family.

     Flora was there, and she looked better, calmer, and more collected than
she had done for some days past.

     No doubt the interview she had had with Varney in the summer-house in 
the
garden had dispelled a host of imaginary terrors with which she had 
surrounded
him, although it had confirmed her fully that he and he only was the 
dreadful
being who had caused her so much misery.  That interview had tended to show
her that about him there was yet something human, and that there was not a
danger of her being hunted down from place to place by so horrible an
existence.

     Such a feeling as this was, of course, a source of deep consolation; 
and
with a firmer voice, and more of her old spirit of cheerfulness about her 
than
she had lately exhibited, she again detailed the particulars of the 
interview
to all who had assembled concluding by saying, --

     "And this has given me hope of happier days.  If it be a delusion, it 
is
a happy one; and now that but a frightful veil of mystery still hangs over 
the
fate of Charles Holland, how gladly would I bid adieu to this place, and all
that has made it terrible.  I could almost pity Sir Francis Varney, rather
than condemn him."

     "That may be true," said Henry, "to a certain extent, sister; but we
never can forget the amount of misery he has brought upon us.  It is no 
slight
thing to be forced from our old and much-loved home, even if such proceeding
does succeed in freeing us from his persecutions."

     "But, my young friend," said Marchdale, "you must recollect, that 
through
life it is continually the lot of humanity to be endeavouring to fly from
great evils to those which do not present themselves to the mind in so bad 
an
aspect.  It is something, surely, to alleviate affliction, if we cannot
entirely remove it."

     "That is true," said Mr. Chillingworth, "to a considerable extent, but
then it takes too much for granted to please me."

     "How so, sir?"

     "Why, certainly, to remove from Bannerworth Hall is a much less evil 
than
to remain at Bannerworth Hail, and be haunted by a vampyre; but then that
proposition takes for granted that vampyre business, which I will never 
grant,
I repeat, again and again, it is contrary to all experience, to philosophy,
and to all the laws of ordinary nature."

     "Facts are stubborn things," said Marchdale.

     "Apparently," remarked Mr. Chillingworth.

     "Well, sir; and here we have the fact of the vampyre."

     "The presumed fact.  One swallow don't make a summer, Mr. Marchdale."

     "This is waste of time," said Henry -- "of course, the amount of 
evidence
that will suffice to bring conviction to one man's mind will fail in doing 
so
to another.  The question is, what are we to do?"

     All eyes were turned upon Flora, as if this question was more
particularly addressed to her, and it behoved her, above all others, to 
answer
it.  She did so; and in a firm, clear voice, she said, --

     "I will discover the fate of Charles Holland and then leave the Hall."

     "The fate of Charles Holland!" said Marchdale.  "Why, really, unless 
that
gentleman chooses to be communicative himself upon so interesting a subject,
we may be a long while discovering his fate.  I know that it is not a 
romantic
view to take of the question, to suppose simply that he wrote the three
letters found upon his dressing-table, and then decamped; but to my mind, it
savours most wonderfully of matter-of-fact.  I now speak more freely than I
have otherwise done, for I am now upon the eve of my departure.  I have no
wish to remain here, and breed dissension in any family, or to run a tilt
against anybody's prejudices."  Here he looked at Admiral Bell.  "I leave 
this
house to-night."

     "You're a d----d lubberly thief," said the admiral; "the sooner you 
leave
it the better.  Why, you bad-looking son of a gun, what do you mean? I 
thought
we'd had enough of that."

     "I fully expected this abuse," said Marchdale.

     "Did you expect that?" said the admiral, as he snatched up an inkstand,
and threw at Marchdale, hitting him a hard knock on the chin, and 
bespattering
its contents on his breast.  "Now I'll give you satisfaction, you lubber. 
D--me, if you ain't a second Jones, and enough to sink the ship.  Shiver my
timbers if I sha'n't say something strong presently."

     "I really," said Henry, "must protest, Admiral Bell, against this
conduct."

     "Protest and be d----d."

     "Mr. Marchdale may be right, sir, or he may be wrong, it's a matter of
opinion."

     "Oh, never mind," said Marchdale; "I look upon this old nautical 
ruffian
as something between a fool and a madman.  If he were a younger man I should
chastise him upon the spot; but as it is I live in hopes yet of getting him
into some comfortable lunatic asylum."

     "Me into an asylum!" shouted the admiral.  "Jack, did you hear that?"

     "Ay, ay, sir."

     "Farewell all of you," said Marchdale; "my best wishes be with this
family.  I cannot remain under this roof to be so insulted."

     "A good riddance," cried the admiral.  "I'd rather sail round the world
with a shipload of vampyres than with such a humbugging son of a gun as you
are.  D---e, you're worse than a lawyer."

     "Nay, nay," cried they, "Mr. Marchdale, stay."

     "Stay, stay," cried George, and Mrs. Bannerworth, likewise, said stay;
but at the moment Flora stepped forward, and in a clear voice she said, --

     "No, let him go, he doubts Charles Holland; let all go who doubt 
Charles
Holland.  Mr. Marchdale, Heaven forgive you this injustice you are doing.  
We
may never meet again.  Farewell, sir!"  These words were spoken in so 
decided
a tone, that no one contradicted them.  Marchdale cast a strange kind of 
look
round upon the family circle, and in another instant he was gone.

     "Huzza!" shouted Jack Pringle; "that's one good job."

     Henry looked rather resentful, which the admiral could not but observe,
and so, less with the devil-may-care manner in which he usually spoke, the 
old
man addressed him.

     "Hark ye, Mr. Henry Bannerworth, you ain't best pleased with me, and in
that case I don't know that I shall stay to trouble you any longer; as for
your friend who has just left you, sooner or later you'll find him out-- I
tell you there's no good in that fellow.  Do you think I've been cruizing
about for a matter of sixty years, and don't know an honest man when I see
him.  But never mind, I'm going on a voyage of discovery for my nephew, and
you can do as you like."

     "Heaven only knows, Admiral Bell," said Henry, "who is right and who is
wrong.  I do much regret that you have quarrelled with Mr. Marchdale; but 
what
is done can't be undone."

     "Do not leave us," said Flora; "let me beg of you, Admiral Bell, not to
leave us; for my sake remain here, for to you I can speak freely and with
confidence, of Charles, when probably I can do so to no one else.  You know
him well and have a confidence in him, which no one else can aspire to.  I
pray you, therefore, to stay with us."

     "Only on one condition," said the admiral.

     "Name it-- name it!"

     "You think of letting the Hall go."

     "Yes, yes."

     "Let me have it, then, and let me pay a few years in advance.  If you
don't, I'm d---d if I stay another night in the place.  You must give me
immediate possession, too, and stay here as my guests until you suit
yourselves elsewhere.  Those are my terms and conditions.  Say yes, and 
all's
right; say no, and I'm off like a round shot from a carronade.  D--me, 
that's
the thing Jack, isn't it?"

     "Ay, ay, sir."

     There was a silence of some few moments after this extraordinary offer
had been made, and then they spoke, saying, --

     "Admiral Bell, your generous offer, and the feelings which dictated it,
are by far too transparent for us to affect not to understand them.  Your
actions, Admiral-- "

     "Oh, bother my actions! what are they to you?  Come, now, I consider
myself master of the house, d--n you!  I invite you all to dinner, or 
supper,
or to whatever meal comes next.  Mrs. Bannerworth, will you oblige me, as 
I'm
an old fool in family affairs, by buying what's wanted for me and my guests? 
There's the money, ma'am.  Come along, Jack, we'll take a look over our new
house.  What do you think of it?"

     "Wants some sheathing, sir, here and there."

     "Very like; but, however, it will do well enough for us; we're in port,
you know.  Come along."

     "Ay, ay, sir."

     And off went the admiral and Jack, after leaving a twenty pound note in
Mrs. Bannerworth's lap.

 Next Time: Sir Francis Varney's Separate Opponents. -- The Interposition of
 Flora.




                               Chapter XXXVII.

SIR FRANCIS VARNEY'S SEPARATE OPPONENTS. -- THE INTERPOSITION OF FLORA.


     The old admiral so completely overcame the family of the Bannerworths 
by
his generosity and evident singlemindedness of his behaviour, that, although
not one, except Flora, approved of his conduct towards Mr. Marchdale, yet 
they
could not help liking him; and had they been placed in a position to choose
which of the two they would have had remain with them, the admiral or
Marchdale, there can be no question they would have made choice of the 
former.

     Still, however, it was not pleasant to find a man like Marchdale
virtually driven from the house, because he presumed to differ in opinion 
upon
a very doubtful matter with another of its inmates.  But as it was the 
nature
of the Bannerworth family always to incline to the most generous view of
subjects, the frank, hearty confidence of the old admiral in Charles Holland
pleased them better than the calm and serious doubting of Marchdale.

     His ruse of hiring the house of them, and paying the rent in advance, 
for
the purpose of placing ample funds in their hands for any contingency, was 
not
the less amiable because it was so easily seen through; and they could not
make up their minds to hurt the feelings of the old man by the rejection of
his generous offer.

     When he had left, this subject was canvassed among them, and it was
agreed that he should have his own way in the matter for the present, 
although
they hoped to hear something from Marchdale, which would make his departure
appear less abrupt and uncomfortable to the whole of the family.

     During the course of this conversation, it was made known to Flora with
more distinctness than under any other circumstances it would have been, 
that
Charles Holland had been on the eve of a duel with Sir Francis Varney,
previous to his mysterious disappearance.

     When she became fully aware of this fact, to her mind it seemed
materially to add to the suspicions previously to then entertained, that 
foul
means had been used in order to put Charles out of the way.

     "Who knows," she said, "that this Varney may not shrink with the 
greatest
terror from a conflict with any human being, and feeling one was inevitable
with Charles Holland, unless interrupted by some vigorous act of his own, he
or some myrmidons of his may have taken Charles's life!"

     "I do not think, Flora," said Henry, "that he would have ventured upon 
so
desperate an act; I cannot well believe such a thing possible.  But fear 
not;
he will find, if he have really committed any such atrocity, that it will 
not
save him."

     These words of Henry, though it made no impression at the time upon
Flora, beyond what they carried upon their surface, they really, however, as
concerned Henry himself, implied a settled resolution, which he immediately
set about reducing to practice.

     When the conference broke up, night, as it still was, he, without 
saying
anything to any one, took his hat and cloak, and left the Hall, proceeding 
by
the nearest practicable route to the residence of Sir Francis Varney, where 
he
arrived without any interruption of any character.

     Varney was at first denied to him, but before he could leave the house, 
a
servant came down the great staircase to say it was a mistake; and that Sir
Francis was at home, and would be happy to see him.

     He was ushered into the same apartment where Sir Francis Varney had
before received his visitors; and there sat the now declared vampyre, 
looking
pale and ghastly by the dim light which burned in the apartment, and, 
indeed,
more like some spectre of the tomb than one of the great family of man.

     "Be seated, sir," said Varney; "although my eyes have seldom the 
pleasure
of beholding you within these walls, be assured you are a honoured guest."

     "Sir Francis Varney," said Henry, "I came not here to bandy compliments
with you; I have none to pay to you, nor do I wish to hear any of them from
your lips."

     "An excellent sentiment, young man," said Varney, "and well delivered. 
May I presume, then, without infringing too far upon your extreme courtesy, 
to
inquire, to what circumstances I am indebted for your visit?"

     "To one, Sir Francis, that I believe you are better acquainted with 
than
you have the candour to admit."

     "Indeed, sir," said Varney, coldly "you measure my candour, probably, 
by
a standard of your own; in which case, I fear I may be no gainer; and yet 
that
may be of itself a circumstance that should afford little food for surprise,
but proceed, sir -- since we have so few compliments to stand between us and
our purpose, we shall in all due time arrive at it."

     "Yes, in due time, Sir Francis Varney, and that due time has arrived. 
Know you any thing of my friend, Charles Holland?" said Henry, in marked
accents; and he gazed on Sir Francis Varney with earnestness, that seemed to
say not even a look should escape his observation.

     Varney, however, returned the gaze as steadily, but coldly, as he 
replied
in his measured accents, --

     "I have heard of the young gentleman."

     "And seen him?"

     "And seen him too, as you, Mr. Bannerworth, must be well aware.  Surely
you have not come all this way, merely to make such an inquiry; but, sir, 
you
are welcome to the answer."

     Henry had something of a struggle to keep down the rising anger, at 
these
cool taunts of Varney; but he succeeded -- and then he said, --

     "I suspect Charles Holland, Sir Francis Varney, has met with unfair
treatment, and that he has been unfairly dealt with, for an unworthy 
purpose."

     "Undoubtedly," said Varney, "if the gentleman you allude to, has been
unfairly dealt with, it was for a foul purpose; for no good or generous
object, my young sir, could be so obtained -- you acknowledge so much, I 
doubt
not?"

     "I do, Sir Francis Varney; and hence the purpose of my visit here -- 
for
this reason I apply to you -- "

     "A singular object, supported by a singular reason.  I cannot see the
connection, young sir; pray proceed to enlighten me upon this matter, and 
when
you have done that, may I presume upon your consideration, to inquire in 
what
way I can be of any service to you?"

     "Sir Francis," said Henry, his anger raising his tones -- "this will 
not
serve you -- I have come to exact an account of how you have disposed of my
friend; and I will have it."

     "Gently, my good sir; you are aware I know nothing of your friend; his
motions are his own; and as to what I have done with him; my only answer is,
that he would permit me to do nothing with him, had I been so inclined to 
have
taken the liberty."

     "You are suspected, Sir Francis Varney, of having made an attempt upon
the life or liberty of Charles Holland; you, in fact, are suspected of being
his murderer -- and, so help me Heaven! if I have not justice, I will have
vengeance!"

     "Young sir, your words are of grave import and ought to be coolly
considered before they are uttered.  With regard to justice and vengeance, 
Mr.
Bannerworth, you may have both; but I tell you, of Charles Holland, or what
has become of him, I know nothing.  But wherefore do you come to so unlikely 
a
quarter to learn something of an individual of whom I know nothing?"

     "Because Charles Holland was to have fought a duel with you:  but 
before
that had time to take place, he has suddenly become missing.  I suspect that
you are the author of his disappearance, because you fear an encounter with 
a
mortal man."

     "Mr. Bannerworth, permit me to say, in my own defence, that I do not 
fear
any man, however foolish he may be; and wisdom is not an attribute I find,
from experience in all men, of your friend.  However, you must be dreaming,
sir -- a kind of vivid insanity has taken possession of your mind, which 
distorts --

     "Sir Francis Varney!" exclaimed Henry, now perfectly uncontrollable.

     "Sir," said Varney, as he filled up the pause, "proceed; I am all
attention.  You do me honour."

     "If," resumed Henry, "such was your object in putting Mr. Holland 
aside,
by becoming personally or by proxy an assassin, you are mistaken in 
supposing
you have accomplished your object."

     "Go on, sir," said Sir Francis Varney, in a bland and sweet tone; "I am
all attention; pray proceed."

     "You have failed; for I now here, on this spot, defy you to mortal
combat.  Coward, assassin as you are, I challenge you to fight."

     "You don't mean on the carpet here?" said Varney, deliberately.

     "No, sir; but beneath the canopy of heaven, in the light of the day.  
And
then, Sir Francis, we shall see who will shrink from the conflict."

     "It is remarkably good, Mr. Bannerworth, and, begging your pardon, for 
I
do  not wish to give any offence, my honoured sir, it would rehearse before 
an
audience; in short, sir, it is highly dramatic."

     "You shrink from the combat, do you?  Now, indeed, I know you."

     "Young man, young man," said Sir Francis, calmly, and shaking his head
very deliberately, and the shadows passed across his pale face, "you know me
not, if you think Sir Francis Varney shrinks from any man, much less one 
like
yourself."

     "You are a coward, and worse, if you refuse my challenge."

     "I do not refuse it; I accept it," said Varney, calmly, and in a
dignified manner; and then, with a sneer, he added, -- "You are well
acquainted with the mode in which gentlemen generally manage these matters,
Mr. Bannerworth, and perhaps I am somewhat confined in my knowledge in the
ways of the world, because you are your own principal and second.  In all my
experience, I never met with a similar case."

     "The circumstances under which it is given are as unexampled, and will
excuse the mode of the challenge," said Henry, with much warmth.

     "Singular coincidence -- the challenge and mode of it is most singular! 
They are well matched in that respect.  Singular, did I say?  The more I 
think
of it, Mr. Bannerworth, the more I am inclined to think this positively 
odd."

     "Early to-morrow, Sir Francis, you shall hear from me."

     "In that case, you will not arrange preliminaries now? Well, well; it 
is
very unusual for the principals themselves to do so; and yet, excuse my
freedom, I presumed, as you had so far deserted the beaten track, that I had
no idea how far you might be disposed to lead the same route."

     "I have said all I intended to say, Sir Francis Varney; we shall see 
each
other again."

     "I may not detain you, I presume, to taste aught in the way of
refreshment?"

     Henry made no reply, but turned towards the door, without even making 
an
attempt to return the grave and formal bow that Sir Francis Varney made as 
he
saw him about to quit the apartment; for Henry saw that his pale features 
were
lighted up with a sarcastic smile, most disagreeable to look upon as well as
irritating to Henry Bannerworth.

     He now quitted Sir Francis Varney's abode, being let out by a servant 
who
had been rung for for that purpose by his master.

     Henry walked homeward, satisfied that he had now done all that he could
under the circumstances.

     "I will send Chillingworth to him in the morning, and then I shall see
what all this will end in.  He must meet me, and then Charles Holland, if 
not
discovered, shall be, at least, revenged."

     There was another person in Bannerworth Hall who had formed a similar
resolution.  That person was a very different sort of person to Henry
Bannerworth, though quite as estimable in his way.

     This was no other than the old admiral.  It was singular that two such
very different persons should deem the same steps necessary, and both keep 
the
secret from each other; but so it was, and, after some internal swearing, he
determined upon challenging Varney in person.

     "I'd send Jack Pringle, but the swab would settle the matter as shortly
as if a youngster was making an entry in a log, and heard the boatswain's
whistle summoning the hands to a mess, and feared he would lose his grog.

     "D--n my quarters! but Sir Francis Varney, as he styles himself, 
sha'n't
make any way against old Admiral Bell.  He's as tough as a hawser, and just
the sort of blade for a vampyre to come athwart.  I'll pitch him end-long, 
and
make a plank of him afore long.  Cus my windpipe! what a long, lanky swab he
is, with teeth fit to unpick a splice; but let me alone, I'll see if I can't
make a hull of his carcass, vampyre or no vampyre.

     "My nevy, Charles Holland, can't be allowed to cut away without 
nobody's
leave or licence.  No, no; I'll not stand that anyhow.  'Never desert a
messmate in the time of need,' is the first maxim of a seaman, and I ain't 
the
one as'll do so."

     Thus self-communing, the old admiral marched along; until he came to 
Sir
Francis Varney's house, at the gate of which he gave the bell what he called 
a
long pull, a strong pull, and a pull altogether, that set it ringing with a
fury, the like of which had never certainly been heard by the household.

     A minute or two scarcely elapsed before the domestics hurried to answer
so urgent a summons; and when the gate was opened, the servant who answered 
it
inquired his business.

     "What's that to you, snob?  Is your master, Sir Francis Varney, in?
because, if he be, let him know old Admiral Bell wants to speak to him.  
D'ye
hear?"

     "Yes, sir," replied the servant, who had paused a few moments to 
examine
the individual who gave this odd kind of address.  In another minute word 
was
brought to him that Sir Francis Varney would he very happy to see Admiral
Bell.

     "Ay, ay," he muttered; "just as the devil likes to meet with holy 
water,
or as I like any water save salt water."

     He was speedily introduced to Sir Francis Varney, who was seated in the
same posture as he had been left by Henry Bannerworth not many minutes 
before.

     "Admiral Bell," said Sir Francis, rising, and bowing to that individual
in the most polite, calm, and dignified manner imaginable, "permit me to
express the honour I feel at this unexpected visit."

     "None of your gammon."

     "Will you be seated.  Allow me to offer you such refreshments as this
poor house affords."

     "D--n all this!  You know, Sir Francis, I don't want none o' this
palaver.  It's for all the world like a Frenchman, when you are going to 
give
him a broadside; he makes grimaces, throws dust in your eyes, and tries to
stab you in the back.  Oh, no! none of that for me."

     "I should say not, Admiral Bell.  I should not like it myself, and I 
dare
say you are a man of too much experience not to perceive when you are or are
not imposed upon."

     "Well, what is that to you?  D--n me, I didn't come here to talk to you
about myself."

     "Then may I presume upon your courtesy so far as to beg that you will
enlighten me upon the object of your visit?"

     "Yes; in pretty quick time.  Just tell me where you have stowed away my
nephew, Charles Holland?"

     "Really, I -- "

     "Hold your slack, will you, and hear me out; if he's living, let him 
out,
and I'll say no more about it; that's liberal, you know; it ain't terms
everybody would offer you."

     "I must, in truth, admit they are not; and, moreover, they quite 
surprise
even me, and I have learned not to be surprised at almost anything."

     "Well, will you give him up alive? but, hark ye, you mustn't have made
very queer fish of him, do ye see?"

     "I hear you," said Sir Francis, with a bland smile, passing one hand
gently over the other, and showing his front teeth in a peculiar manner; 
"but
I really cannot comprehend all this; but I may say, generally, that Mr.
Holland is no acquaintance of mine, and I have no sort of knowledge where he
may be."

     "That won't do for me," said the admiral, positively, shaking his head.

     "I am particularly sorry, Admiral Bell, that it will not, seeing that I
have nothing else to say."

     "I see how it is; you've put him out of the way, and I'm d----d if you
shan't' bring him to life, whole and sound, or I'll know the reason why."

     "With that I have already furnished you, Admiral Bell," quietly 
rejoined
Varney; "anything more on that head is out of my power, although my
willingness to oblige a person of such consideration as yourself, is very
great; but, permit me to add, this is a very strange and odd communication
from one gentleman to another.  You have lost a relative, who has, very
probably, taken some offence, or some notion into his head, of which nobody
but himself knows anything, and you come to one yet more unlikely to know
anything of him, than even yourself."

     "Gammon again, now, Sir Francis Varney, or Blarney."

     "Varney, if you please, Admiral Bell; I was christened Varney."

     "Christened, eh?"

     "Yes, christened -- were you not christened?  If not, I dare say you
understand the ceremony well enough."

     "I should think I did; but, as for christening, a-- "

     "Go on, sir."

     "A vampyre! why I should as soon think of reading the burial service of 
a
pig."

     "Very possible; but what has all this to do with your visit to me?"

     "This much, you lubber.  Now, d--n my carcass from head to stern, if I
don't call you out."

     "Well, Admiral Bell," said Varney, mildly, "in that case, I suppose I
must come out; but why do you insist that I have any knowledge of your 
nephew,
Mr. Charles Holland?"

     "You were to have fought a duel with him, and now he's gone."

     "I am here," said Varney.

     "Ay," said the admiral, "that's as plain as a purser's shirt upon a
handspike; but that's the very reason why my nevey ain't here, and that's 
all
about it."

     "And that's marvellous little, so far as the sense is concerned," said
Varney, without the movement of a muscle.

     "It is said that people of your class don't like fighting mortal men; 
now
you have disposed of him, lest he should dispose of you."

     "That is explicit, but it is to no purpose, since the gentleman in
question hasn't placed himself at my disposal."

     "Then, d---e, I will; fish, flesh, or fowl, I don't care; all's one to
Admiral Bell.  Come fair or foul, I'm a tar for all men; a seaman ever ready
to face a foe, so here goes, you lubberly moon manufactured calf."

     "I hear, admiral, but it is scarcely civil, to say the least of it;
however, as you are somewhat eccentric, and do not, I dare say, mean all 
your
words imply, I am quite willing to make every allowance."

     "I don't want any allowance; d--n you and your allowance, too; nothing
but allowance of grog, and a pretty good allowance, too, will do for me, and 
I
tell you, Sir Francis Varney," said the admiral, with much wrath, "that you
are a d----d lubberly hound, and I'll fight you; yes, I'm ready to hammer
away, or with anything from a pop-gun to a ship's gun; you don't come over 
me
with your gammon, I tell you.  You've murdered Charles Holland because you
couldn't face him -- that's the truth of it."

     "With the other part of your speech, Admiral Bell, allow me to say, you
have mixed up a serious accusation -- one I cannot permit to pass lightly."

     "Will you or not fight?"

     "Oh, yes; I shall be happy to serve you any way that I can. I hope this
will be an answer to your accusation, also."

     "That's settled, then."

     "Why, I am not captious, Admiral Bell, but it is not generally usual 
for
the principals to settle the preliminaries themselves; doubtless you, in 
your
career of fame and glory know something of the manner in which gentlemen
demean themselves on these occasions."

     "Oh, d--n you!  Yes, I'll send some one to do all this. Yes, yes, Jack
Pringle will be the man, though Jack ain't a holiday, shore-going, smooth-
spoken swab, but as good a seaman as ever trod deck or handled a boarding-
pike."

     "Any friend of yours," said Varney, blandly, "will be received and
treated as such upon an errand of such consequence; and now our conference
has, I presume, concluded."

     "Yes, yes, we've done-- d---e, no-- yes-- no.  I will keel-haul you but
I'll know something of my neavy, Charles Holland."

     "Good day, Admiral Bell."  As Varney spoke, he placed his hand upon the
bell which he had near him, to summon an attendant to conduct the admiral 
out.
The latter, who had said a vast deal more than he ever intended, left the 
room
in a great rage, protesting to himself that he would amply avenge his 
nephew,
Charles Holland.

     He proceeded homeward, considerably vexed and annoyed that he had been
treated with so much calmness, and all knowledge of his nephew denied.

     When he got back, he quarrelled heartily with Jack Pringle -- made it 
up -
- drank grog -- quarrelled -- made it up, and finished with grog again --
until he went to bed swearing he should like to fire a broadside at the 
whole
of the French army, and annihilate it at once.

     With this wish, he fell asleep.

     Early next morning, Henry Bannerworth sought Mr. Chillingworth, and
having found him, he said in a serious tone, --

     "Mr. Chillingworth, I have rather a serious favour to ask you, and one
which you may hesitate in granting."

     "It must be very serious indeed," said Mr. Chillingworth, "that I 
should
hesitate to grant it to you; but pray inform me what it is what you deem so
serious?"

     "Sir Francis Varney and I must have a meeting," said Henry.

     "Have you really determined upon such a course?" said Mr. 
Chillingworth;
"You know the character of your adversary?"

     "That is all settled, -- I have given a challenge, and he has accepted
it; so all other considerations verge themselves into one-- and that is the
when, where, and how."

     "I see," said Mr. Chillingworth.  "Well, since it cannot be helped on
your part, I will do what is requisite for you-- do you wish anything to be
done or insisted on in particular in this affair."

     "Nothing with regard to Sir Francis Varney that I may not leave to your
discretion.  I feel convinced that he is the assassin of Charles Holland, 
whom
he feared to fight in duel."

     "Then there remains but little else to do, but to arrange 
preliminaries,
I believe.  Are you prepared on every other point?"

     "I am-- you will see that I am the challenger, and that he must now
fight.  What accident may turn up to save him, I fear not, but sure I am, 
that
he will endeavour to take every advantage that may arise, and so escape the
encounter."

     "And what do you imagine he will do now he has accepted your 
challenge?"
said Mr. Chillingworth; "one would imagine he could not very well escape."

     "No-- but he accepted the challenge which Charles Holland sent him-- a
duel was inevitable, and it seems to me to be a necessary consequence that 
he
disappeared from amongst us, for Mr. Holland would never have shrunk from 
the
encounter."

     "There can be no sort of suspicion about that," remarked Chillingworth;
"but allow me to advise you that you take care of yourself, and keep a
watchful eye upon everyone-- do not be seen out alone."

     "I fear not."

     "Nay, the gentleman who has disappeared was, I am sure, fearless 
enough;
but yet that has not saved him.  I would not advise you to be fearful, only
watchful; you have now an event awaiting upon you which it is well you 
should
go through with, unless circumstances should so turn out, that it is 
needless;
wherefore I say, when you have the suspicions you do entertain of this man's
conduct, beware, be cautious, and vigilant."

     "I will do so-- in the mean time, I trust myself confidently in your
hands-- you know all that is necessary."

     "This affair is quite a secret from all of the family?"

     "Most certainly so, and will remain so-- I shall be at the Hall."

     "And there I will see you-- but be careful not to be drawn into any
adventure of any kind-- it is best to be on the safe side under all
circumstances."

     "I will be especially careful, be assured, but farewell; see Sir 
Francis
Varney as early as you can, and let the meeting be as early as you can, and
thus diminish the chance of accident."

     "That I will attend to.  Farewell for the present."

     Mr. Chillingworth immediately set about the conducting of the affair 
thus
confided to him; and that no time might be lost, he determined to set out at
once for Sir Francis Varney's residence.

     "Things with regard to this family seem to have gone on wild of late,"
thought Mr. Chillingworth; "this may bring affairs to a conclusion, though I
had much rather they had come to some other. My life for it, there is a 
juggle
or a mystery, somewhere; I will do this, and then we shall see what will 
come
of it; if this Sir Francis Varney  meets him-- and at this moment I can see
no reason why he should not do so-- it will tend much to deprive him of the
mystery about him; but if, on the other hand, he refuse-- but then that's 
all
improbable, because he has agreed to do so.  I fear however, that such a man
as Varney is a dreadful enemy to encounter-- he is cool and unruffled-- and
that gives him all the advantage in such affairs; but Henry's nerves are not
bad, though shaken by these untoward events; but time will show-- I would it
were all over."

     With these thoughts and feelings strangely intermixed, Mr. 
Chillingworth
set forward for Sir Francis Varney's house.

                 *              *              *             *

     Admiral Bell slept soundly enough, though, towards morning, he fell 
into
a strange dream, and thought he was yard arm and yard arm with a strange 
fish
-- something of the mermaid species.

     "Well," exclaimed the admiral, after a customary benediction of his 
eyes
and limbs, "what's to come next? may I be spliced to a shark if I understand
what this is all about.  I had some grog last night, but then grog, d'y'see,
is a seaman's native element, as the newspapers say, though I never read 'em
now, it's such a plague."

     He lay quiet for a short time, considering in his own mind what was 
best
to be done and what was the proper course to pursue and why he should dream.

     "Hilloa, hilloa, hil--loa Jack a-hoy! a-hoy!" shouted the admiral, as a
sudden recollection of his challenge came across his memory; "Jack Pringle
a-hoy? d--n you, where are you? -- you're never at hand when you are wanted. 
Oh, you lubber, -- a-hoy !"

     "A-hoy!" shouted a voice, as the door opened, and Jack thrust his head
in; "what cheer, messmate? what ship is this?"

     "Oh, you lubberly-- "

     The door was shut in a minute, and Jack Pringle disappeared.

     "Hilloa, Jack Pringle, you don't mean to say you'll desert your 
colours,
do you, you dumb dog?"

     "Who, says I'll desert the ship as she's sea-worthy? "

     "Then why do you go away?"

     "Because I won't be called lubberly, I'm as good a man as ever swabbed 
a
deck, and don't care who says to the contrary. I'll stick to the ship as 
long
as she's sea-worthy," said Jack.

     "Well, come here, and just listen to the log, and be d----d to you."

     "What's the orders now, admiral?" said Jack, "though, as we are paid
off--"

     "There, take that, will you?" said Admiral Bell, as he flung a pillow 
at
Jack, being the only thing in the shape of a missile within reach.

     Jack ducked, and the pillow produced a clatter in the washhand-stand
among the crockery, as Jack said, --

     "There's a mutiny in the ship, and hark how the cargo clatters; will 
you
have it back again?"

     "Come, will you? I've been dreaming, Jack."

     "Dreaming! what's that?"

     "Thinking of something when you are asleep, you swab."

     "Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Jack; "never did such a thing in my life-- ha, 
ha,
ha! what's the matter now?"

     "I'll tell you what's the matter, Jack Pringle, you are becoming
mutinous, and I won't have it; if you don't hold your jaw and draw in your
slacks, I'll have another second."

     "Another second! what's in the wind, now?" said Jack.  "Is this the
dream?"

     "If ever I dream when I'm alongside a strange craft, then it is a 
dream;
but old Admiral Bell ain't the man to sleep when there's any work to be 
done."

     "That's uncommon true," said Jack, turning a quid.

     "Well, then, I'm to fight."

     "Fight!" exclaimed Jack.  "Avast, there, I don't see where's the enemy-
-
none o' that gammon; Jack Pringle can fight, too, and will lay alongside his
admiral, but he don't see the enemy anywhere."

     "You don't understand these things, so I'll tell you.  I have had a bit
of talk with Sir Francis Varney, and I am going to fight him."

     "What the _wamphigher_?" remarked Jack, parenthetically.

     "Yes."

     "Well, then," resumed Jack, "then we shall see another blaze, at least
afore we die; but he's an odd fish-- one of Davy Jones's sort."

     "I don't care about that; he may be anything he likes; but Admiral Bell
ain't a-going to have his nephew burned and eaten, and sucked like don't 
know
what, by a vampyre, or by any other confounded land-shark."

     "In course," said Jack, "we ain't a-going to put up with nothing of 
that
sort, and if so be as how he has put him out of the way, why it's our duty 
to
send him arter him, and square the board."

     "That's the thing, Jack; now you know you must go to Sir Francis Varney
and tell him you come from me."

     "I don't care if I goes on my own account," said Jack.

     "That won't do; I've challenged him, and I must fight him."

     "In course you will," returned Jack; "and, if he blows you away, why 
I'll
take your place, and have a blaze myself."

     The admiral gave a look at Jack of great admiration, and then said, --

     "You are a d----d good seaman, Jack, but he's a knight, and might say 
no
to that; but do you go to him, and tell him that you come from me to settle
the when and the where this duel is to be fought."

     "Single fight?" said Jack.

     "Yes; consent to any thing that is fair," said the admiral, "but let it
be as soon as you can.  Now do you understand what I have said?"

     "Yes, to be sure; I ain't lived all these years without knowing your
lingo."

     "Then go at once; and don't let the honour of Admiral Bell and old
England suffer, Jack.  I'm his man, you know, at any price."

     "Never fear," said Jack; "you shall fight him, at any rate. I'll go and
see he don't back out, the warmint."

     "Then go along, Jack; and mind don't you go blazing away like a fire
ship, and letting everybody know what's going on, or it'll be stopped."

     "I'll not spoil sport," said Jack, as he left the room, to go at once 
to
Sir Francis Varney, charged with the conducting of the important cartel of 
the
admiral.  Jack made the best of his way with becoming gravity and expedition
until he reached the gate of the admiral's enemy.

     Jack rang loudly at the gate; there seemed, if one might judge by his
countenance, a something on his mind, that Jack was, almost another man.  
The
gate was opened by the servant, who inquired what he wanted there.

     "The wamphigher."

     "Who?"

     "The wamphigher."

     The servant frowned, and was about to say something uncivil to Jack, 
who
looked at him very hard, and then said, --

     "Oh, may be you don't know him, or won't know him by that name:  I 
wants
to see Sir Francis Varney."

     "He's at home," said the servant; "who are you?"

     "Show me up, then.  I'm Jack Pringle, and I'm come from Admiral Bell; 
I'm
the admiral's friend, you see, so none of your black looks."

     The servant seemed amazed, as well as rather daunted, at Jack's 
address;
he showed him, however, into the hall, where Mr. Chillingworth had just that
moment arrived, and was waiting for an interview with Varney.

 Next Time: Marchdale's Offer. -- The Consultation at Bannerworth Hall. --
 The Morning of the Duel.




                             Chapter XXXVIII.

MARCHDALE'S OFFER. -- THE CONSULTATION AT BANNERWORTH HALL. --  THE MORNING 
OF
THE DUEL.


     Mr. Chillingworth was much annoyed to see Jack Pringle in  the hall and
Jack was somewhat surprised at seeing Mr. Chillingworth there at that time 
in
the morning; they had but little time to indulge in their mutual 
astonishment,
for a  servant came to announce that Sir Francis Varney would see them  
both.

     Without saying anything to the servant or each other, they ascended the
staircase, and were shown into the apartment where Sir Francis Varney 
received
them.

     "Gentlemen," said Sir Francis, in his usual bland tone,  "you are
welcome."

     "Sir Francis," said Mr. Chillingworth, "I have come upon matters of 
some
importance; may I crave a separate audience?"

     "And I too," said Jack Pringle; "I come as the friend of Admiral Bell, 
I
want a private audience; but, stay, I don't care a rope's end who knows who 
I
am, or what I come about; say you  are ready to name time and place, and I'm
as dumb as a figurehead; that is saying something, at all events; and now 
I'm 
done."

     "Why, gentlemen," said Sir Francis, with a quiet smile, "as you have 
both
come upon the same errand, and as there may arise  a controversy upon the
point of precedence, you had better be both present, as I must arrange this
matter myself upon due inquiry."

     "I do not exactly understand this," said Mr. Chillingworth; "do you, 
Mr.
Pringle? perhaps you can enlighten me?"

     "If," said Jack, "as how you came here upon the same errand as I, and I
as you, why we both come about fighting Sir Francis Varney."

     "Yes," said Sir Francis; "what Mr. Pringle says, is, I believe correct 
to
a letter.  I have a challenge from both your principals, and am ready to 
give
you both the satisfaction you desire, provided the first encounter will 
permit
me the honour  of joining in the second.  You, Mr. Pringle, are aware of the 
chances of war?"

     "I should say so," said Jack, with a wink and a nod  of a familiar
character.  "I've seen a few of them."

     "Will you proceed to make the necessary agreement between  you both
gentlemen?  My affection for the one equals fully the  good will I bear the
other, and I cannot give a preference in so delicate a matter; proceed
gentlemen."

     Mr. Chillingworth looked at Jack, and Jack Pringle looked  at Mr.
Chillingworth, and then the former said, --

     "Well, the admiral means fighting, and I am come to settle the
necessaries; pray let me know what are your terms, Mr. What-d'ye-call'em."

     "I am agreeable to anything that is at all reasonable -- pistols, I
presume?"

     "Sir Francis Varney," said Mr. Chillingworth, "I cannot consent to 
carry
on this  office, unless you can appoint a friend who will settle these 
matters
with us -- myself, at least."

     "And I too," said Jack. Pringle; "we don't want to bear down an enemy. 
Admiral Bell ain't the man to do that, and if he were, I'm not the man to 
back
him in doing what isn't fair or right; but he won't do it."

     "But, gentlemen, this must not be; Mr. Henry Bannerworth must not be
disappointed, and Admiral Bell must not be disappointed. Moreover, I have
accepted the two cartels, and I am ready and willing to fight; -- one at a
time, I presume!"

     "Sir Francis, after what you have said, I must take upon myself, on the
part of Mr. Henry Bannerworth, to decline meeting you, if you cannot name a
friend with whom I can arrange this affair."

     "Ah!" said Jack Pringle, "that's right enough.  I recollect very well
when Jack Mizen fought Tom Foremast, they had their seconds.  Admiral Bell
can't do anything in the dark.  No, no, d---e! all must be above board."

     "Gentlemen," said Sir Francis Varney, "you see the dilemma I am in.  
Your
principals have both challenged me.  I am ready to fight any one, or both of
them, as the case may be.   Distinctly understand that; because it is a 
notion
of theirs that I will not do so, or that I shrink from them; but I am a
stranger in this neighbourhood, and have no one whom I could call upon to
relinquish so much, as they run the risk of doing  by attending me to the
field."

     "Then your acquaintances are no friends, d---e!" said Jack Pringle,
spitting through  his teeth into the bars of a beautifully polished grate. 
"I'd stick to anybody -- the devil himself, leave alone a vampyre -- if so 
be
as how I had been his friend and drunk from the same can.  They are a set of
lubbers."

     "I have not been here long enough to form any such friendships, Mr.
Chillingworth; but can confidently rely upon  your honour and that of your
principal, and will freely and  fairly meet him."

     "But, Sir Francis, you forget the fact, in thus acting, myself for Mr.
Bannerworth, and this person for Admiral Bell, we  do much, and have our own
characters at stake; lives and  fortunes.  These may be small, but they are
everything to us.   Allow me to say, on my own behalf, that I will not 
permit
my  principal to meet you unless you can name a second as is usual  with
gentlemen on such occasions."

     "I regret, while I declare to you my entire willingness to meet you, 
that
I cannot comply through utter inability to do so, with your request.  Let 
this
to forth to the world as I have stated it, and let it be an answer to any
aspersions that may be uttered as to my unwillingness to fight."

     There was a pause of some moments.  Mr. Chillingworth was resolved 
that,
come what would, he would not permit Henry to fight, unless Sir Francis 
Varney
himself should appoint a friend and then they I could meet upon equal terms.

     Jack Pringle whistled, and spit, and chewed and turned his quid --
hitched up his trousers, and looked whistfully from one  to the other, as he
said, --

     "So then it's likely to be no fight at all, Sir Francis What's-o'-
name?"

     "It  seems like it, Mr. Pringle," replied Varney, with a with meaning
smile; "unless I you can be more complaisant towards myself, and kindly
towards the admiral."

     "Why, not exactly that," said Jack; "it's a pity to stop a good play in
the beginning, just because some little thing is wrong in the tackling."

     "Perhaps your skill and genius may enable us to find some medium course
that we may pursue with pleasure and profit.  What say you, Mr. Pringle?"

     "All I know about genius, as you call it, is the Flying Dutchman, or 
some
such odd, out o' the way fish.  But, as I said, I am not one to spoil sport,
nor more is the admiral.  Oh, no, we is all true men and good."

     "I believe it," said Varney, bowing politely.

     "You needn't keep your figure-head on the move; I can see you just as
well.  Howsoever, as I was saying, I don't like to spoil sport, and sooner
than both parties should be disappointed, my principal shall become your
second, Sir Francis."

     "What, Admiral Bell!" exclaimed Varney, lifting his eyebrows with
surprise.

     "What, Charles Holland's uncle!" exclaimed Mr. Chillingworth, in 
accents
of amazement.

     "And why not?" said Jack, with great gravity.  "I will pledge my word -
-
Jack Pringle's word -- that Admiral Bell shall be second to Sir Francis
Varney, during his scrimmage with Mr. Henry Bannerworth.  That will let the
matter go on; there can be no back-out then, eh?" continued Jack Pringle, 
with
a knowing nod at Chillingworth as he spoke.

     "That will, I hope, remove your scruples, Mr. Chillingworth," said
Varney, with a courteous smile.

     "But will Admiral Bell do this?"

     "His second says so, and has, I daresay, influence enough with him to
induce that person to act in conformity with his promise."

     "In course he will.  Do you think he would be the man to hang back?  
Oh,
no; he would be the last to leave Jack Pringle in the lurch -- no.  Depend
upon it, Sir Francis, he'll be as sure to do what I say, as I have said it."

     "After that assurance, I cannot doubt it," said Sir Francis Varney; 
"this
act of kindness will, indeed, lay me under a deep and lasting obligation to
Admiral Bell, which I fear I shall never be able to pay."

     "You need not trouble yourself about that," said Jack Pringle; "the
admiral will credit all, and you can pay off old scores when his turn comes 
in
the field."

     "I will not forget," said Varney; "he deserves every consideration; but
now, Mr. Chillingworth, I presume that we may come to some understanding
respecting this meeting, which you were so kind as to do me the honour of
seeking."

     "I cannot object to its taking place.  I shall be most happy to meet 
your
second in the field, and arrange with him."

     "I imagine that, under the circumstances, that it will be barely
necessary to go to that length of ceremony.  Future interviews can be 
arranged
later; name the time and place, and after that we can settle all the rest on
the ground."

     "Yes," said Jack; "it will be time enough, surely, to see the admiral
when we are upon the ground.  I'll warrant the old buffer is a true brick as
ever was; there's no flinching about him."

     "I am satisfied," said Varney.

     "And I also," said Chillingworth; "but, understand, Sir Francis, any
fault for seconds makes the meeting a blank."

     "I will not doubt Mr. Pringle's honour so much as to believe it
possible."

     "I'm d----d," said Jack, "if you ain't a trump-card, and no mistake; 
it's
a great pity as you is a wamphigher."

     "The time, Mr. Chillingworth?"

     "To-morrow, at seven o'clock?" replied that gentleman.

     "The place, sir?"

     "The best place that I can think of is a level meadow half-way between
here and Bannerworth Hall; but that is your privilege, Sir Francis Varney."

     "I waive it, and am much obliged to you for the choice of the spot; it
seems of the best character imaginable.  I will be punctual."

     "I think we have nothing further to arrange now," said 
Mr.Chillingworth. 
"You will meet with Admiral Bell."

     "Certainly.  I believe there is nothing more to be done; this affair is
very satisfactorily arranged, and much better than I anticipated."

     "Good morning, Sir Francis," said Mr. Chillingworth. "Good morning."

     "Adieu," said Sir Francis, with a courteous salutation. "Good day, Mr.
Pringle, and commend me to the admiral, whose services will be of infinite
value to me."

     "Don't mention it," said Jack; "the admiral's the man as'd lend any 
body
a helping hand in case of distress like the present; and I'll pledge my word
-- Jack Pringle's too, as that he'll do what's right, and give up his turn 
to
Mr. Henry Bannerworth; cause you see he can have his I turn arterwards, you
know -- it's only waiting awhile."

     "That's all," said Sir Francis.

     Jack Pringle made a sea bow and took his leave, as he followed Mr.
Chillingworth, and they both left the house together, to return to 
Bannerworth
Hall.

     "Well," said Mr. Chillingworth, "I am glad that Sir Francis Varney has
got over the difficulty of having no seconds; for it would not be proper or
safe to meet a man without a friend with him."

     "lt ain't the right thing," said Jack, hitching up his trousers; "but I
was afeard as how he would back out, and that would be just the wrong thing
for the admiral; he'd go raving mad."

     They had got but very few paces from Sir Francis Varney's house, when
they were joined by Marchdale.

     "Ah," he said, as he came up, "I see you have been to Sir Francis
Varney's, if I may judge from the direction whence you're coming, and your
proximity."

     "Yes, we have," said Mr. Chillingworth.  "I thought you had left these
parts?"

     "I had intended to do so," replied Marchdale; "but second thoughts are
some times best, you know."

     "Certainly."

     "I have so much friendship for the family at the hall, that not
withstanding I am compelled to be absent from the mansion itself, yet I 
cannot
quit the neighbourhood while there are circumstances of such a character
hanging about them.  I will remain, and see if there be not something 
arising,
in which I may be useful to them in some matter."

     "It is very disinterested of you; you will remain here for some time, I
suppose?"

     "Yes, undoubtedly; unless, as I do not anticipate, I should see any
occasion to quit my present quarters."

     "I tell you what it is," said Jack Pringle; "if you had been here
half-an-hour earlier, you could have seconded the wamphigher."

     "Seconded!"

     "Yes, we're here to challenge."

     "A double challenge?"

     "Yes; but in confiding this matter to you, Mr. Marchdale, you will make
no use of it to the exploding of this affair.  By so doing you will 
seriously
damage the honour of Mr. Henry Bannerworth."

     "I will not, you may rely upon it; but Mr. Chillingworth, do I not see
you in the character of a second?"

     "You do, sir."

     "To Mr. Henry?"

     "The same, sir."

     "Have you reflected upon the probable consequences of such an act, 
should
any serious mischief occur?"

     "What I have undertaken, Mr. Marchdale, I will go through with; the
consequences I have duly considered, and yet you see me in the character of
Mr. Henry Bannerworth's friend."

     "I am happy to see you as such, and I do not think Henry could find a
worthier.  But this is beside the question.  What induced me to make the
remark was this, -- had I been at the hall, you will admit that Henry
Bannerworth would have chosen myself, without any disparagement to you, Mr.
Chillingworth."

     "Well sir, what then?"

     "Why I am a single man, I can live, reside and go any where; one 
country
will suit me as well as another.  I shall suffer no loss, but as for you, 
you
will be ruined in every particular; for if you go in the character of a
second, you will not be excused; for all the penalties incurred your
profession of surgeon will not excuse you."

     "I see all that, sir."

     "What I propose is, that you should accompany the parties to the field,
but in your own proper character of surgeon, and permit me to take that of
second to Mr. Bannerworth."

     "This cannot be done, unless by Mr. Henry Bannerworth's consent," said
Mr. Chillingworth.

     "Then I will accompany you to Bannerworth Hall, and see Mr. Henry, whom 
I
will request to permit me to do what I have mentioned to you."

     Mr. Chillingworth could not but admit the reasonableness of this
proposal, and it was agreed they should return to Bannerworth Hall in 
company.

     Here they arrived in a very short time after, and entered together.

      "And now," said Mr. Chillingworth, "I will go and bring our two
principals, who will be as much astonished to find themselves engaged in the
same quarrel, as I was to find myself sent on a similar errand to Sir 
Francis
with our friend Mr. John Pringle."

     "Oh, not John -- Jack Pringle, you mean," said that individual.

     Chillingworth now went in search of Henry, and sent him to the 
apartment
where Mr. Marchdale was with Jack Pringle, and then he found the admiral
waiting the return of Jack with impatience.

     "Admiral" he said, "I perceive you are unwell this morning."

     "Unwell be d----d," said the admiral, starting up with surprise.  "Who
ever heard that old Admiral Bell looked ill just afore he was going into
action?  I say it's a scandalous lie."

     "Admiral, admiral, I didn't say you were ill; only you looked ill-- a-- 
a
little nervous, or so.  Rather pale, eh?  Is it not so?"

     "Confound you, do you think I want to be physicked?  I tell you, I have
not a little but a great inclination to give you a good keelhauling.  I 
don't
want a doctor just yet."

      "But it may not be so long, you know, admiral; but there is Jack 
Pringle
a-waiting you below.  Will you go to him?  There is a particular reason; he
has something to communicate from Sir Francis Varney, I believe."

     The admiral gave a look of some amazement at Mr. Chillingworth, and 
then
he said, muttering to himself, --

     "If Jack Pringle should have betrayed me -- but, no; he could not do
that, he is too true.  I'm sure of Jack; and how did that son of a gallipot
hint about the odd fish I sent Jack to?"

     Filled with a dubious kind of belief which he had about something he 
had
heard of Jack Pringle, he entered the room, where he met Marchdale, Jack
Pringle, and Henry Bannerworth. Immediately afterwards, Mr. Chillingworth
entered the apartment.

     "I have," said he, "been to Sir Francis Varney, and there had an
interview with him, and with Mr. Pringle; when I found we were both intent
upon the same object, namely, an encounter with the knight by our 
principals."

     "Eh?" said the admiral.

     "What!" exclaimed Henry; "had he challenged you, admiral?"

     "Challenged me!" exclaimed Admiral Bell, with a round oath. "I--
however-- since it comes to this, I must admit I challenged him."

     "That's what I did," said Henry Bannerworth, after a moment's thought;
"and I perceive we have both fallen into the same line of conduct."

     "That is the fact," said Mr. Chillingworth.  "Both Mr. Pringle and I 
went
there to settle the preliminaries, and we found an insurmountable bar to any
meeting taking place at all."

     "He wouldn't fight, then?" exclaimed Henry. "I see it all now."

     "Not fight!" said Admiral Bell with a sort of melancholy 
disappointment. 
"D--n the cowardly rascal!  Tell me, Jack Pringle, what did the long
horse-marine-looking slab say to it? He told me he would fight.  Why he 
ought
to be made to stand sentry over the wind."

     "You challenged him in person, too, I suppose?" said Henry.

     "Yes, confound him!  I went there last night."

     "And I too."

     "It seems to me," said Marchdale, "that this affair has been not
indiscretely conducted; but somewhat unusually and strangely, to say the 
least
of it."

     "You see," said Chillingworth, "Sir Francis was willing to fight both
Henry and the admiral, as he told us."

     "Yes," said Jack; "he told us he would fight us both, if so be as his
light was not doused in the first brush."

     "That was all that was wanted," said the admiral.  "We could expect no
more."

     "But then he desired to meet you without any second; but, of course, I
would not accede to this proposal.  The responsibility was too great and too
unequally borne by the parties engaged in the rencontre."

     "Decidedly," said Henry; "but it is unfortunate -- very unfortunate."

     "Very," said the admiral -- "very.  What a rascally thing it is there
ain't another rogue in the country to keep him in countenance."

     "I thought it was a pity to spoil sport" said Jack Pringle. "It was a
pity a good intention should be spoiled, and I promised the wamphigher that 
if
as how he would fight, you should second him and you'd meet him to do so."

     "Eh! who? I?" exclaimed the admiral, in some perplexity.

     "Yes; that is the truth," said Mr. Chillingworth.  "Mr. Pringle said 
you
would do so, and he then and there pledged his word that you should meet him
on the ground and second him on it."

     "Yes," said Jack. "You must do it.  I knew you would not spoil sport, 
and
that there had better be a fight than no fight. I believe you'd sooner see a
scrimmage than none, and so it's all arranged."

     "Very well," said the admiral; "I only I wish Mr. Henry Bannerworth had
been his second; I think I was entitled to the first meeting."

     "No," said Jack, "you warn't, for Mr. Chillingworth was there first;
first come first served, you know."

     "Well, well, I mustn't grumble at another other man's luck; mine'll 
come
in turn; but it had better be so than a disappointment altogether; I'll be
second to this Sir Francis Varney; he shall have fair play, as I'm an 
admiral;
but, d---e he shall fight -- yes, yes, he shall fight."

     "And to this conclusion I would come," said Henry, "I wish him to 
fight;
now I will take care that he shall not have any opportunity of putting me on
one side quietly."

     "There is one thing," observed Marchdale, "that I wished to propose. 
After what has passed, I should not have returned, had I not some 
presentiment
that something was going forward in which I could be useful to my friend."

     "Oh!" said the admiral, with a huge twist of his countenance.

     "What I was about to say was this, -- Mr. Chillingworth has much to 
lose
as he is situated, and I nothing as I am placed; I am chained down to no 
spot
of earth.  I am above following a profession -- my means, I mean, place me
above the necessity. Now, Henry, allow me to be your second in this affair;
allow Mr. Chillingworth to attend in his professional capacity; he may be of
service -- of great service to one of the principals; whereas, if he go in 
any
other capacity, he will inevitably have his own safety to consult."

     "That is most unquestionably true," said Henry, "and, to my mind, the
best plan that can be proposed.  What say you, Admiral Bell, will you act 
with
Mr. Marchdale in this affair?"

     "Oh, I! -- Yes -- certainly -- I don't care.  Mr. Marchdale is Mr.
Marchdale, I believe, and that's all I care about.  If we quarrel to-day, 
and
have anything to do to-morrow,  in course, to-morrow I can put off my 
quarrel
for next day; it will keep, -- that's all I have to say at present."

     "Then this is a final arrangement?" said Mr. Chillingworth.

     "It is."

     "But, Mr. Bannerworth, in resigning my character of second to Mr.
Marchdale, I only do so because it appears and seems to be the opinion of 
all
present that I can be much better employed in another capacity."

     "Certainly, Mr. Chillingworth; and I cannot but feel that I am under 
the
same obligations to you for the readiness and zeal with which you have 
acted."

     "I have done what I have done," said Chillingworth, -- "because I
believed it was my duty to do so."

     "Mr. Chillingworth has undoubtedly acted most friendly and efficiently
this affair," said Marchdale; "and he does not relinquish the part for the
purpose of escaping a friendly deed, but to perform one in which he may act 
in
a capacity that no one else can."

     "That is true," said the admiral.

     "And now," said Chillingworth, "you are to meet to-morrow morning in 
the
meadow at the bottom of the valley, half way between here and Sir Francis
Varney's house, at seven o'clock in the morning."

     More conversation passed among them, and it was agreed that they should
meet early the next morning, and that, of course, the affair should be kept 
a
secret.  Marchdale for that night should remain in the house, and the 
admiral
should appear as if little or nothing was the matter; and he and Jack 
Pringle
retired, to talk over in private all the arrangements.

     Henry Bannerworth and Marchdale also retired, and Mr. Chillingworth,
after a time, retired, promising to be with them in time for the meeting 
next
morning.

     Much of that day was spent by Henry Bannerworth in his own apartment, 
in
writing documents and letters of one kind and another; but at night he had 
not
finished, for he had been compelled to be about, and in Flora's presence, to
prevent anything from being suspected.

     Marchdale was much with him, and in secret examined the arms, 
ammunition,
and bullets, and saw all was right for the next morning; and when he had 
done,
he said, --

     "Now, Henry, you must permit me to insist that you take some hours'
repose, else you will scarcely be as you ought to be."

     "Very good," said Henry. "I have just finished, and can take your
advice."

     After many thoughts and reflections, Henry Bannerworth fell into a deep
sleep, and slept several hours in calmness and quietude, and at an early 
hour
he awoke, and saw Marchdale sitting by him.

     "Is it time, Marchdale?  I have not overslept myself, have I?"

     "No; time enough -- time enough," said Marchdale. "I should have let 
you
sleep longer, but I should have awakened you in good time."

     It was now the grey light of morning, and Henry arose and began to
prepare for the encounter.  Marchdale stole to Admiral Bell's chamber, but 
he
and Jack Pringle were ready.

     Few words were spoken, and those few were in a whisper, and the whole
party left the Hall in as noiseless a manner was possible.  It was a mild
morning, and yet it was cold at that time of the morning, just as day is
beginning to dawn in the east.  There was, however, ample time to reach the
rendezvous.

     It was a curious party that which was now proceeding towards the spot
appointed for the duel, the result of which might have so important an 
effect
on the interests of those who were to be engaged in it.

     It would be difficult for us to analyse the different and conflicting
emotions that filled the breasts of the various individuals composing that
party -- the hopes and fears -- the doubts and surmises that were given
utterance to; though we are compelled to acknowledge that though to Henry, 
the
character of the man he was going to meet in mortal fight was of a most
ambiguous and undefined nature, and though no one could imagine the means he
might be endowed with for protection against the arms of man -- Henry, as we
said, strode firmly forward with unflinching resolution.  His heart was set 
on
recovering the happiness of his sister, and he would not falter.

     So far, then, we may consider that at length proceedings of a hostile
character were so far clearly and fairly arranged between Henry Bannerworth
and that most mysterious being who certainly, from some cause or another, 
had
betrayed no inclination to meet an opponent in that manner which is
sanctioned, bad as it is, by the usages of society.

     But whether his motive was one of cowardice or mercy, remained yet to 
be
seen.  It might be that he feared himself receiving some mortal injury, 
which
would at once put a stop to that preternatural career of existence which he
affected to shudder at, and yet evidently took considerable pains to 
prolong.

     Upon the other hand, it is just possible that some consciousness of
invulnerability on his own part, or of great power to injure his antagonist,
might be the cause why he had held back so long from fighting the duel, and
placed so many obstacles in the way of the usual necessary arrangements
incidental to such occasions.

     Now, however, there would seem to be no possible means of escape.  Sir
Francis Varney must fight or fly, for he was surrounded by too many 
opponents.

     To be sure he might have appealed to the civil authorities to protect
him, and to sanction him in his refusal to commit what undoubtedly is a 
legal
offence; but then there cannot be a question that the whole of the
circumstances would come out, and meet the public eye -- the result of which
would be, his acquisition of a reputation, as unenviable as it would be
universal.

     It had so happened, that the peculiar position of the Bannerworth 
family
kept their acquaintance within extremely narrow limits, and greatly 
indisposed
them to set themselves up as marks for peculiar observation.  Once holding, 
as
they had, a proud position in the county, and being looked upon as quite
magnates of the land, they did not now court the prying eye of curiosity to
look upon their poverty; but rather with a gloomy melancholy they lived 
apart,
and repelled the advances of society by a cold reserve which few could break
through.

     Had this family suffered in any noble cause, or had the misfortunes 
which
had come over them, and robbed their ancestral house of its lustre, been an
unavoidable dispensation of providence, they would have borne the hard
position with a different aspect; but it must be remembered, that to the
faults, the vices, and the criminality of some of their race, was to be
attributed their present depressed state.

     It has been seen during the progress of our tale, that its action has
been tolerably confined to Bannerworth Hall, its adjacent meadows, and the
seat of Sir Francis Varney; the only person at any distance, knowing 
anything
of the circumstances, or feeling any interest in them, being Mr.
Chillingworth, the surgeon, who, from personal feeling, as well as from
professional habit, was not likely to make a family's affairs a subject of
gossip.

     A change, however, was at hand -- a change of a most startling and
alarming character to Varney -- one which he might expect, yet not be well
prepared for.

     This period of serenity was to pass away, and he was to become most
alarmingly popular.  We will not, however, anticipate, but proceed at once 
to
detail as briefly as may be the hostile meeting.

     It would appear that Varney, now that he had once consented to the
definitive arrangements of a duel, shrunk not in any way from carrying them
out, nor in the slightest attempted to retard arrangements which might be
fatal to himself.

     The early morning was one of those cloudy ones so frequently occurring 
in
our fickle climate, when the cleverest weather prophet would find it 
difficult
to predict what the next hour might produce.

     There was a kind of dim gloominess over all objects; and as there were 
no
bright lights there were no deep shadows -- the consequence of which was a
sameness of effect over the landscape, that robbed it of many of its usual
beauties.

     Such was the state of things when Marchdale accompanied Henry and 
Admiral
Bell from Bannerworth Hall across the garden in the direction of the hilly
wood, close to which was the spot intended for the scene of encounter.

     Jack Pringle came on at a lazy pace behind with his hands in his 
pockets,
and looking as unconcerned as if he had just come out for a morning's 
stroll,
and scarcely knew whether he saw what was going on or not.

     The curious contortion into which he twisted his countenance, and the
different odd-looking lumps that appeared in it from time to time, may be
accounted for by a quid of unusual size, which he seemed to be masticating
with a relish quite horrifying to one unused to so barbarous a luxury.

     The admiral had strictly enjoined him not to interfere on pain of being
considered a lubber and no seaman for the remainder of his existence --
threatened penalties which, of course, had their own weight with Jack, and
accordingly he came just to see the row in as quiet a way as possible, 
perhaps
not without a hope, that something might turn up in the shape of a _causus
belli_, that might justify him in adopting a threatening attitude towards
somebody.

     "Now, Master Henry," said the admiral, "none of your palaver to me as 
we
go along; recollect I don't belong to your party, you know.  I've stood 
friend
to two or three fellows in my time; but if anybody had said to me, 'Admiral
Bell, the next time you go out on a quiet little shooting party, it will be 
as
second to a vampyre,' I'd have said 'you're a liar.'  Howsomever, d--me, 
here
you goes, and what I mean to say is this, Mr. Henry, that I'd second even a
Frenchman rather than he shouldn't fight when he's asked."

     "That's liberal of you," said Henry, "at all events."

     "I believe you it is," said the admiral; "so mind if you don't hit him,
I'm not a-going to tell you how -- all you've got to do is, to fire low; but
that's no business of mine.  Shiver my timbers, I oughtn't to tell you, but
d--n you, hit him if you can."

     "Admiral," said Henry, "I can hardly think you are even preserving a
neutrality in the matter, putting aside my own partisanship as regards your
own man."

     "Oh! hang him.  I'm not going to let him creep out of the thing on such 
a
shabby pretence, I can tell you.  I think I ought to have gone to his house
this morning; only, as I said I never would cross his threshold again, I
won't."

     "I wonder if he'll come," said Mr. Marchdale to Henry. "After all, you
know he may take to flight, and shun an encounter which, it is evident, he 
has
entered into but tardily."

     "I hope not," said Henry; "and yet I must own that your supposition has
several times crossed my mind.  If, however, he do not meet me, he never can
appear the country, and we should, at least, be rid of him, and all his
troublesome importunities concerning the Hall.  I would not allow that man, 
on
any account, to cross the threshold of my house, as its tenant or its 
owner."

     "Why, it ain't usual," said the admiral, "to let one's house to two
people at once, unless you seem quite to forget that I've taken yours.  I 
may
as well remind you of it."

     "Hurra!" said Jack Pringle, at that moment.

     "What's the matter with you?  Who told you to hurra?"

     "Enemy in the offing," said Jack, "three or four points to the sou-
west."

     "So he is, by Jove! dodging about among the trees.  Come, now, this
vampyre's a decenter fellow than I thought him.  He means, after all, to let
us have a pop at him."

     They had now reached so close to the spot, that Sir Francis Varney, 
who,
to all appearance, had been waiting, emerged from among the trees, rolled up
in his dismal looking cloak, and, if possible, looking longer and thinner 
than
ever he had looked before.

     His face wore a singular cadaverous-looking aspect.  His very lips were
white, and there was a curious, pinkish-looking circle round each of his 
eyes,
that imparted to his whole countenance a most uninviting appearance.  He
turned his eyes from one to the other of those who were advancing towards 
him,
until he saw the admiral, upon which he gave such a grim and horrible smile,
that the old man exclaimed, --

     "I say, Jack, you lubber, there's a face for a figure-head."

     "Ay, ay, sir."

     "Did you ever see such a d----d grin as that in your life, in any
latitude?"

     "Ay, ay, sir."

     "You did, you swab."

     "I should think so."

     "It's a lie, and you know it."

     "Very good," said Jack; "don't you recollect when that ere iron bullet
walked over your head, leaving a nice little nick, all the way off
Bergen-ap-Zoom, that was the time -- blessed if you didn't give just such a
grin as that."

     "I didn't, you rascal."

     "And I say you did."

     "Mutiny, by God!"

     "Go to blazes!"

     How far this contention might have gone, having now reached its
culminating point, had the admiral and Jack been alone, it is hard to say; 
but
as it was, Henry and Marchdale interfered, and so the quarrel was patched up
for the moment, in order to give place to more important affairs.

     Varney seemed to think, that after the smiling welcome he had given to
his second, he had done quite enough; for there he stood, tall, and gaunt, 
and
motionless, if we may except an occasional singular movement of the mouth, 
and
a clap together of his teeth, at times, which was enough to make anybody 
jump
to hear.

     "For Heaven's sake," said Marchdale, "do not let us trifle at such a
moment as this.  Mr. Pringle, you really had no business here."

     "Mr. who?" said Jack.

     "Pringle, I believe, is your name?" returned Marchdale.

     "It were; but blowed if ever I was called mister before."

     The admiral walked up to Sir Francis Varney, and gave him a nod that
looked much more like one of defiance than of salutation, to which the 
vampyre
replied by a low, courtly bow.

     "Oh, bother!" muttered the old admiral.  "If I was to double up my back
bone like that, I should never get it down straight again.  Well, all's 
right;
you've come; that's all you could do, I suppose."

     "I am here," said Varney, "and therefore it becomes a work of
supererogation to remark that I've come."

     "Oh! does it?  I never bolted a dictionary, and, therefore, I don't 
know
exactly what you mean."

     "Step aside with me a moment, Admiral Bell, and I will tell you what 
you
are to do with me after I am shot, if such should be my fate."

     "Do with you!  D----d if I'll do anything with you."

     "I don't expect you will regret me; you will eat."

     "Eat!"

     "Yes, and drink as usual, no doubt, not-withstanding being witness to 
the
decease of a fellow-creature."

     "Belay there; don't call yourself a fellow-creature of mine; I ain't a
vampyre."

     "But there's no knowing what you may be; and now listen to my
instructions; for as you're my second, you cannot very well refuse to me a 
few
friendly offices.  Rain is falling.  Step beneath this ancient tree, and I
will talk to you."

 Next Time: The Storm and the Fight. -- The Admiral's Repudiation of his
 Principal.




                               Chapter XXXIX.

THE STORM AND THE FIGHT. -- THE ADMIRAL'S REPUDIATION OF HIS PRINCIPAL.


     "Well," said the admiral, when they were fairly under the tree, upon 
the
leaves of which the pattering rain might be heard falling:  "well -- what is
it?"

     "If your young friend  Mr. Bannerworth, should chance to send a pistol-
bullet through any portion of my anatomy, prejudicial to the prolongation of
my existence, you will be so good as not to interfere with anything I may 
have
about me, or to make any disturbance whatever."

     "You may depend I sha'n't."

     "Just take the matter perfectly easy -- as a thing of course."

     "Oh! I mean d----d easy."

     "Ha! what a delightful thing is friendship!  There is a little knoll or
mound of earth midway between here and the Hall. Do you happen to know it? 
There is one solitary tree growing near its summit -- an oriental looking
tree, of the fir tribe, which, fan-like, spreads its deep green leaves 
across
the azure sky."

     "Oh! bother it; it's a d----d old tree, growing upon a little bit of a
hill, I suppose you mean?"

     "Precisely; only much more poetically expressed.  The moon rises at a
quarter past four to-night, or rather to-morrow morning."

     "Does it?"

     "Yes; and if I should happen to be killed, you will have me removed
gently to this mound of earth, and there laid beneath this tree, with my 
face
upwards; and take care that it is done before the moon rises.  You can watch
that no one interferes."

     "A likely job.  What the deuce do you take me for?  I tell you what it
is, Mr. Vampyre, or Varney, or whatever's your name, if you should chance to
be hit, wherever you chance to fall, there you'll lie."

     "How very unkind."

     "Uncommon, ain't it?"

     "Well, well, since that is your determination, I must take care of 
myself
in another way.  I can do so, and I will."

     "Take care of yourself how you like, for all I care; I've come here to
second you, to see that, on the honour of a seaman, if you are put out of 
the
world, it's done in proper manner, that's all I have to do with you -- now 
you
know."

     Sir Francis Varney looked after him with a strange kind of smile, as he
walked away to make the necessary preparations with Marchdale for the
immediate commencement of the contest.

     These were simple and brief.  It was agreed that twelve paces should be
measured out, six each way, from a fixed point; one six to be paced by the
admiral, and the other by Marchdale; then they were to draw lots, to see at
which end of this imaginary line Varney was to be placed; after this the
signal for firing was to be one, two, three -- fire!

     A few minutes sufficed to complete these arrangements; the ground was
measured in the manner we have stated, and the combatants placed in their
respective positions, Sir Francis Varney occupying the same spot where he 
had
at first stood, namely, that nearest to the little wood, and to his own
residence.

     It is impossible that under such circumstances the bravest and the
calmest of mankind could fail to feel some slight degree of tremour, or
uneasiness; and, although we can fairly claim for Henry Bannerworth that he
was as truly courageous as any right feeling Christian man could wish to be,
yet when it was possible that he stood within, as it were, a hair's breadth 
of
eternity, a strange world of sensation and emotions found a home in his 
heart,
and he could not look altogether undaunted all on that future which might, 
for
all he knew to the contrary, be so close at hand, as far as he was 
concerned.

     It was not that he feared death, but that he looked with a decent 
gravity
upon so grave a change as that from this world to the next, and hence it was
that his face was pale, and that he looked all the emotion which he really
felt.

     This was the aspect and the bearing of a brave but not a reckless man;
while Sir Francis Varney, on the other hand, seemed, now that he had fairly
engaged in the duel, to look upon it and all its attendant circumstances 
with
a kind of smirking satisfaction, as if he were far more amused than 
personally
interested.

     This was certainly the more extraordinary after the manner in which he
had tried to evade the fight, and, at all events, was quite a sufficient 
proof
that cowardice had not been his actuating motive in so doing.

     The admiral, who stood on a level with him, could not see the sort of
expression he wore, or, probably, he would have been far from well pleased;
but the others did, and they found something inexpressibly disagreeable in 
the
smirking kind of satisfaction with which the vampyre seemed to regard now 
the
proceedings.

     "Confound him," whispered Marchdale to Henry, "one would think he was
quite delighted, instead as we had imagined him, not well pleased, at these
proceedings; look how he grins."

     "It is no matter," said Henry; "let him wear what aspect he may, it is
the same to me; and, as Heaven is my judge, I here declare, if I did not 
think
myself justified in so doing, I would not raise my hand against this man."

     "There can be no shadow of a doubt regarding your justification.  Have 
at
him, and Heaven protect you."

     "Amen!"

     The admiral was to give the word to fire, and now he and Marchdale 
having
stepped sufficiently on one side to be out of all possible danger from any
stray shot, he commenced repeating the signal, --

     "Are you ready, gentlemen? -- once."

     They looked sternly at each other and each grasped his pistol.

     "Twice!"

     Sir Francis Varney smiled and looked around him, as if the affair were
one of the most common-place description.

     "Thrice!"

     Varney seemed to be studying the sky rather than attending to the duel.

     "Fire!" cried the admiral, and one report only struck upon the ear.  It
was that from Henry's pistol.

     All eyes were turned upon Sir Francis Varney, who had evidently 
reserved
his fire, for what purpose could not be devised, except a murderous one, the
taking of a more steady aim at Henry.  Sir Francis, however, seemed in no
hurry, but smiled, significantly, and gradually raised the point of his
weapon.

     "Did you hear the word, Sir Francis?  I gave it loud enough, I am sure. 
I never spoke plainer in my life; did I ever, Jack?"

     "Yes, often," said Jack Pringle; "what's the use of your asking such
yarns as them? you know you have done so often enough when you wanted grog."

     "You d----d rascal, I'll -- I'll have your back scored, I will."

     "So you will, when you are afloat again, which you never will be -- you
are paid off, that's certain."

     "You lubberly lout, you ain't a seaman; a seaman would never mutiny
against his admiral; howsomever, do you hear, Sir Francis, I'll give the
matter up, if you don't pay some attention to me."

     Henry looked steadily at Varney, expecting every moment to feel his
bullet.  Mr. Marchdale hastily exclaimed that this was not according to 
usage.

     Sir Francis Varney took no notice, but went on elevating his weapon; 
when
it was perpendicular to the earth he fired in the air.

     "I had not anticipated this," said Marchdale, as he walked to Henry.  
"I
thought he was taking a more deadly aim."

     "And I," said Henry.

     "Ay, you have escaped, Henry; let me congratulate you."

     "Not so fast; we may fire again."

     "I can afford to do that," he said, with a smile.

     "You should have fired, sir, according to custom," said the admiral;
"this is not the proper thing."

     "What, fire at your friend?"

     "Oh, that's all very well!  You are my friend for a time, vampyre as 
you
are and I intend you shall fire."

     "If Mr. Henry Bannerworth demands another fire, I have no objection to 
it
and will fire at him: but as it is I shall not do so, indeed, it would be
quite useless for him to do so -- to point mortal weapons at me is mere
child's play, they will not hurt me."

     "The devil they won't," said the admiral.

     "Why, look you here," said Sir Francis Varney, stepping forward and
placing his hand to his neckerchief; "look you here; if Mr. Henry 
Bannerworth
should demand another fire, he may do so with the same bullet."

     "The same bullet!" said Marchdale, stepping forward -- "the same 
bullet! 
How is this?"

     "My eyes," said Jack; "who'd a thought it; here's a go! wouldn't he do
for a dummy -- to lead a forlorn hope, or to put in among the boarders?"

     "Here," said Sir Francis, handing a bullet to Henry Bannerworth -- 
"here
is the bullet you shot at me."

     Henry looked at it -- it was blackened by powder; and then Marchdale
seized it and tried it in the pistol, but found the bullet fitted Henry's
weapon.

     "By heaven, it is so!" he exclaimed, stepping back and looking at 
Varney
from top to toe in horror and amazement.

     "D---e," said the admiral, "if I understand this.  Why Jack Pringle, 
you
dog, here's a strange fish."

     "Oh, no! there's plenty on 'um in some countries."

     "Will you insist upon another fire, or may I consider you satisfied?"

     "I shall object," said Marchdale.  "Henry, this affair must go no
further; it would be madness -- worse than madness, to fight upon such 
terms."

     "So say I," said the admiral.  "I will not have anything to do with 
you,
Sir Francis.  I'll not be your second any longer.  I didn't bargain for such 
a
game as this.  You might as well fight with the man in brass armour, at the
Lord Mayor's show, or the champion at a coronation."

     "Oh!" said Jack Pringle; "a man may as well fire at the back of a
halligator as a wamphigher."

     "This must be considered as having been concluded," said Mr. Marchdale.

     "No!" said Henry.

     "And wherefore not?"

     "Because I have not received his fire."

     "Heaven forbid you should."

     "I may not with honour quit the ground without another fire."

     "Under ordinary circumstances there might be some shadow of an excuse 
for
your demand; but as it is there is none.  You have neither honour nor credit
to gain by such an encounter, and certainly, you can gain no object."

     "How are we to decide this affair?  Am I considered absolved from the
accusation under which I lay, of cowardice?" inquired Sir Francis Varney, 
with
a cold smile.

     "Why, as for that," said the admiral, "I should as soon expect credit 
for
fighting behind a wall, as with a man that I couldn't hit any more than the
moon."

     "Henry; let me implore you to quit this scene; if can do no good."

     At this moment, a noise, as of human voices, was heard at a distance;
this caused a momentary pause, and the whole party stood still and listened.

     The murmurs and shouts that now arose in the distance were indistinct 
and
confused.

     "What can all this mean?" said Marchdale; "there is something very
strange about it.  I cannot imagine a cause for so usual an occurrence."

     "Nor I," said Sir Francis Varney, looking suspiciously at Henry
Bannerworth.

     "Upon my honour I know neither what is the cause nor the nature of the
sounds themselves."

     "Then we can easily see what is the matter from yonder hillock," said 
the
admiral; "and there's Jack Pringle, he's up there already.  What's he
telegraphing about in that manner, I wonder?"

     The fact was, Jack Pringle, hearing the riot, had thought that if he 
got
to the neighbouring eminence he might possibly ascertain what it was that 
was
the cause of what he termed the "row," and had succeeded in some degree.

     There were a number of people of all kinds coming out from the village,
apparently armed, and shouting.  Jack Pringle hitched up his trousers and
swore, then took off his hat and began to shout to the admiral, as he said, 
--

     "D---e, they are too late to spoil the in sport.  Hilloa! hurrah!"

     "What's all that about, Jack?" inquired the admiral, as he came puffing
along.  "What's the squall about?"

     "Only a few horse-marines and bumboat-women, that have been startled 
like
a company of penguins."

     "Oh! my eyes! wouldn't a whole broadside set em flying, Jack?"

     "Ay; just as them Frenchmen that you murdered on board the Big 
Thunderer,
as you called it."

     "I murder them, you rascal?"

     "Yes; there was about five hundred of them killed."

     "They were only shot."

     "They were killed, only your conscience tells you it's uncomfortable."

     "You rascal -- you villain!  You ought to be keel-hauled and well 
payed."

     "Ay; you're payed, and paid off as an old hulk."

     "D---e -- you -- you -- oh!  I wish I had you on board ship, I'd make
your lubberly carcass like a union jack, full of red and blue stripes."

     "Oh! it's all very well; but if you don't take to your heels, you'll 
have
all the old women in the village a whacking on you, that's all I have to say
about it.  You'd better port your helm and about ship, or you'll be keel-
hauled."

     "D--n your --"

     "What's the matter?" inquired Marchdale, as he arrived.

     "What's the cause of all the noise we have heard?" said Sir Francis; 
"has
some village festival spontaneously burst forth among the rustics of this
place?"

     "I cannot tell the cause of it," said Henry Bannerworth; "but they seem
to me to be coming toward this place."

     "Indeed!"

     "I think so too," said Marchdale.

     "With what object?" inquired Sir Francis Varney.

     "No peaceable one," observed Henry; "for, as far I can observe, they
struck across the country, as though they would enclose something, or
intercept somebody."

     "Indeed! but why come here?"

     "If I knew that I would have at once told the cause."

     "And they appear armed with a variety of odd weapons," observed Sir
Francis; "they mean an attack upon some one.  Who is that man with them? he
seems to be deprecating their coming."

     "That appears to be Mr. Chillingworth," said Henry; "I think that is 
he."

     "Yes," observed the admiral; "I think I know the build of that craft;
he's been in our society before.  I always know a ship as soon as I see it."

     "Does you, though?" said Jack.

     "Yes; what do you mean, eh? let me hear what you've got to say against
your captain and your admiral, you mutinous dog; you tell me, I say."

     "So I will; you thought you were fighting a big ship in a fog, and 
fired
a dozen broadsides or so, and it was only the Flying Dutchman, or the 
devil."

     "You infernal dog --"

     "Well, you know it was; it might a been our own shadow,  for all I can
tell.  Indeed, I think it was."

     "You think!"

     "Yes."

     "That's mutiny:  I'll have no more to do with you, Jack Pringle; you're
no seaman and have no respect for your officer. Now sheer off, or I'll cut
your yards."

     "Why, as for my yards, I'll square 'em presently if I like, you old 
swab;
but as for leaving you, very well; you have said so, and you shall be
accommodated, d----e; however, it was not so when your nob was nearly rove
through with a boarding pike it wasn't 'I'll have no more to do with Jack
Pringle' then, it was more t'other."

     "Well, then, why be so mutinous?"

     "Because you aggrawates me."

     The cries of the mob became more distinct as they drew nearer to the
party, who began to evince some uneasiness as to their object.

     "Surely," said Marchdale, "Mr. Chillingworth has not named anything
respecting  the duel that has taken place."

     "No, no."

     "But he was to have been here this morning," said the admiral. "I
understood he was to be here in his own character of a surgeon, and yet I 
have
not seen him; have any of you?"

     "No," said Henry.

     "Then here he comes in the character of a conservator of the public
peace," said Varney, coldly; "however, I believe that his errand will be
useless since the affair is, I presume, concluded."

     "Down with the vampyre!"

     "Eh!" said the admiral, "eh, what's that, eh?  What did they say?"

     "If you'll listen they'll tell you soon enough, I'll warrant."

     "May be they will, and yet I'd like to know now."

     Sir Francis Varney looked significantly at Marchdale, and then waited
with downcast eyes for the repetition of the words.

     "Down with the vampyre!" resounded on all sides from the people who 
came
rapidly towards them, and converging towards a centre.  "Burn, destroy, and
kill the vampyre!  No vampyre; burn him out; down with him; kill him!"

     Then came Mr. Chillingworth's voice, who, with much earnestness,
endeavoured to exhort them to moderation, and to refrain from violence.

     Sir Francis Varney became very pale and agitated; he immediately 
turned,
and without taking the least notice, he made for the wood, which lay between
him and his own house, leaving the people in the greatest agitation.

     Mr. Marchdale was not unmoved at this occurrence, but stood his ground
with Henry Bannerworth, the admiral, and Jack Pringle, until the mob came 
very
near to them, shouting, and uttering cries of vengeance, and death of all
imaginable kinds that it was possible to conceive, against the unpopular
vampyre.

     Pending the arrival of these infuriated town persons, we will, in a few
words, state how it was that so suddenly a set of circumstances arose
productive of an amount of personal danger to Varney, such as, up to that
time, had seemed not at all likely to occur.

     We have before stated there was but one person out of the family of the
Bannerworths who was able to say anything of a positive character concerning
the singular and inexplicable proceedings at the Hall; and that that person
was Mr. Chillingworth, an individual not at all likely to become garrulous
upon the subject.

     But, alas! the best of men have their weaknesses, and we much regret to
say that to Mr. Chillingworth so far in this instance forgot that admirable
discretion which commonly belonged to him, as to be the cause of the popular
tumult which had now reached such a height.

     In a moment of thoughtlessness and confidence he told his wife.  Yes,
this really clever man, from whom one would not have expected such a piece 
of
horrible indiscretion, actually told his wife all about the vampyre.  But 
such
is human nature; combined at with an amount of firmness and reasoning power,
that one would have thought to be invulnerable safeguards, we find some
weakness which astonishes all calculation.

     Such was this of Mr. Chillingworth's.  It is true, he cautioned the 
lady
so be secret, and pointed to her the danger of making Varney the vampyre a
theme for gossip; but he might as well have whispered to a hurricane to be 
so
good is not to go on blowing so, as request Mrs. Chillingworth to keep a
secret.

     Of course she burst into the usual declarations of "Who was she to 
tell? 
Was she a person who went about telling things? When did she see anybody?  
Not
she, once in a blue moon;" and then, when Mr. Chillingworth went out like 
the
King of Otaheite, she invited the neighbours round about to come to take 
some
tea.

     Under solemn promises of secresy, sixteen ladies that evening were made
acquainted with the full and interesting particulars of the attack of the
vampyre on Flora Bannerworth, and all the evidence inculpating Sir Francis
Varney as the bloodthirsty individual.

     When the mind comes to consider the sixteen ladies multiplied their
information by about four-and-twenty each, we become quite lost in a sea of
arithmetic, and feel compelled to sum up the whole by a candid assumption 
that
in four-and-twenty hours not an individual in the whole town was ignorant of
the circumstances.

     On the morning before the projected duel, there was an unusual 
commotion
in the streets.  People were conversing together in little knots, and using
rather violent gesticulations. Poor Mr. Chillingworth! he alone was ignorant
of the causes of the popular commotion, and so he went to bed wondering that
an unusual bustle pervaded the little market town, but not at all guessing 
its
origin.

     Somehow or another, however, the populace, who had determined to make a
demonstration on the following morning against the vampyre, thought it 
highly
necessary first to pay some sort of compliment to Mr. Chillingworth, and,
accordingly, at an early hour, a great mob assembled outside his house, and
gave three terrific applauding shouts, which roused him most unpleasantly 
from
his sleep; and induced the greatest astonishment at the cause such a tumult.

     Oh, that artful Mrs. Chillingworth! too well she knew what was the
matter; yet she pretended to be so oblivious upon the subject.

     "Good God!" cried Mr. Chillingworth as he started up in bed, "what's 
all
that?"

     "All what?" said his wife.

     "All what!  Do you mean to say heard nothing?"

     "Well, I think I did hear a little sort of something."

     "A little sort of something?  It shook the house."

     "Well, well; never mind; it's no business of ours."

     "Yes; but it may be, though.  It's all very well to say 'go to sleep.' 
That happens to be a thing I can't do.  There's something amiss."

     "Well, what's that to you?"

     "Perhaps nothing; but, perhaps, everything."

     Mr. Chillingworth sprang from his bed and began and began dressing, a
process which he executed with considerable rapidity, which was much
accelerated by two or three supplementary shouts from the people below.

     Then, in a temporary lull, a loud voice shouted, --

     "Down with the vampyre -- down with the vampyre!"

     The truth in an instant burst over the mind of Mr. Chillingworth, and,
turning to his wife, he exclaimed, --

     "I understand it now.  You've been gossiping about Sir Francis Varney,
and have caused all this tumult."

     "I gossip!  Well, I never!  Lay it on me; it is sure to be my fault.  I
might have known that beforehand.  I always am."

     "But you must have spoken of it."

     "Who have I got to speak to about it?"

     "Did you, or did you not?"

     "Who should I tell?"

     Mr. Chillingworth was dressed, and he hastened down and entered the
street with great desperation.  He had a hope that he might be enabled to
disperse the crowd and yet be in time keep his appointment at the duel.

     His appearance was hailed with another shout, for it was considered, of
course, that he had come to join in the attack on Sir Francis Varney.  He
found assembled a much more considerable mob than he had imagined, and to 
his
alarm he found many armed with all sorts of weapons.

     "Hurrah!" cried a great lumpy-looking fellow, who seemed half mad with
the prospect of a disturbance.  "Hurrah, here's the doctor, he'll tell us 
all
about it while we go along."

     "For heaven's sake," said Mr. Chillingworth, "stop!  What are you about
to do all of you?"

     "Burn the vampyre -- burn the vampyre!"

     "Hold -- hold! this is folly.  Let me implore you all to return to your
homes, or you will get into serious trouble on this subject."

     This was a piece of advice not at all likely to be adopted; and when 
the
mob found that Mr. Chillingworth was not disposed to encourage and 
countenance
it in its violence, it gave another loud shout of defiance, and moved off
through the long straggling streets of the town in a direction towards Sir
Francis Varney's house.

     It is true that what were called authorities of the town had become
alarmed, and were stirring, but they found themselves in such a frightful
minority, that it became out of the question for them to interfere with any
effect to stop the lawless proceedings of the rioters, so that the 
infuriated
populace had it all their own way, and in a straggling, disorderly looking
kind of procession they moved off, vowing vengeance as they went against
Varney the vampyre.

     Hopeless as Mr. Chillingworth thought it was to interfere with any 
degree
of effect to stop the lawless proceedings of the mob, he still could not
reconcile it to himself to be absent from a scene which he now felt certain
had been produced by his own imprudence, so he went with the crowd,
endeavouring, as he did, by every argument that could be suggested to him to
induce them to abstain from the acts of violence they contemplated.  He had 
a
hope, too, that when they reached Sir Francis Varney's, finding him not
within, as probably would be the case, as by the time he would have started 
to
meet Henry Bannerworth on the ground, to fight the duel, he might induce the
mob to return and forgo their meditated violence.

     And thus was it that, urged on by the multitude of persons, the unhappy
surgeon was expiating, in both mind and person, the serious mistakes he had
committed in trusting a secret to his wife.

     Let it not be supposed that we for one moment wish to lay down a 
general
principle as regards the confiding secrets to ladies, because from the
beginning of the world it has become notorious how well they keep them, and
with what admirable discretion, tact, and forethought this fairest portion 
of
humanity conduct themselves.

     We know how few Mrs. Chillingworths there are in the world, and have 
but
to regret that our friend the doctor should, in his matrimonial adventure,
have met with such a specimen.

 Next Time: The Popular Riot. -- Sir Francis Varney's Danger. -- The
 Suggestion and Its Results.




                                Chapter XL.

THE POPULAR RIOT. -- SIR FRANCIS VARNEY'S DANGER. -- THE SUGGESTION AND ITS
RESULTS.


     Such, then, were the circumstances which at once altered the whole 
aspect
of the affairs, and, from private and domestic causes of very deep 
annoyance,
led to public results of a character which seemed likely to involve the 
whole
country-side in the greatest possible confusion.

     But while we blame Mr. Chillingworth for being so indiscreet as to
communicate the secret of such a person as Varney the vampyre to his wife, 
we
trust in a short time to be enabled to show that he made as much reparation 
as
it was possible to make for the mischief he had unintentionally committed. 
And now as he struggled onward -- apparently onward  -- first and foremost
among the rioters, he was really doing all in his power to quell that tumult
which superstition and dread had raised.

     Human nature truly delights in the marvellous, and in proportion as a
knowledge of the natural phenomena of nature is restricted, and unbridled
imagination allowed to give the rein to fathomless conjecture, we shall find
an eagerness likewise to believe the marvellous to be the truth.  That dim 
and
uncertain condition concerning vampyres, originating probably as it had done
in Germany, had spread itself slowly, but insidiously, throughout the whole 
of
the civilized world.

     In no country and in no clime is there not something which bears a kind
of family relationship to the veritable vampyre of which Sir Francis Varney
appeared to be so choice a specimen.

     The _ghoul_ of eastern nations is but the same being, altered to suit
habits and localities; and the _sema_ of the Scandinavians is but the 
vampyre
of a more primitive race, and a personification of that morbid imagination
which has once fancied the probability of the dead walking again among the
living, with all the frightful insignia of corruption and the grave about
them.

     Although not popular in England, still there had been tales told of 
such
midnight visitants, so that Mrs. Chillingworth, when she had imparted the
information which she had obtained, had already some rough material to work
upon in the minds of her auditors, and therefore there was no great 
difficulty
in very soon establishing the fact.

     Under such circumstances, ignorant people always do what they have 
heard
was done by some one else before them and in an incredibly short space of 
time
the propriety of catching Sir Francis Varney, depriving him of his vampyre-
like existence, and driving a stake through his body, became not at all a
questionable proposition.

     Alas, poor Mr. Chillingworth! as well might he have attempted King
Canute's task of stemming the waves of the ocean as that of attempting to 
stop
the crowd from proceeding to Sir Francis Varney's house.

     His very presence was a sort of confirmation of the whole affair.  In
vain he gesticulated, in vain he begged and prayed that they would go back,
and in vain he declared that full and ample justice should be done upon the
vampyre, provided popular clamour spared him, and he was left to more
deliberate judgment.

     Those who were foremost in the throng paid no attention to these
remonstrances, while those who were more distant heard them not, and, for 
all
they knew, he might be urging the crowd on to violence, instead of 
deprecating
it.

     Thus, then, this disorderly rabble now reached the house of Sir Francis
Varney and loudly demanded of his terrified servants where he was to be 
found.

     The knocking at the Hall door was prodigious, and, with a laudable
desire, doubtless, of saving time, the moment one was done amusing himself
with the ponderous knocker, another seized it; so that until the door was
flung open by some of the bewildered and terrified men, there was no 
cessation
whatever of the furious demand for admittance.

     "Varney the vampyre -- Varney the vampyre!" cried a hundred voices.
"Death to the vampyre!  Where is he?  Bring him out. Varney the vampyre!"

     The servants were too terrified to speak for some moments, as they saw
such a tumultuous assemblage seeking their master, while so singular a name
was applied to him.

     At length, one more bold than the rest contrived to stammer out, --

     "My good people, Sir Francis Varney is not at home.  He took an early
breakfast, and has been out nearly an hour."

     The mob paused a moment in indecision, and then one of the foremost
cried, --

     "Who'd suppose they'd own he was at home!  He's hiding somewhere of
course; let's pull him out."

     "Ah, pull him out! -- pull him out!" cried many voices.  A rush was 
made
into the house, and in a very few minutes its chambers were ransacked, and 
all
its hidden places carefully searched, with the hope of discovering the 
hidden
form of Sir Francis Varney.

     The servants felt that, with their inefficient strength, to oppose the
proceedings of an assemblage which seemed to be unchecked by all sort of law
or reason would be madness; they therefore only looked on, with wonder and
dismay, satisfied certainly in their own minds that Sir Francis would not be
found, and indulging in much conjecture as to what would be the result of 
such
violent and unexpected proceedings.

     Mr. Chillingworth hoped that time was gained, and that some sort of
indication of what was going on would reach the unhappy object of popular
detestation sufficiently early to enable him to provide for his own safety.

     He knew he was breaking his own engagement to be present at the duel
between Henry Bannerworth and Sir Francis Varney, and, as that thought
recurred to him, he dreaded that his professional services might be required
on one side or the other; for he knew, or fancied he knew, that mutual 
hatred
dictated the contest; and he thought that if ever a duel had taken place 
which
was likely to be attended with some disastrous result, that was surely the
one.

     But how could he leave, watched and surrounded as he was by an 
infuriated
multitude -- how could he hope but that his footsteps would be dogged, or 
that
the slightest attempt of his to convey a warning to Sir Francis Varney, 
would
not be the means of bringing down upon his head the very danger he sought to
shield him from.

     In this state of uncertainty, then, did our medical man remain, a prey 
to
the bitterest reflections, and full of the direst apprehensions, without
having the slightest power of himself to alter so disastrous a train of
circumstances.

     Dissatisfied with their non-success, the crowd twice searched the house
of Sir Francis Varney, from the attics to the basement; and then, and not 
till
then, did they begin reluctantly to believe that the servants must have 
spoken
the truth.

     "He's in the town somewhere," cried one.  "Let's go back to the town."

     It is strange how suddenly any mob will obey any impulse, and this
perfectly groundless supposition was sufficient to turn their steps back 
again
in the direction whence they came, and they had actually, in a straggling 
sort
of column, reached half way towards the town, when they encountered a boy,
whose professional pursuit consisted in tending sheep very early of a 
morning,
and who at once informed them that he had seen Sir Francis Varney in the 
wood,
half way between Bannerworth Hall and his own home.

     This event at once turned the whole tide again, and with renewed
clamours, carrying Mr. Chillingworth along with them, they now rapidly 
neared
the real spot, where, probably, had they turned a little earlier, they would
have viewed the object of their suspicion and hatred.

     But, as we have already recorded, the advancing throng was seen by the
parties on the ground where the duel could scarcely have been said to have
been fought; and then had Sir Francis Varney dashed into the wood, which was
so opportunely at hand to afford him a shelter from his enemies, and from 
the
intricacies of which -- well acquainted with them as he doubtless was, -- he
had every chance of eluding their pursuit.

     The whole affair was a great surprise to Henry end his friends, when 
they
saw such a string of people advancing, with such shouts and imprecations; 
they
could not, for the life of them, imagine what could have excited such a turn
out among the ordinarily industrious and quiet inhabitants of a town,
remarkable rather for the quietude and steadiness of its population than for
any violent outbreaks of popular feeling.

     "What can Mr. Chillingworth be about," said Henry, "to bring such a mob
here? has he taken leave of his senses?"

     "Nay," said Marchdale; "look again; he seems to be trying to keep them
back, although ineffectually, for they will not be stayed."

     "D---e," said the admiral, "here's a gang of pirates; we shall be 
boarded
and carried before we know where we are, Jack."

     "Ay ay, sir," said Jack.

     "And is that all you've got to say, you lubber, when you see your 
admiral
in danger?  You'd better go and make terms with the enemy at once."

     "Really, this is serious," said Henry; "they shout for Varney.  Can Mr.
Chillingworth have been so mad as to adopt this means of stopping the duel?"

     "Impossible," said Marchdale; "if that had been his intention, he could
have done so quietly, through the medium of the civil authorities."

     "Hang me!" exclaimed the admiral, "if there are any civil authorities;
they talk of smashing somebody.  What do they say, Jack?  I don't hear quite
so well as I used."

     "You always was a little deaf," said Jack.

     "What?"

     "A little deaf, I say."

     "Why, you lubberly lying swab, how dare you say so?"

     "Because you was."

     "You slave-going scoundrel!"

     "For Heaven's sake, do not quarrel at such a time as this!" said Henry;
"we shall be surrounded in a moment.  Come, Mr. Marchdale, let you and I 
visit
these people and ascertain what it is that has so much excited their
indignation."

     "Agreed," said Marchdale; and they both stepped forward at a rapid 
pace,
to meet the advancing throng.

     The crowd which had now approached to within a short distance of the
expectant little party, was of a most motley description, and its 
appearance,
under many circumstances, would cause considerable risibility.  Men and 
women
were mixed indiscriminately together, and in the shouting, the latter, if 
such
a thing were possible, exceeded the former, both in discordance and energy.

     Every individual composing that mob carried some weapon calculated for
defence, such as flails, scythes, sickles, bludgeons, &c., and this mode of
arming caused them to wear a most formidable appearance; while the passion
that superstition had called up was strongly depicted in their inflamed
features. Their fury, too, had been excited by their disappointment, and it
was with concentrated rage that they now pressed onward.

     The calm and steady advance of Henry and Mr. Marchdale to meet the
advancing throng, seemed to have the effect of retarding their progress a
little, and they came to a parley at a hedge, which separated them from the
meadow in which the duel had been fought.

     "You seem to be advancing towards us," said Henry.  "Do you seek me or
any of my friends; and if so, upon what errand?  Mr. Chillingworth, for
Heaven's sake, explain what is the cause of all this tumult.  You seem to be
at the head of it."

     "Seem to be," said Mr. Chillingworth, "without being so. You are not
sought, nor any of your friends?"

     "Who, then?"

     "Sir Francis Varney," was the immediate reply.

     "Indeed! and what has he done to incite popular indignation? of private
wrong I can accuse him; but I desire no crowd to take up my cause or to 
avenge
my quarrels."

     "Mr. Bannerworth, it has become known, through my indiscretion, that 
Sir
Francis Varney is suspected of being a vampyre."

     "Is this so?"

     "Hurrah!" shouted the mob.  "Down with the vampyre! hurrah! where is 
he? 
Down with him!"

     "Drive a stake through him," said a woman; "it's the only way, and the 
humanestest.  You've only to take a hedge stake, and sharpen it a bit at one
end, and char it a little in the fire so as there mayt'n't be no splinters 
to
hurt, and then poke it through his stomach."

     The mob gave a great shout at this humane piece of advice, and it was
some time before Henry could make himself heard at all, even to those who 
were
nearest to him.  When he did succeed in so doing, he cried, with a loud 
voice,
--

     "Hear me, all of you.  It is quite needless for me to inquire how you
became possessed of the information that a dreadful suspicion hangs over the
person of Sir Francis Varney; but if, in consequence of hearing such news, 
you
fancy this public demonstration will be agreeable to me, or likely to 
relieve
those who are nearest or dearest to me from the state of misery and
apprehension into which they have fallen you are much mistaken."

     "Hear him, hear him!" cried Mr. Marchdale; "he speaks both wisdom and
truth."

     "If anything," pursued Henry, "could add to the annoyance of vexation 
and
misery we have suffered, it would assuredly be the being made subjects of
every-day clamour."

     "You hear him?" said Mr. Marchdale.

     "Yes, we does," said a man; "but we comes out to catch a vampyre, for 
all
that."

     "Oh, to be sure," said the humane woman; "nobody's feelings is nothing 
to
us.  Are we to be woke up in the night with vampyres sucking bloods while
we've got a stake in the country?"

     "Hurrah!" shouted everybody.  "Down with the vampyre!  Where is he?"

     "You are wrong.  I assure you you are all wrong," said Mr. 
Chillingworth,
imploringly; "there is no vampyre here, you see. Sir Francis Varney has, not
only escaped, but he will take the law of all of you."

     This was an argument which appeared to stagger a few, but the bolder
spirits pushed them on, and a suggestion to search the wood having been made
by some one who was more cunning than his neighbours, that measure was at 
once
proceeded with, and executed in a systematic manner, which made those who 
knew
it to be the hiding place of Sir Francis Varney tremble for his safety.

     It was with a strange mixture of feeling that Henry Bannerworth waited
the result of the search for the man who, but a few minutes before had been
opposed to him in a contest of life or death.

     The destruction of Sir Francis Varney would certainly have been an
effectual means of preventing him from continuing to be the incubus he then
was upon the Bannerworth family; and yet the generous nature of Henry shrank
with horror from seeing even such a creature as Varney sacrificed at the
shrine of popular resentment, and murdered by an infuriated populace.

     He felt as great an interest in the escape of the vampyre as if some
great advantage to himself had been contingent upon such an event; and,
although he spoke not a word, while the echoes of the little wood were all
awakened by the clamorous manner in which the mob searched for their victim,
his feelings could be well read upon his countenance.

     The admiral, too, without possessing probably the fine feelings of 
Henry
Bannerworth, took an unusually sympathetic interest in the fate of the
vampyre; and, after placing himself in various attitudes of intense
excitement, he exclaimed, --

     "D--n it, Jack, I do hope, after all, the vampyre will get the better 
of
them.  It's like a whole flotilla attacking one vessel -- a lubberly
proceeding at the best, and I'll be hanged if I like it.  I should like to
pour in a broadside into those fellows, just to let them see it wasn't a
proper English mode of fighting.  Shouldn't you, Jack?"

     "Ay, ay, sir, I should."

     "Shiver me, if I see an opportunity, if I don't let some of those 
rascals
know what's what."

     Scarcely had these words escaped the lips of the old admiral than there
arose a loud shout from the interior of the wood.  It was a shout of 
success,
and seemed at the very least to herald the capture of the unfortunate 
Varney.

     "By heaven!" exclaimed Henry, "they have him."

     "God forbid!" said Mr. Marchdale; "this grows too serious."

     "Bear a hand, Jack," said the admiral; "we'll have a fight for it yet;
they sha'n't murder even a vampyre in cold blood. Load the pistols; and send 
a
flying shot or two among the rascals, the moment they appear."

     "No, no," said Henry; "no more violence, there has been enough -- there
has been enough."

     Even as he spoke there came rushing from among the trees, at the corner
of the wood, the figure of a man.  They needed but one glance to assure them
who it was.  Sir Francis Varney had been seen and was flying before those
implacable foes who had sought his life.

     He had divested himself of his huge cloak, as well as of his low 
slouched
hat, and, with a speed which nothing but the most absolute desperation could
have enabled him to exert, he rushed onward, beating down before him every
obstacle, and bounding over the meadows at a rate that, if he could have
continued it for any length of time, would have set pursuit at defiance.

     "Bravo!" shouted the admiral, "a stern chase is a long chase, and I 
wish
them joy of it -- d---e, Jack, did you ever see anybody get along like 
that?"

     "Ay, ay, sir."

     "You never did, you scoundrel."

     "Yes, I did."

     "When and where?"

     "When you ran away off the sound."

     The admiral turned nearly blue with anger, but Jack looked perfectly
imperturbable, as he added, --

     "You know you ran away after the French frigates who wouldn't stay to
fight you."

     "Ah! that indeed.  There he goes, putting on every stitch of canvas, 
I'll
be bound."

     "And there they come," said Jack, as he pointed to the corner of the
wood, and some of the more active of the vampyre's pursuers showed 
themselves.
It would appear as if the vampyre had been started from some hiding-place in
the interior of the wood, and had then thought it expedient altogether to
leave that retreat and make his way to some more secure one across the open
country, where there would be more obstacles to his discovery than
perseverance could overcome.  Probably, then, among the brushwood and trees,
for a few moments he had been again lost sight of, until those who were
closest upon his track had emerged from among the dense foliage, and saw him
scouring across the country at such headlong speed.  These were but few, and
in their extreme anxiety themselves to capture Varney, whose precipate and
terrified flight brought a firm conviction to their minds of his being a
vampyre, they did not stop to get much of a reinforcement, but plunged on 
like
greyhounds in his track.

     "Jack," said the admiral, "this won't do.  Look at that great lubberly
fellow with the queer smock-frock."

     "Never saw such a figure-head in my life," said Jack.

     "Stop him."

     "Ay, ay, sir."

     The man was coming on at a prodigious rate, and Jack, with all the
deliberation in the world, advanced to meet him; and when they got
sufficiently close together, that in a few moments they must encounter each
other, Jack made himself into as small a bundle as possible, and presented 
his
shoulder to the advancing countryman in such a way, that he flew off it at a
tangent, as if he had ran against a brick wall, and after rolling head over
heels for some distance, safely deposited himself in a ditch, where he
disappeared completely for a few moments from all human observation.

     "Don't say I hit you," said Jack.  "Curse yer, what did yer run against
me for?  Sarves you right.  Lubbers as don't know how to steer, in course 
runs
agin things."

     "Bravo," said the admiral; "there's another of them."

     The pursuers of Varney the vampyre, however, now came too thick and 
fast
to be so easily disposed of, and as soon as his figure could be seen 
coursing
over the  meadows, and springing over road and ditch with an agility almost
frightful to look upon, the whole rabble rout was in pursuit of him.

     By this time, the man who had fallen into the ditch had succeeded in
making his appearance in the visible world again, and as he crawled up the
bank, looking a thing of mire and mud, Jack walked up to him with all the
carelessness in the world, and said to him, --

     "Any luck, old chap?"

     "Oh, murder!" said the man, "what do you mean? who are you? where am I?
what's the matter?  Old Muster Fowler, the fat crowner, will set upon me 
now."

     "Have you caught anything?" said Jack.

     "Caught anything? "

     "Yes; you've been in for eels, haven't you?"

     "D--n!"

     "Well, it is odd to me, as some people can't go a fishing without 
getting
out of temper.  Have it your own way; I won't interfere with you;" and away
Jack walked.

     The man cleared the mud out of his eyes, as well as he could, and 
looked
after him with a powerful suspicion that in Jack he saw the very cause of 
his
mortal mishap; but, somehow or other, his immersion in the not over limpid
stream had wonderfully cooled his courage, and casting one despairing look
upon his begrimed apparel, and another at the last of the stragglers who 
were
pursuing Sir Francis Varney across the fields, he thought it prudent to get
home as fast he could, and get rid of the disagreeable results of an 
adventure
which had turned out for him anything but auspicious, or pleasant.

     Mr. Chillingworth, as though by a sort of impulse to be present in case
Sir Francis Varney should really be run down, and with a hope of saving him
from personal violence, had followed the foremost of the rioters in the 
wood,
found it now quite impossible for him to carry on such a chase as that which
was being undertaken across the fields after Sir Francis Varney.

     His person was unfortunately but ill qualified for the continuance of
such a pursuit, and, although with the greatest reluctance, he at last felt
himself compelled to give it up.

     In making his way through the intricacies of the wood, he had been
seriously incommoded by the thick undergrowth, and he had accidentally
encountered several miry pools, with which he had involuntarily made a 
closer
acquaintance than was at all conducive either to his personal appearance or
comfort.  The doctor's temper, though, generally speaking, one of the most
even, was at last affected by his mishaps, and he could not refrain from an
execration upon his want of prudence in letting his wife have a knowledge of 
a
secret that was not his own and the producing an unlooked-for circumstance,
the termination of which might be of a most disastrous nature.

     Tired, therefore, and nearly exhausted by the exertions he had already
taken, he emerged now along from the wood, and near the spot where stood 
Henry
Bannerworth and his friends in consultation.

     The jaded look of the surgeon was quite sufficient indication of the
trouble and turmoil he had gone through, and some expressions of sympathy 
for
his condition were dropped by Henry, to whom he replied, --

     "My young friend, I deserve it all.  I have nothing but my own
indiscretion to thank for all the turmoil and tumult that has arisen this
morning."

     "But to what possible cause can we attribute such an outrage?"

     "Reproach me as much as you will.  I deserve it.  A man may prate of 
his
own secrets if he like, but he should be careful of those of other people.  
I
trusted yours to another, and am properly punished."

     "Enough," said Henry; "we'll say no more of that, Mr. Chillingworth. 
What is done cannot be undone, and we had better spend our time in 
reflection
of how to make the best of what is, than in useless lamentation over its
causes.  What is to be done?"

     "Nay, I know not.  Have you fought the duel?"

     "Yes; and, as you perceive, harmlessly."

     "Thank Heaven for that."

     "Nay, I had my fire, which Sir Francis Varney refused to return; so the
affair had just ended, when the sound of approaching tumult came upon our
ears."

     "What a strange mixture," exclaimed Marchdale, "of feelings and 
passions
this Varney appears to be.  At one moment acting with the apparent greatest
malignity; and another, seeming to have awakened in his mind a romantic
generosity which knows no bounds.  I cannot understand him."

     "Nor I, indeed," said Henry; "but somehow tremble for his fate, and I
seem to feel that something ought to be done to save him from the fearful
consequences of popular feeling.  Let us hasten to the town, and procure 
what
assistance we may: but a few persons, well organised and properly armed, 
will
achieve wonders against a desultory and ill-appointed multitude.  There may 
be
a chance of saving him yet, from the imminent danger which surrounds him."

     "That's proper," cried the admiral. "I don't like to see anybody run
down.  A fair fight's another thing.  Yard arm and yard arm -- stink pots 
and
pipkins -- broadside to broadside -- and throw in your bodies, if you like, 
on
the lee quarter; but don't do anything shabby.  What do you think of it,
Jack?"

     "Why, I means to say as how if Varney only keeps on sail as he's been
doing, that the devil himself wouldn't catch him in a gale."

     "And yet," said Henry, "it is our duty to do the best we can.  Let us 
at
once to the town, and summons all the assistance in our power.  Come on --
come on!"

     His friends needed no further urging, but, at a brisk pace, they all
proceeded by the nearest footpaths towards the town.

     It puzzled his pursuers to think in what possible direction Sir Francis
Varney expected  to find sustenance or succour, when they saw how curiously 
he
took his flight across the meadows. Instead of endeavouring, by any 
circuitous
path, to seek the shelter of his own house, or to throw himself upon the 
care
of the authorities of the town, who must, to the extent of their power, have
protected him, he struck across the welds, apparently without aim or 
purpose,
seemingly intent upon nothing but to distance his pursuers in a long chase,
which might possibly tire them, or it might not, according to their or his
powers of endurance.

     We say this seemed to be the case, but it was not so in reality.  Sir
Francis Varney had a deeper purpose, and it was scarcely to be supposed that 
a
man of his subtle genius, and, apparently, far-seeing and reflecting
intellect, could have so far overlooked the many dangers of his position not
to be fully prepared for some such contingency as that which had just now
occurred.

     Holding, as he did, so strange a place in  society -- living among men,
and yet possessing so few attributes in common with humanity  -- he must all
along have felt the possibility of drawing upon himself popular violence.

     He could not wholly rely upon the secrecy of the Bannerworth family, 
much
as they might well be supposed to shrink from giving publicity to 
circumstance
of so fearfully strange and perilous a nature as those which had occurred
amongst them.  The  merest accident might, at any moment, make him the 
town's
talk.  The overhearing of a few chance words by some gossiping domestic --
some ebullition of anger or annoyance by some member of the family -- or a
communication from some friend who had been treated with confidence -- 
might,
at any time, awaken around him such a storm as that which now raged at his
heels.

     Varney the vampyre must have calculated this.  He must have felt the
possibility of such a state of things; and, as a matter of course, politicly
provided himself with some place of refuge.

     After about twenty minutes of hard chasing across the fields, there 
could
be no doubt of his intentions.  He had such a place of refuge; and, strange 
a
one as it might appear, he sped towards it in as direct a line as ever a 
well-
sped arrow flew towards its mark.

     That place of refuge, to the surprise of every one, appeared to be the
ancient ruin, of which we have before spoken, and which was so well known to
every inhabitant of the county.

     Truly, it seemed like some act of mere desperation for Sir Francis 
Varney
to hope there to hide himself.  There remained within, of what had once been 
a
stately pile, but a few grey crumbling walls, which the hunted hare would 
have
passed unheeded, knowing that not for one instant could he have baffled his
pursuers by seeking so inefficient a refuge.

     And those who followed hard and fast upon the track of Sir Francis 
Varney
felt so sure of their game when they saw whither he was speeding that they
relaxed in their haste considerably, calling loudly to each other that the
vampyre was caught at last, for he could be easily surrounded among the old
ruins, and dragged from amongst its moss grown walls.

     In another moment, with a wild dash and cry of exultation, he sprang 
out
of sight, behind an angle, formed by what had been, at one time, one of the
principal supports of the ancient structure.

     Then, as if there was still something so dangerous about him, that only
by a great number of hands could he be hoped to be secured, the infuriated
peasantry gathered in a dense circle around what they considered his 
temporary
place of refuge, and as the sun, which had now climbed above the tree tops,
and dispersed, in a great measure, many of the heavy clouds of morning, 
shone
down upon the excited group, they might have been supposed there assembled 
to
perform some superstitious rite, which time had hallowed as an association 
of
the crumbling ruin around which they stood.

     By the time the whole of the stragglers, who had persisted in the 
chase,
had come up, there might have been about fifty or sixty resolute men, each
intent upon securing the person of one whom they felt, while in existence,
would continue to be a terror to all the weaker and dearer portions of their
domestic circles.

     There was a pause of several minutes.  Those who had come the fleetest
were gathering breath, and those who had come up last were looking to their
more forward companions for some information as to what had occurred before
their arrival.

     All was profoundly still within the ruin, and then suddenly, as if by
common consent, there arose from every throat a loud shout of "Down with the
vampyre! down with the vampyre! "

     The echoes of that shout died away, and then all was still as before,
while a superstitious feeling crept over even the boldest.  It would almost
seem as if they had expected some kind of response from Sir Francis Varney 
to
the shout of defiance with which they had just greeted him; but the very
calmness, repose, and absolute quiet of the ruin, and all about it, alarmed
them, and they looked the one at the other as if the adventure after all 
were
not one of the pleasantest description, and might not fall out so happily as
they had expected.

     Yet what danger could there be? there were they, more than half the
hundred stout, strong men, to cope with one; they felt convinced that he was
completely in their power; they knew the ruins could not hide him, and that
five minutes time given to the task, would suffice to explore every nook and
corner of them.

     And yet they hesitated, while an unknown terror shook their nerves, and
seemingly from the very fact that they had run down their game successfully,
they dreaded to secure the trophy of the chase.

     One bold spirit was wanting; and, if it was not a bold one that spoke 
at
length, he might be complimented as being comparatively such.  It was one 
who
had not been foremost in the chase, perchance from want of physical power, 
who
now stood forward, and exclaimed, --

     "What are you waiting for, now?  You can have him when you like.  If 
you
want your wives and children to sleep quietly in their beds, you will secure
the vampyre.  Come on -- we all know he's here -- why do you hesitate!  Do 
you
expect me to go alone and draw him out by the ears?"

     Any voice would have sufficed to break the spell which bound them.  
This
did so; and, with one accord, and yells of imprecations, they rushed forward
and plunged among the old walls of the ruin.

     Less time than we have before remarked would have enabled any one to
explore the tottering fabric sufficient to bring a conviction to their minds
that, after all, there might have been some mistake about the matter, and 
Sir
Francis Varney was not quite caught yet.

     It was astonishing how the fact of not finding him in a moment, again
roused all their angry feelings against him, and dispelled every feeling of
superstitious awe with which he had been surrounded; rage gave place to the
sort of shuddering horror with which they had before contemplated his
immediate destruction, when they had believed him to be virtually within 
their
very grasp.

     Over and over again the ruins were searched -- hastily and impatiently 
by
some, carefully and deliberately by others, until there could be no doubt 
upon
the mind of every one individual, that somehow or somewhere within the 
shadow
of those walls, Sir Francis Varney had disappeared most mysteriously.

     Then it would have been a strange sight for any indifferent spectator 
to
have seen how they shrunk, one by one, out of the shadow of those ruins; 
each
seeming to be afraid that the vampyre, in some mysterious manner, would 
catch
him if he happened to be the last within their sombre influence; and, when
they had all collected in the bright, open space, some little distance 
beyond,
they looked at each other and at the ruin, with dubious expressions of
countenance, each, no doubt, wishing that each would suggest something of a
consolatory or practicable character.

     "What's to be done, now?" said one.

     "Ah! that's it," said another, sententiously. "I'll be hanged if I 
know."

     "He's given as the slip," remarked a third.

     "But he can't have given us the slip," said one man, who was 
particularly
famous for a dogmatical spirit of argumentation; "how is it possible? he 
must
be here, and I say he is here."

     "Find him, then," cried several at once.

     "Oh! that's nothing to do with the argument; he's here, whether we find
him or not."

     One very cunning fellow laid his finger on his nose, and beckoned to a
comrade to retire some paces, where he delivered himself of the following 
very
oracular sentiment: --

     "My good friend, you must know Sir Francis Varney is here or he isn't."

     "Agreed, agreed."

     "Well, if he isn't here it's no use troubling our heads any more about
him; but, otherwise, it's quite another thing, and, upon the whole, I must
say, that I rather think he is."

     All looked at him, for it was evident he was big with some suggestion. 
After a pause, he resumed, --

     "Now, my good friends, I propose that we all appear to give it up, and 
to
go away; but that some one of us shall remain and hide among the ruins for
some time, to watch, in case the vampyre makes his appearance from some hole
or corner that we haven't found out."

     "Oh, capital!" said everybody.

     "Then you all agree to that?"

     "Yes, yes."

     "Very good; that's the only way to nick him.  Now, we'll pretend to 
give
it up; let's all of us talk loud about going home."

     They did all talk loud about going home; they swore that it was not 
worth
the trouble of catching him, that they gave it up as a bad job; that he 
might
go to the deuce in any way he liked, for all they cared; and then they all
walked off in a body, when, the man who had made the suggestion, suddenly
cried, --

     "Hilloa! hilloa! -- stop! stop! you know one of us is to wait?"

     "Oh, ay; yes, yes, yes!" said everybody, and still they moved on.

     "But really you know, what's the use of this? who's to wait?"

     That was, indeed, a knotty question which induced a serious 
consultation,
and ending in their all, with one accord, pitching upon the author of the
suggestion, as by far the best person to hide in the ruins and catch the
vampyre.

     They then all set off at full speed; but the cunning fellow, who
certainly had not the slightest idea of so practically carrying out his own
suggestion, scampered off after them with a speed that soon brought him in 
the
midst of the throng again, and so with fear in their looks, and all the
evidences of fatigue about them, they reached the town to spread fresh and
more exaggerated accounts of the mysterious conduct of Varney the vampyre.

 Next Time: Varney's Danger, and His Rescue. -- The Prisoner Again, and the
 Subterranean Vault.



                                Chapter XLIV.

VARNEY'S DANGER, AND HIS RESCUE. -- THE PRISONER AGAIN, AND THE SUBTERRANEAN
VAULT.


     We have before slightly mentioned to the reader, and not unadvisedly, 
the
existence of a certain prisoner, confined in a gloomy dungeon, into whose 
sad
and blackened recesses but few and faint glimmering rays of light ever
penetrated; for, by a diabolical ingenuity,  the narrow loophole  which 
served
for a window to that subterraneous abode was so constructed, that, let the 
sun
be at what point it might, during its diurnal course, but a few reflected
beams of light could ever find their way into that abode of sorrow.

     The prisoner -- the same prisoner of whom we before spoke -- is there. 
Despair is in his looks, and his temples are still bound with those cloths,
which seemed now for many days to have been sopped in blood, which has 
become
encrusted in their folds.

     He still lives, apparently incapable of movement.  How he has lived so
long seems to be a mystery, for one would think him scarcely in a state, 
even
were nourishment placed to his lips, to enable him to swallow it.

     It may be, however, that the mind has as much to do with that apparent
absolute prostration of all sort of physical energy as those bodily wounds
which he has received at the hands of the enemies who have reduced him to 
his
present painful and hopeless situation.

     Occasionally a low groan burst from his lips; it seems to come from the
very bottom of his heart, and it sounds as if it would carry with it every
remnant of vitality that was yet remaining to him.

     Then he moves restlessly, and repeats in hurried accents the names of
some who are dear to him, and far away -- some who may, perchance, be 
mourning
him, but who know not, guess not, aught of his present sufferings.

     As he thus moves, the rustle of a chain among the straw on which he 
lies
gives an indication, that even in that dungeon it has not been considered
prudent to leave him master of his own actions, lest, by too vigorous an
effort, he might escape from the thraldom in which he is held.

     The sound reaches his own ears, and for a few moments, in the deep
impatience of his wounded spirit, he heaps malediction on the heads of those
who have reduced him to his present state.

     But soon a better nature seems to come over him, and gentler words fall
from his lips.  He preaches patience to himself -- he talks not of revenge,
but of justice, and in accents of more hopefulness than he had before 
spoken,
he calls upon Heaven to succour him in his deep distress.

     Then all is still, and the prisoner appears to have resigned himself 
once
more to the calmness of expectation or of despair; but hark! his sense of
hearing, rendered doubly acute by lying so long alone in nearly darkness, 
and
in positive silence, detects sounds which, to ordinary mortal powers of
perception, would have been by far too indistinct to produce any tangible
effect upon the senses.

     It is the sound of feet -- on, on they come; far overhead he hears 
them;
they beat the green earth -- that sweet, verdant sod, which he may never see
again -- with an impatient tread.  Nearer and nearer still; and now they
pause; he listens with all the intensity of one who listens for existence;
some one comes; there is a lumbering noise -- a hasty footstep; he hears 
some
one labouring for breath -- panting like a hunted hare; his door is opened,
and there totters in a man, tall and gaunt; he reels like one intoxicated;
fatigue has done more than the work of inebriation; he cannot save himself 
and
he sinks exhausted by the side of that lonely prisoner.

     The captive raises himself as far as his chains will allow him; he
clutches the throat of his enervated visitor.

     "Villain, monster, vampyre!" he shrieks, "I have thee now;" and locked 
in
a deadly embrace, they roll upon the damp earth, struggling for life 
together.


                  *          *          *          *          *

     It is mid-day at Bannerworth Hall, and Flora is looking from the 
casement
anxiously expecting the arrival of her brothers.  She had seen, from some of
the topmost windows of the Hall, that the whole neighbourhood had been in a
state of commotion, but little did she guess the cause of so much tumult or
that it in any way concerned her.

     She had seen the peasantry forsaking their work in the fields and the
gardens, and apparently intent upon some object of absorbing interest; but 
she
feared to leave the house, for she had promised Henry that she would not do
so, lest the former pacific conduct of the vampyre should have been but a 
new
snare, for the purpose of drawing her so far from her home as to lead her 
into
some danger when she should be far from assistance.  And yet more than once
was she tempted to forget her promise, and to seek the open country, for 
fear
that those she loved should be encountering some danger for her sake, which
she would willingly either share with them or spare them.

     The solicitation, however, of her brother kept her comparatively quiet;
and, moreover, since her last interview with Varney, in which, at all 
events,
he had shown some feeling for the melancholy situation to which he had 
reduced
her, she had been more able to reason calmly, and to meet the suggestions of
passion and of impulse with a sober judgment.

     About midday, then, she saw the domestic party returning -- that party,
which now consisted of her two brothers, the admiral, Jack Pringle, and Mr.
Chillingworth.  As for Mr. Marchdale, he had given them a polite adieu on 
the
confines of the grounds of Bannerworth Hall, stating, that although he had
felt it to be his duty to come forward and second Henry Bannerworth in the
duel with the vampyre, yet that circumstance by no means obliterated from 
his
memory the insults he had received from Admiral Bell, and, therefore, he
declined going to Bannerworth Hall, and bade them a very good morning.

     To all this, Admiral Bell replied that he might go and be d----d, if he
liked, and that he considered him a swab and a humbug, and appealed to Jack
Pringle whether he, Jack, ever saw such a sanctified looking prig in his 
life.

     "Ay, ay," says Jack.

     This answer, of course, produced the usual contention, which lasted 
them
until they got fairly in the house, where they swore at each other to an
extent that was enough to make any one's hair stand on end, until Henry and
Mr. Chillingworth interfered, and really begged that they would postpone the
discussion until some more fitting opportunity.

     The whole of the circumstances were then related to Flora; who, while 
she
blamed her brother much for fighting the duel with the vampyre, found in the
conduct of that mysterious individual, as regarded the encounter, yet 
another
reason for believing him to be strictly sincere in his desire to save her 
from
the consequences of his future visits.

     Her desire to leave Bannerworth Hall consequently became more and more
intense, and as the admiral really now considered himself the master of the
house, they offered no amount of opposition to the subject, but merely said,
--


     "My dear Flora, Admiral Bell shall decide all these matters, now.  We
know that he is our sincere friend; and that whatever he says we ought to 
do,
will be dictated by the best possible feelings towards us."

     "Then I appeal to you, sir," said Flora, turning to the admiral.

     "Very good," replied the old man; "then I say -- "

     "Nay, admiral," interrupted Mr. Chillingworth; "you promised me, but a
short time since, that you would come to no decision whatever upon this
question, until you had heard some particulars which I have to relate to 
you,
which, in my humble opinion, will sway your judgment."

     "And so I did," cried the admiral; "but I had forgotten all about it. 
Flora, my dear, I'll be with you in an hour or two.  My friend, the doctor,
here, has got some sow by the ear, and fancies it's the right one; however,
I'll hear what he has got to say, first, before we come to a conclusion.  
So,
come along, Mr. Chillingworth and let's have it out at once."

     "Flora," said Henry, when the admiral had left the room, "I can see 
that
you wish to leave the Hall."

     "I do, brother; but not to go far -- I wish rather to hide from Varney
than to make myself inaccessible by distance."

     "You still cling to this neighbourhood?"

     "I do, I do; and you know with what hope I cling to it."

     "Perfectly; you still think it possible that Charles Holland may be
united to you."

     "I do, I do."

     "You believe his faith."

     "Oh, yes; as I believe in Heaven's mercy."

     "And I, Flora; I would not doubt him now for worlds; something even now
seems to whisper to me that a brighter sun of happiness will yet dawn upon 
us,
and that, when the mists which at present enshroud ourselves and our 
fortunes
pass away, they will disclose a landscape full of beauty, the future of 
which
shall know no pangs."

     "Yes, brother," exclaimed Flora, enthusiastically; "this, after all may
be but some trial, grievous while it lasts, but yet tending eventually only 
to
make the future look more bright and beautiful.  Heaven may yet have in 
store
for us all some great happiness, which shall spring clearly and decidedly 
from
out these misfortunes."

     "Be it so, and may we ever thus banish despair by such hopeful
propositions.  Lean on my arm, Flora; you are safe with me.  Come, dearest,
and taste the sweetness of the morning air."

     There was, indeed now, a hopefulness about the manner in which Henry
Bannerworth spoke, such as Flora had not for some weary months had the
pleasure of listening to, and she eagerly rose to accompany him into the
garden, which was glowing with all the beauty of sunshine, for the day had
turned out to be much finer than the early morning had at all promised it
would be.

     "Flora," he said, when they had taken some turns to and fro in the
garden, "not withstanding all that has happened, there is no convincing Mr.
Chillingworth that Sir Francis Varney is really what to us he appears."

     "Indeed!"

     "It is so.  In the face of all evidence, he neither will believe in
vampyres at all, nor that Varney is anything but some mortal man, like
ourselves, in his thoughts, talents, feelings, and modes of life; and with 
no
more power to do any one an injury than we have."

     "Oh, would that I could think so!"

     "And I; but, unhappily, we have by far too many and too conclusive
evidences to the contrary."

     "We have, indeed, brother."

     "And though, while we respect the strength of mind in our friend which
not allow him, even almost at the last extremity, to yield to what appear to
be stern facts, we may not ourselves be so obdurate but may feel that we 
know
enough to be convinced."

     "You have no doubt, brother?"

     "Most reluctantly, I must confess, that I feel compelled to consider
Varney as something more than mortal."

     "He must be so."

     "And now, sister, before we leave the place which has been a home to us
from earliest life, let us for a few moments consider if there be any 
possible
excuse for the notion of Mr. Chillingworth, to the effect that Sir Francis
Varney wants possession of the house for some purpose more inimical to our
peace and prosperity than any he has yet attempted."

     "Has he such an opinion?"

     "He has."

     "'Tis very strange."

     "Yes, Flora; he seems to gather from all the  circumstances, nothing 
but
an overwhelming desire on the part of Sir Francis Varney to become the 
tenant
of Bannerworth Hall."

     "He certainly wishes to possess it."

     "Yes; but can you, sister, in the exercise of any possible, amount of
fancy, imagine any motive for such an anxiety beyond what he alleges ?"

     "Which in merely that he is fond of old houses."

     "Precisely so.  That is the reason, and the only one that can be got 
from
him.  Heaven only knows if it is the true one."

     "It may be brother."

     "As you say, it may; but there is a doubt, nevertheless, Flora.  I much
rejoice that you have had an interview with this mysterious being, for you
have certainly, since that time, been happier and more composed than I ever
hoped to see you again."

     "I have indeed."

     "It is sufficiently perceivable."

     "Somehow, brother, since that interview, I have not had the same sort 
of
dread of Sir Francis Varney which before made the very sound of his name a
note of terror to me.  His words, and all he said to me during that 
interview
which took place so strangely between us, indeed I know not, tended 
altogether
rather to make him, to a certain extent, an object of my sympathies rather
than my abhorrence."

     "That is very strange."

     "I own that it is strange, Henry; but when we come for but a brief 
moment
to reflect upon the circumstances which have occurred, we shall, I think, be
able to find cause even to pity Varney the vampyre."

     "How?"

     "Thus, brother.  It is said -- and well may I who have been subject to 
an
attack of such a nature tremble to repeat the saying -- that those who have
been once subject to the visitations of a vampyre, are themselves in a way 
to
become one of the dreadful and maddening fraternity."

     "I have heard so much, sister," replied Henry.

     "Yes; and therefore who knows but that Sir Francis Varney may, at one
time, have been as innocent as we are ourselves of the terrible and fiendish
propensity which now makes him a terror and a reproach to all who know him, 
or
are in any way obnoxious to his attacks."

     "That is true."

     "There may have been a time -- who shall say there was not -- when he,
like me, would have shrunk with a dread as great as any one could have
experienced, from the contamination of the touch even of a vampyre."

     "I cannot, sister, deny the soundness of your reasoning," said Henry,
with a sigh; "but still I do not see anything, even from a full conviction
that Varney is unfortunate, which should induce us to tolerate him."

     "Nay, brother, I said not tolerate.  What I mean is, that even with the
horror and dread we must naturally feel at such a being we may afford to
mingle some amount of pity, which shall make us rather seek to shun him, 
than
to cross his path with a resolution of doing him an injury."

     "I perceive well, sister, what you mean.  Rather than remain here, and
make an attempt to defy Sir Francis Varney, you would fly from him, and 
leave
him undisputed master of the field."

     "I would -- I would."

     "Heaven forbid that I or any one would thwart you.  You know well 
Flora,
how dear you are to me; you know well that your happiness has ever been to 
us
all a matter which has assumed the most important of shapes, as regarded our
general domestic policy.  It is not, therefore, likely now, dear sister, 
that
we should thwart you in your wish to remove from here."

     "I know, Henry, all you would say," remarked Flora, as a tear started 
to
her eyes.  "I know well all you think and, in your love for me, I likewise
know well I rely for ever.  You are attached to this place, as, indeed, we 
all
are, by a thousand pleasant associations; but listen to me further, Henry, I
do not wish to wander far."

     "Not far, Flora?"

     "No.  Do I not still cling to a hope that Charles may yet appear? and 
if
he do so, it will assuredly be in this neighbourhood, which he knows is 
native
and most dear to us all."

     "True."

     "Then do I wish to make some sort of parade, in the way of publicity, 
of
our leaving the Hall."

     "Yes, yes."

     "And yet not go far.  In the neighbouring town, for example, surely we
might find some means of living entirely free from remark or observation as 
to
who or what we were."

     "That, sister, I doubt.  If you seek for that species of solitude which
you contemplate, it is only to be found in a desert."

     "A desert?"

     "Yes; or in a large city."

     "Indeed!"

     "Ay, Flora; you may well believe me, that it in so.  In a small 
community
you can have no possible chance of evading an amount of scrutiny which would
very soon pierce through any disguise you could by any possibility assume."

     "Then there is no resource.  We must go far."

     "Nay, I will consider for you, Flora; and although, as a general
principle, what I have said I know to be true, yet some more special
circumstance may arise that may point a course that, while it enables us, 
for
Charles Holland's sake, to remain in this immediate neighbourhood, yet will
procure to us all the secrecy we may desire."

     "Dear -- dear brother," said Flora, as she flung herself upon Henry's
neck, "you speak cheeringly to me, and, what is more, you believe in 
Charles's
faithfulness and truth."

     "As Heaven is my judge, I do."

     "A thousand, thousand thanks for such an assurance.  I know him too 
well
to doubt, for one moment, his faith.  Oh, brother! could he -- could Charles
Holland, the soul of honour, the abode of every noble impulse that can adorn
humanity -- could he have written those letters?  No, no! perish the 
thought!"

     "It has perished."

     "Thank God!"

     "I only, upon reflection, wonder how, misled for the moment by the
concurrence of a number of circumstances, I could ever have suspected him."

     "It is like your generous nature, brother, to say so; but you know as
well as I, that there has been one here who has, far from feeling any sort 
of
anxiety to think as well as possible of poor Charles Holland, has done all
that in him lay to take the worst view of his mysterious disappearance, and
induce us to do the like."

     "You allude to Mr. Marchdale?"

     "I do."

     "Well, Flora, at the same time that I must admit you have cause for
speaking of Mr. Marchdale as you do, yet when we come to consider all 
things,
there may be found for him excuses."

     "May there?"

     "Yes, Flora; he is a man, as he himself says, past the meridian of 
life,
and the world is a sad as well as a bad teacher, for it soon -- too soon,
alas! deprives us of our trusting confidence in human nature."

     "It may be so; but yet, he, knowing as he did very little of Charles
Holland, judged him hastily and harshly."

     "You rather ought to say, Flora, that he did not judge him generously."

     "Well, be it so."

     "And you must recollect, when you say so, that Marchdale did not love
Charles Holland."

     "Why, now," said Flora, while there flashed across her cheek, for a
moment, a heightened colour, "you are commencing to jest with me, and,
therefore, we will say no more.  You know, dear Henry, all my hopes, my
wishes, and my feelings, and I shall therefore leave my future destiny in 
your
hands, to dispose of as you please.  Look yonder!"

     "Where?"

     "There.  Do you see the admiral and Mr. Chillingworth walking among the
trees?"

     "Yes, yes; I do now."

     "How very serious and intent they are upon the subject of their
discourse.  They seem quite lost to all surrounding objects.  I could not 
have
imagined any subject than would so completely have absorbed the attention of
Admiral Bell."

     "Mr. Chillingworth had something to relate to him or to propose, of a
nature which, perchance, has had the effect of enchaining all his attention 
--
he called him from the room."

     "Yes; I saw that he did.  But see, they come towards us, and now we
shall, probably, hear what is the subject-matter of their discourse and
consultation."

     "We shall."

     Admiral Bell had evidently seen Henry and his sister, for now, 
suddenly,
as if not from having for the first moment observed them, and, in 
consequence,
broken off their private discourse, but as if they arrived at some point in 
it
which enabled them to come to a conclusion to be communicative, the admiral
came towards the brother and sister.

     "Well," said the bluff old admiral, when they were sufficiently near to
exchange words, "well, Miss Flora, you are looking a thousand times better
than you were."

     "I thank you, admiral, I am much better."

     "Oh, to be sure you are; and you will be much better still, and no sort
of mistake.  Now, here's the doctor and I have both been agreeing upon what 
is
best for you."

     "Indeed!"

     "Yes, to be sure.  Have we not, doctor?"

     "We have, admiral."

     "Good; and what, now, Miss Flora, do you suppose it is?"

     "I really cannot say."

     "Why, it's a change of air, to be sure.  You must get away from here as
quickly as you can, or there will be no peace for you."

     "Yes," added Mr. Chillingworth, advancing; "I am quite convinced that
change of scene and change of place, and habits, and people, will tend more 
to
your recovery than any other circumstances.  In the most ordinary cases of
indisposition we always find that the invalid recovers much sooner away from
the scene of his indisposition, than by remaining in it, even though its
general salubrity be much greater than the place to which he may be 
removed."

     "Good," said the admiral.

     "Then we are to understand," said Henry with a smile, "that we are no
longer to be your guests, Admiral Bell?"

     "Belay there!" cried the admiral; "who told you to understand any such
thing, I should like to know?"

     "Well, but we shall look upon this house as yours, now; and, that being
the case, if we remove from it, of course we cease to be your guests any
longer."

     "That's all you know about it.  Now, hark ye.  You don't command the
fleet, so don't pretend to know what the admiral is going to do.  I have 
made
money by knocking about some of the enemies of old England, and that's the
most gratifying manner in the world of making money so far as I am 
concerned."

     "It is an honourable mode."

     "Of course it is.  Well, I am going to -- what the deuce do you call 
it?"

     "What?"

     "That's just what I want to know.  Oh, I have it now.  I am going to 
what
the lawyers call invest it."

     "A prudent step, admiral, and one which it is to be hoped, before now,
has occurred to you."

     "Perhaps it has and perhaps it hasn't; however, that's my business, and
no one's else's.  I am going to invest my spare cash in taking houses; so, 
as
I don't care a straw where the houses may be situated, you can look out for
one somewhere that will suit you, and I'll take it; so, after all, you will 
be
my guests there just the same as you are here."

     "Admiral," said Henry, "it would be imposing upon a generosity as rare 
as
it is noble, were we to allow you to do so much for us as you contemplate."

     "Very good."

     "We cannot -- we dare not."

     "But I say you shall.  So you have had your say, and I have had mine,
after which, if you please, Master Henry Bannerworth, I shall take upon 
myself
to consider the affair as altogether settled.  You can commence operations 
as
soon as you like.  I know that Miss Flora, here -- bless her sweet eyes --
don't want to stay at Bannerworth Hall any longer than she can help it."

     "Indeed I was urging upon Henry to remove," said Flora; "but yet I 
cannot
help feeling with him, admiral, that we are imposing upon your goodness."

     "Go on imposing, then."

     "But -- "

     "Psha! Can't a man be imposed upon if he likes?  D--n it, that's a poor
privilege for an Englishman to be forced to make a row about.  I tell you I
like it.  I will be imposed upon, so there's an end of that; and now let's
come in and see what Mrs. Bannerworth has got ready for luncheon."

         *         *         *         *         *         *         *

     It can hardly be supposed that such a popular ferment as had been 
created
in the country town, by the singular reports concerning Varney the vampyre,
should readily, and without abundant satisfaction, subside.

     An idea like that which had lent so powerful an impulse to the popular
mind, was one far easier to set going than to deprecate or extinguish.  The
very circumstances which had occurred to toil the excited mob, in their
pursuit of Sir Francis Varney, were of a nature to increase the popular
superstition concerning him, and to make him and his acts appear in still 
more
dreadful colours.

     Mobs do not reason very closely and clearly; but the very fact of the
frantic flight of Sir Francis Varney from the projected attack of the
infuriated multitude, was seized hold of as proof positive of the reality of
his vampyre-like existence.

     Then, again, had he not disappeared in the most mysterious manner?  Had
he not sought refuge where no human being would think of seeking refuge,
namely, in that old, dilapidated ruin, where when his pursuers were so close
upon his track, he had succeed in eluding their grasp with a facility which
looked as if he had vanished into thin air, or as if the very earth had 
opened
to receive him bodily within its cold embraces?

     It is now to be wondered at, that the few who fled so precipitately 
from
the ruin, lost nothing of the wonderful story they had to tell, in the
carrying it from that place to the town. When they reached their neighbours,
they not only told what had really occurred, but they added to it all their
own surmises, and the fanciful creation of all their own fears, so that 
before
mid-day, and about the time when Henry Bannerworth was conversing so quietly
in the gardens of the Hall with his beautiful sister, there was an amount of
popular ferment in the town, of which they had no conception.  All business
was suspended, and many persons, now that once the idea had been started
concerning the possibility that a vampyre might have been visiting some of 
the
houses in the place, told how, in the dead of the night, they had heard
strange noises.  How children had shrieked from no apparent cause -- doors
opened and shut without human agency; and windows rattled that never had 
been
known to rattle before.

     Some, too, went so far as to declare that they had been awakened out of
their sleep by noises incidental to an effort made to enter their chambers;
and others had seen dusky forms of gigantic proportions outside their 
windows,
tampering with their fastenings, and only disappearing when the light of day
mocked all attempts at concealment.

     These tales flew from mouth to mouth, and all listened to them with 
such
an eager interest, that none thought it worth while to challenge their
inconsistencies, or to express a doubt of their truth, because they had not
been mentioned before.

     The only individual, and he was a remarkably clever man, who made the
slightest remark upon the subject of a practical character, hazarded a
suggestion that made confusion worse confounded.

     He knew something of vampyres.  He had travelled abroad, and had heard 
of
them in Germany, as well as in the east, and, to a crowd of wondering and
aghast listeners, he said, --

     "You may depend upon it, my friends, this has been going on for some
time; there have been several mysterious and sudden deaths in the town 
lately;
people have wasted away and died nobody knew how or wherefore."

     "Yes -- yes," said everybody.

     "There was Miles, the butcher; you know of how fat was -- and then how
fat he wasn't."

     A general assent was given to the proposition; and then, elevating one
arm in an oratical manner, the clever fellow continued, --

     "I have not a doubt that Miles, the butcher, and every one else who has
died suddenly lately, have been victims of the vampyre; and what's more,
they'll all be vampyres, and come and suck other people's blood, till at 
last
the whole town will be a town of vampyres."

     "But what's to be done?" cried one, who trembled so excessively that he
could scarcely stand under his apprehension.

     "There is but one plan -- Sir Francis Varney must be found, and put out
of the world in such a manner that he can't come back to it again; and all
those who are dead that we have any suspicion of, should be taken up out of
their graves and looked at, to see if they're rotting or not; if they are 
it's
all right; but, if they look fresh and much as usual, you may depend they're
vampyres, and no mistake."

     This was a terrific suggestion thrown amongst a mob.  To have caught 
Sir
Francis Varney and immolated him at the shrine of popular fury, they would 
not
have shrunk from; but a desecration of the graves of those whom they had 
known
in life was a matter which, however much it had to recommend it, even the
boldest stood aghast at, and felt some qualms of irresolution.  There are 
many
ideas, however, which, like the first plunge into a cold bath, are rather
uncomfortable for the moment; but which, in a little time, we become so
familiarized with, that they become stripped of their disagreeable
concomitants, and appear quite pleasing and natural.

     So in was with this notion of exhuming the dead bodies of those
townspeople who had recently died from what was called a decay of nature, 
and
such other failures of vitality as bore not the tangible name of any
understood disease.

     From mouth to mouth the awful suggestion spread like wildfire, until at
last it grew into such a shape that it almost seemed to become a duty, at 
all
events, to have up Miles the butcher, and see how he looked.  There is, too,
about human nature a natural craving curiosity concerning everything 
connected
with the dead.  There is not a man of education or of intellectual endowment
who would not travel many miles to look upon the exhumation of the remains 
of
some one famous in his time, whether for his vices, his virtues, his
knowledge, his talents, or his heroism; and, if this feeling exist in the
minds of the educated and refined in a sublimated shape, which lends to it
grace and dignity, we may look for it among the vulgar and the ignorant,
taking only a grosser and meaner form, in accordance with their habits of
thought.  The rude materials of which the highest and noblest feelings of
educated minds are formed, will be found amongst the most grovelling and 
base;
and so this vulgar curiosity, which, combined with other feelings, prompted 
an
ignorant and illiterate mob to exhume Miles, the once fat butcher, in a
different form tempted the philosophic Hamlet to moralise upon the skull of
Yorick.

     And it was wonderful to see how, when these people had made up their
minds to carry out the singularly interesting, but, at the same, fearful,
suggestion, they assumed to themselves a great virtue in so doing -- told 
each
other what an absolute necessity, there was, for the public good; that it
should be done; and then, with loud shouts and cries concerning the vampyre,
they proceeded in a body to the village church-yard, where had been lain, 
with
a hope of reposing is peace, the bones of their ancestors.

     A species of savage ferocity now appeared to have seized upon the 
crowd,
and the people, in making up their minds to do something which was 
strikingly
at variance with all their preconceived notions of right and wrong, appeared
to feel that it was necessary, in order that they might be consistent, to 
cast
off many of the decencies of life, and to become riotous and reckless.  As
they proceeded toward the graveyard, they amused themselves by breaking the
windows of the tax-gatherers, and doing what passing mischief they could to
the habitations of all who held any official situation or authority.

     This was something like a proclamation of war against those who might
think it their duty to interfere with the lawless proceedings of an ignorant
multitude.  A public house or two, likewise, _en route_, was sacked of some 
of
its inebriating contents, so that, what with the madness of intoxication, 
and
the general excitement consequent upon the very nature of the business which
took them to the churchyard, a more wild and infuriated multitude than that
which paused at two iron gates which led into the sanctuary of that church
could not be imagined.

     Those who have never seen a mob placed in such a situation as to have
cast off all moral restraint whatever, at the same time that it finds there 
is
no physical power to cope with it, can form no notion of the mass of 
terrible
passions which lie slumbering under what, in ordinary cases, have appeared
harmless bosoms but which now run riot, and overcame every principle of
restraint.  It is a melancholy fact, but, nevertheless, a fact, despite its
melancholy, that, even in a civilised country like this, with a generally
well-educated population, nothing but a well-organized physical force keeps
down, from the commission of the most outrageous offenses, hundreds and
thousands of persons.

     We have said that the mob paused at the iron gates of the churchyard, 
but
it was more a pause of surprise than one of vacillation, because they saw 
that
those iron gates were closed, which had not been the case within the memory 
of
the oldest among them.

     At the first building of the church, and the enclosure of its 
graveyard,
two pairs of these massive gates had been presented by some munificent 
patron;
but, after a time, they hung idly upon their hinges, ornamental certainly, 
but
useless, while a couple of turnstiles, to keep cattle from straying within 
the
sacred precincts, did duty instead, and established, without trouble, the
regular thoroughfare, which long habit had dictated as necessary, through 
the
place of sepulture.

     But now those gates were closed, and for once were doing duty.  Heaven
only knows how they had been moved upon their rusty and time-worn hinges.  
The
mob, however, was checked for the moment, and it was clear that the
ecclesiastical authorities were resolved to attempt something to prevent the
desecration of the tombs.

     Those gates were sufficiently strong to resist the first vigorous shake
which was given to them by some of the foremost among the crowd, and then 
one
fellow started the idea that they might be opened from the inside, and
volunteered to clamber over the wall to do so.

     Hoisted up upon the shoulders of several, he grasped the top of the 
wall,
and raised his head above its level, and then something of a mysterious 
nature
rose up from the inside, and dealt him such a whack between the eyes, that
down he went sprawling among his coadjutors.  Now, nobody had seen how this
injury had been inflicted, and the policy of those in the garrison should 
have
been certainly to keep up the mystery, and leave the invaders in ignorance 
of
what sort of person it was that had so foiled them.  Man, however, is prone 
to
indulge in vain glorification, and the secret was exploded by the triumphant
waving of the long staff of the beadle, with the gilt knob at the end of it,
just over the parapet of the wall, in token of victory.

     "It's Waggles! it's Waggles!" cried everybody; "it's Waggles, the
beadle!"

     "Yes," said a voice from within, "it's Waggles, the beadle; and he 
thinks
as he had yer there rather; try it again.  The church isn't in danger; oh, 
no.
What do you think of this?"

     The staff was flourished more vigorously than ever, and in the secure
position that Waggles occupied it seemed not only impossible to attack him,
but that he possessed wonderful powers of resistance, for the staff was long
and the knob was heavy.

     It was a boy who hit upon the ingenious expedient of throwing up a 
great
stone, so that it just fell inside the wall, and hit Waggles a great blow on
the head.

     The staff was flourished more vigorously than ever, and the mob, in the
ecstasy at the fun which was going on, almost forgot the errand which had
brought them.  Perhaps after all the affair might have passed off jestingly,
had not there been some really mischievous persons among the throng who were
determined that such should not be the case, and they incited the multitude 
to
commence an attack upon the gates, which in a few moments must have produced
their entire demolition.

     Suddenly, however, the boldest drew back, and there was a pause, as the
well-known form of the clergyman appeared advancing from the church door,
attired in full canonicals.

     "There's Mr. Leigh," said several; "how unlucky he should be here."

     "What is this?" said the clergyman, approaching the gates. "Can I 
believe
my eyes when I see before me those who compose the worshippers at this 
church
armed, and attempting to enter for the purpose of violence to this sacred
place!  Oh! let me beseech you, lose not a moment, but return to your homes,
and repent of that which you have already done.  It is not yet too late;
listen, I pray you, to the voice of one with whom you have so often joined 
in
prayer to the throne of the Almighty, who is now looking upon your actions."

     This appeal was heard respectfully, but it was evidently very far from
suiting the feelings and the wishes of those to whom it was addressed; the
presence of the clergyman was evidently an unexpected circumstance, and the
more especially too as he appeared in that costume which they had been
accustomed to regard with a reverence almost amounting to veneration.  He 
saw
the favourable effect he had produced, and anxious to follow it up, he 
added,
--

     "Let this little ebullition of feeling pass away, my friends; and,
believe me, when I assure you upon my sacred word, that whatever ground 
there
may be for complaint or subject for inquiry, shall be fully and fairly met;
and that the greatest exertions shall be made to restore peace and
tranquillity to all of you."

     "It's all about the vampyre!" cried one fellow.  "Mr. Leigh, how should
you like a vampyre in the pulpit?"

     "Hush, hush! can it be possible that you know so little of the works of
that great Being whom you all pretend to adore, as to believe that he would
create any class of beings of a nature such as those you ascribe to that
terrific word?  Oh, let me pray of you to get rid of these superstitions --
alike disgraceful to yourselves and afflicting to me."

     The clergyman had the satisfaction of seeing the crowd rapidly thinning
from before the gates, and he believed his exhortations were having all the
effect he wished.  It was not until he heard a loud shout behind him and, 
upon
hastily turning, saw that the churchyard had been scaled at another place by
some fifty or sixty persons, that his heart sunk within him, and he began to
feel that what he had dreaded would surely come to pass.

     Even then he might have done something in the way of pacific exertion,
but for the interference of Waggles, the beadle, who spoilt everything.

 Next Time: The Open Graves. -- The Dead Bodies. -- A Scene of Terror.




                                Chapter XLV.

THE OPEN GRAVES. -- THE DEAD BODIES. -- A SCENE OF TERROR.


     We have said Waggles spoilt everything, and so he did, for before Mr.
Leigh could utter a word more, or advance a few steps towards the rioters,
Waggles charged them staff in hand, and there soon ensued a riot of a most
formidable description.

     A kind of desperation seemed to have seized the beadle, and certainly, 
by
his sudden and unexpected attack, he achieved wonders.  When, however, a 
dozen
hands got hold of the staff, and it was wrenched from him, and he was 
knocked
down, and half- a-dozen people rolled over him, Waggles was not near the man
he had been, and he would have been very well content to have lain quiet 
where
he was; this however, he was not permitted to do for two or three, who had
felt what a weighty instrument of warfare a parochial staff was, lifted him
bodily from the ground, and canted him over the wall, without much regard to
whether he fell on a hard or a soft place on the other side.

     This feat accomplished, no further attention was paid to Mr. Leigh, 
who,
finding that his exhortations were quite unheeded, retired into the church
with an appearance of deep affliction about him, and locked himself in the
vestry.

     The crowd now had entire possession -- without even the sort of control
that an exhortation assumed over them -- of the burying-ground, and soon in 
a
dense mass were these desperate and excited people collected round the well-
known spot where lay the mortal remains of Miles, the butcher.

     "Silence!" cried a loud voice, and every one obeyed the mandate, 
looking
towards the speaker, who was a tall, gaunt- looking man, attired in a suit 
of
faded black, and who now pressed forward to the front of the throng.

     "Oh!" cried one, "it's Fletcher, the ranter.  What does he do here?"

     "Hear him! hear him!" cried others; "he won't stop us."

     "Yes, hear him," cried the tall man, waving his arms about like the 
sails
of a windmill.  "Yes, hear him.  Sons of darkness; you're all vampyres, and
are continually sucking the life-blood from each other.  No wonder that the
evil one has power over you all.  You're as men who walk in the darkness 
when
the sunlight invites you, and you listen often to the words of humanity when
those of a diviner origin are offered to your acceptance.  But there shall 
be
miracles in the land, and even in this place, set apart with a pretended 
piety
that is in itself most damnable, you shall find an evidence of the true 
light;
and the proof that those who will follow me the true path to glory shall be
found here within this grave.  Dig up Miles, the butcher!"

     "Hear, hear, hear, hurra!" said everybody.  "Mr. Fletcher's not such a
fool, after all.  He means well."

     "Yes, you sinners," said the ranter, "and if you find Miles, the 
butcher,
decaying -- even as men are expected to decay whose mortal tabernacles are
placed within the bowels of the earth -- you shall gather from that a great
omen, and a sign that if you follow me you seek the Lord; but if you find 
him
looking fresh and healthy, as if the warm blood was still within his veins,
you shall take that likewise as a signification that what I say to you shall
be as the Gospel, and that by coming to the chapel of the Little Boozlehum, 
ye
shall achieve great salvation."

     "Very good," said a brawny fellow, advancing with a spade in his hand;
"you get out of the way, and I'll soon have him up. Here goes like blue
blazes!"

     The first shovelful of earth he took up, he cast over his head into the
air, so that it fell in a shower among the mob, which of course raised a 
shout
of indignation; and, as he continued so to dispose of the superfluous earth, 
a
general row seemed likely to ensue.  Mr. Fletcher opened his mouth to make a
remark, and, as that feature of his face was rather a capacious one, a
descending lump of mould, of a clayey consistency, fell into it, and got so
wedged among his teeth, that in the process of extracting it he nearly 
brought
some of those essential portions of his anatomy with it.

     This was a state of things that could not last long, and he who had 
been
so liberal with his spadesful of mould was speedily disarmed, and yet he was 
a
popular favourite, and had done the thing so good-humouredly, that nobody
touched him.  Six or eight others, who had brought spades and pickaxes, now
pushed forward to the work, and in an incredibly short space of time the 
grave
of Miles, the butcher, seemed to be very nearly excavated.

     Work of any kind or nature whatever, is speedily executed when done 
with
a wish to get through it; and never, perhaps, within the memory of man, was 
a
grave opened in that churchyard with such a wonderful celerity.  The
excitement of the crowd grew intense -- every available spot from which a 
view
of the grave could he got, was occupied; for the last few minutes scarcely a
remark had been uttered, and when, at last, the spade of one of whose who 
were
digging, struck upon something that sounded like wood, you might have heard 
a
pin drop, and each one there present drew his breath more shortly than 
before.

     "There he is," said the man, whose spade struck upon the coffin.

     Those few words broke the spell, and there was a general murmur, while
every individual present seemed to shift his position in his anxiety to 
obtain
a better view of what was about to ensue.

     The coffin now having been once found, there seemed to be an increased
impetus given to the work; the earth was thrown out with a rapidity that
seemed almost the quick result of the working of some machine; and those
closest to the grave's brink crouched down, and, intent as they were upon 
the
progress of events, heeded not the damp earth that fell upon them, nor the
frail brittle and humid remains of humanity that occasionally rolled to 
their
feet  It was, indeed, a scene of intense excitement -- a scene which only
wanted a few prominent features in its foreground of a more intellectual and
higher cast than composed the mob, to make it a fit theme for a painter of 
the
highest talent.

     And now the last few shovelfuls of earth that hid the top of the coffin
were cast from the grave, and that narrow house which contained the mortal
remains of him who was so well known, while in life, to almost every one 
then
present, was brought to the gaze of eyes which never had seemed likely to 
have
looked upon him again.

     The cry was now for ropes, with which to raise the cumbrous mass; but
these were not to be had, no one thought of providing himself with such
appliances, so that by main strength, only, could the coffin be raised to 
the
brink.

     The difficulty of doing this was immense, for there was nothing 
tangible
to stand upon; and even when the mould from the sides was sufficiently 
cleared
away, that the handles of the coffin could be laid hold of, they came away
immediately in the grasp of those who did so.

     But the more trouble that presented itself to the accomplishment of the
designs of the mob, the more intent that body seemed upon carrying out to 
the
full extent their original designs.

     Finding it quite impossible by bodily strength to raise the coffin of 
the
butcher from the position in which it had got embedded by excessive rains, a
boy was hastily despatched to the village for ropes, and never did boy run
with such speed before, for all his own curiosity was excited in the issue 
of
an adventure, that to his young imagination was appallingly interesting.

     As impatient as mobs usually are, they had not time, in this case, for
the exercise of that quality of mind before the boy came back with the
necessary means of exerting quite a different species of power against the
butcher's coffin.

     Strong ropes were slid under the inert mass, and twenty hands at once
plied the task of raising that receptacle of the dead from what had been
presumed to be its last resting-place. The ropes strained and creaked, and
many thought that they would burst asunder sooner than raise the coffin of 
the
defunct butcher.

     It is singular what reasons people find for backing their opinion.

     "You may depend he's a vampyre," said one, "or it wouldn't be so
difficult to get him out of the grave."

     "Oh, there can be no mistake about that," said one; "when did a natural
Christian's coffin stick in the mud in that way?"

     "Ah, to be sure," said another; "I knew no good would come of his 
goings
on; he never was a decent sort of man like his neighbours, and many queer
things have been said of him that I have no doubt are true enough, if we did
but know the rights of them."

     "Ah, but," said a young lad, thrusting his head between the two who 
were
talking, "if he is a vampyre, how does he get out of his coffin of a night
with all that weight of mould a top of him?"

     One of the men considered for a moment, and then finding no rational
answer occur to him, he gave the boy a box on the ear, saying,--

     "I should like to know what business that is of yours? Boys, now-a-
days,
ain't like the boys in my time; they think nothing now of putting their 
spoke
in grown-up people's wheels, just as if their opinions were of any
consequence."

     Now by a vigorous effort, those who were tugging at the ropes succeeded
in moving the coffin a little, and that first step was all the difficulty, 
for
it was loosened from that adhesive soil in which it lay, and now came up 
with
considerable facility.

     There was a half shout of satisfaction at this result, while some of 
the
congregation turned pale, and trembled at the prospect of the sight which 
was
about to present itself; the coffin was dragged from the grave's brink 
fairly
among the long rank grass that flourished in the churchyard, and then they 
all
looked at it for a time, and the men who had been most earnest in raising it
wiped the perspiration from their brows, and seemed to shrink from the task 
of
opening that receptacle of the dead now that it was fairly in their power so
to do.

     Each man looked anxiously in his neighbours' face, and several audibly
wondered why somebody else didn't open the coffin.

     "There's no harm in it," said one; "if he's a vampyre, we ought to know
it; and, if he ain't, we can't do any hurt to a dead man."

     "Oughten't we to have the service for the dead?" said one.

     "Yes," said the impertinent boy who had before received the knock on 
the
head, "I think we ought to have that read, back- wards."

     This ingenious idea was recompensed by a great many kicks and cuffs,
which ought to have been sufficient to have warned him of the great danger 
of
being a little before his age in wit.

     "Where's the use of shirking the job?" cried he who had been so active 
in
shoveling the mud upon the multitude; "why, you cowardly sneaking set of
humbugs, you're half afraid, now."

     "Afraid -- afraid!" cried everybody; "who's afraid?"

     "Ah, who's afraid?" said a little man, advancing, and assuming an 
heroic
attitude; "I always notice, if anybody's afraid, it's some big fellow, with
more bones than brains."

     At this moment, the man to whom this reproach was more particularly
leveled, raised a horrible shout of terror, and cried out, in frantic 
accents,
--

     "He's a-coming -- he's a-coming!"

     The little man fell at once into the grave, while the mob, with one
accord, turned tail, and fled in all directions, leaving him alone with the
coffin.  Such a fighting, and kicking, and scrambling ensued to get over the
wall of the grave-yard, that this great fellow, who had caused all the
mischief, burst into such peals of laughter that the majority of the people
became aware that it was a joke, and came creeping back, looking as sheepish
as possible.

     Some got up very faint sorts of laugh, and said "very good," and swore
they saw what big Dick meant from the first, and only ran to make the others
run.

     "Very good," said Dick.  "I'm glad you enjoyed it, that's all.  My eye,
what a scampering there was among you.  Where's my little friend, who was so
infernally cunning about bones and brains?"

     With some difficulty the little man was extricated from the grave, and
then, oh, for the consistency of a mob! they all laughed at him; those very
people who, heedless of all the amenities of existence, had been trampling
upon each other and roaring with terror, actually had the impudence to laugh
at him, and call him a cowardly little rascal, and say it served him right.

     But such is popularity!

     "Well, if nobody won't open the coffin," said big Dick, "I will, so 
here
goes.  I knowed the old fellow when he was alive and many a time he's d----d
me and I d----d him, so I ain't a- going to be afraid of him now he's dead. 
We was very intimate you see, 'cos we was the two heaviest men in the 
parish;
there's a reason for every thing."

     "Ah, Dick's the fellow to do it," cried a number of persons; "there's
nobody like Dick for opening a coffin; he's the man as don't care for
nothing."

     "Ah, you snivelling curs," said Dick, "I hate you.  If it warn't for my
own satisfaction, and all for to prove why my old friend, the butcher, as
weighed seventeen stone, and stood six feet two and-a-half on his own sole,
l'd see you all jolly well -- "

     "D----d first," said the boy; "open the lid, Dick, let's have a look."

     "Ah, you're a rum un," said Dick, "arter my own heart.  I sometimes
thinks as you must be a nevy, or some sort of relation of mine.  
Howsomdever,
here goes.  Who'd thought that I should ever had a look at old fat and 
thunder
again? -- that's what I used to call him; and then he used to request me to 
go
down below, where I needn't turn round to light my blessed pipe."

     "Hell -- we know," said the boy; "why don't you open the lid, Dick?"

     "I'm a going," said Dick; "kim up."

     He introduced the corner of a shovel between the lid and the coffin, 
and
giving it a sudden wrench, he loosened it all down one side.

     A shudder pervaded the multitude, and, popularly speaking, you might 
have
heard a pin drop in that crowded churchyard at that eventful moment.

     Dick then proceeded to the other side, and executed the same manoeuvre.

     "Now for it," he said; "we shall see him in a moment, and we'll think; 
we
seed him still."

     "What a lark!" said the boy.

     "You hold yer jaw, will yer?  Who axed you for a remark, blow yer?  
What
do you mean by squatting down there, like a cock-sparrow, with a pain in his
tail, hanging yer head, too, right over the coffin?  Did you never hear of
what they call a fluvifium, coming from the dead, yer ignorant beast, as is
enough to send nobody to blazes in a minute?  Get out of the way of the cold
meat, will yer!"

     "A what, do you say, Dick?"

     "Request information from the extreme point of my elbow."

     Dick threw down the spade, and laying hold of the coffin- lid with both
hands, he lifted it off, and flung it on one side.

     There was a visible movement and an exclamation among the multitude. 
Some were pushed down, in the eager desire of those behind to obtain a sight
of the ghastly remains of the butcher; those at a distance were frantic, and
the excitement was momentarily increasing.

     They might all have spared themselves the trouble, for the coffin was
empty -- there was no dead butcher, nor any evidence of one ever having been
there, not even the grave-clothes; the only thing in all in the receptacle 
of
the dead was a brick. Dick's astonishment was so intense that his eyes and
mouth kept opening together to such an extent, that it seemed doubtful when
they would reach their extreme point of elongation.  He then took up the 
brick
and looked at it curiously, and turned it over and over, examined the ends 
and
the sides with a critical eye, and at length he said, --

     "Well, I'm blowed, here's a transmogrification; he's consolidified
himself into a blessed brick -- my eye, here's a curiosity."

     "But you don't mean to say that's the butcher, Dick ?" said the boy.

     Dick reached over, and gave him a tap on the head with the brick.

     "There!" he said, "that's what I calls occular demonstration.  Do you
believe it now, you blessed infidel? What's more natural?  He was an out-
and-
out brick while he was alive; and he's turned to a brick now he's dead."

     "Give it to me, Dick," said the boy; "I should like to have that brick,
just for the fun of the thing."

     "I'll see you turned into a pantile first.  I sha'n't part with this
here, it looks too blessed sensible; it's gaining on me every minute as a 
most
remarkable likeness, d----d if it ain't."

     By this time the bewilderment of the mob had subsided; now that there 
was
no dead butcher to look upon, they fancied themselves most grievously 
injured;
and; somehow or other, Dick, notwithstanding all his exertions in their
service, was looked upon in the light of a showman, who had promised some
startling exhibition and then had disappointed his auditors.

     The first intimations he had of popular vengeance was a stone thrown at
him, but Dick's eye happened to be upon the fellow who threw it, and 
collaring
him in a moment, he dealt him a cuff on the side of the head, which confused
his faculties for a week.

     "Hark ye," he then cried, with a loud voice, "don't interfere with me; 
it
won't go down.  There's something wrong here; and, as one of yourselves, I'm
as much interested in finding out what it is as any of you can possibly be.  
There seems to be some truth in this business; our old friend, the butcher,
you see, is not in his grave; where is he then?"

     The mob, looked at each other and none attempted to answer the 
question.

     "Why, of course, he's the vampyre," said Dick, "and you may all of you
expect to see him, in turn, come into your bed-room windows with a burst, 
and
lay hold of you like a million and a half of leeches rolled into one."

     There was a general expression of horror, and then Dick continued, --

     "You'd better all of you go home; I shall have no hand in pulling up 
any
more of the coffins -- this is a dose for me.  Of course you can do what you
like."

     "Pull them all up!" cried a voice; "pull them all up!  Let's see how 
many
vampyres there are in the churchyard."

     "Well, it's no business of mine," said Dick; "but I wouldn't, if I was
you."

      "You may depend," said one, "that Dick knows something about it, or he
wouldn't take it so easy."

     "Ah! down with him," said the man who had received the box on the ears;
"he's perhaps a vampyre himself."

     The mob made a demonstration towards him, but Dick stood his ground, 
and
they paused again.

     "Now, you're a cowardly set," he said; "because you're disappointed, 
you
want to come upon me.  Now, I'll just show what a little thing will frighten
you all again and I warn beforehand it will, so you sha'n't say you didn't
know it, and were taken by surprise."

     The mob looked at him, wondering what he was going to do. "Once! twice!
thrice!" he said, and then he flung the brick up into the air an immense
height, and shouted "heads," in a loud tone.

     A general dispersion of the crowd ensued, and the brick fell in the
centre of a very large circle indeed.

     "There you are again," said Dick; "why, what a nice set you are!"

     "What fun!" said the boy.  "It's a famous coffin, this, Dick," and he
laid himself down in the butcher's last resting place.  "I never was in a
coffin before -- it's snug enough."

     "Ah, you are a rum 'un," said Dick; "you're such a inquiring genius, 
you
is; you'll get your head in a some hole one day, and not be able to get it 
out
again and then I shall see you a kicking.  Hush! lay still -- don't say
anything."

     "Good again," said the boy; "what shall I do?"

     "Give a sort of a howl and a squeak, when they all come back again."

     "Won't I!" said the boy; "a pop on the lid."

     "There you we," said Dick; "d----d if I don't adopt you, and bring you 
up
to the science of nothing."

     "Now, listen to me, good people all," added Dick; "I have really got
something to say to you."

     At this intimation the people slowly gathered again round the grave. 
"Listen," said Dick, solemnly; "it strikes me there's some tremendous do 
going
on."

     "Yes, there is," said several who were foremost.

     "It won't be long before you'll all of you be most d--nably astonished;
but let me beg of all you not to accuse me of having anything to do with it,
provided I tell you all I know."

     "No, Dick; we won't -- we won't -- we won't."

     "Good; then, listen.  I don't know anything, but I'll tell you what I
think, and that's as good.  I don't think that this brick is the butcher; 
but
I think, that when you least expect it -- hush! come it little closer."

     "Yes, yes; we are closer."

     "Well, then, I say, when you least expect it, and when you ain't 
dreaming
of such a thing, you'll hear something of my old friend as is dead and gone,
that will astonish you all."

     Dick paused, and he gave the coffin a slight kick, as intimation to the
boy that he might as well be doing his part in the drama, upon which that
ingenious young gentleman set up such a howl, that even Dick jumped, so
unearthly did if sound within the confines of that receptacle of the dead.

     But if the effect upon him was great, what must it have been upon those
whom it took completely unaware?  For a moment or two they seemed completely
paralysed, and then they frightened the boy, for the shout of terror that 
rose
from so many throats at once was positively alarming.

     This jest of Dick's was final, for, before three minutes had elapsed, 
the
churchyard was clear of all human occupants save himself and the boy, who 
had
played his part so well in the coffin.

     "Get out," said Dick; "it's all right -- we've done 'em at last; and 
now
you may depend upon it they won't be in a hurry to come here again.  You 
keep
you own counsel, or else somebody will serve you out for this.  I don't 
think
you're altogether averse to a bit of fun, and if you keep yourself quiet
you'll have the satisfaction of hearing what's said about this affair in 
every
pothouse in the village, and no mistake."

 Next Time: The Preparations for Leaving Bannerworth Hall, and the 
Mysterious
 Conduct of the Admiral and Mr. Chillingworth.




                                Chapter XLVI.

THE PREPARATIONS FOR LEAVING BANNERWORTH HALL, AND THE MYSTERIOUS CONDUCT OF
THE ADMIRAL AND MR. CHILLINGWORTH.


     It seemed now, that, by the concurrence of all parties, Bannerworth 
Hall
was to be abandoned; and, notwithstanding Henry was loth -- as he had, 
indeed,
from the first shown himself -- to leave the ancient abode of his race, yet,
as not only Flora, but the admiral and his friend Mr. Chillingworth seemed 
to
be of opinion that it would be a prudent course to adopt, he felt that it
would not become him to oppose the measure.

     He, however, now made his consent to depend wholly upon the full and 
free
acquiescence of every member of the family.

     "If," he said, "there be any among us who will say to me 'Continue to
keep open the house in which we have passed so many happy hours, and let the
ancient home of our race still afford a shelter to us' I shall feel myself
bound to do so; but if both my mother and my brother agree to a departure 
from
it, and that its hearth shall be left cold and desolate, be it so.  I will 
not
stand in the way of any unanimous wish or arrangement."

     "We may consider that, then, as settled," said the admiral, "for I have
spoken to your brother, and he is of our opinion. Therefore, my boy, we may
all be off as soon as we can conveniently get under weigh."

     "But my mother?"

     "Oh, there, I don't know.  You must speak to her yourself. I never, if 
I
can help it, interfere with the women folks."

     "If she consent, then I am willing."

     "Will you ask her?"

     "I will not ask her to leave, because I know, then, what answer she 
would
at once give; but she shall hear the proposition, and I will leave her to
decide upon it, unbiassed in her judgment by any stated opinion of mine upon
the matter."

     "Good.  That'll do; and the proper way to put it, too. There's no 
mistake
about that, I can tell you."

     Henry, although he went through the ceremony of consulting his mother,
had no sort of doubt before he did so that she was sufficiently aware of the
feelings and wishes of Flora to be prepared to yield a ready assent to the
proposition of leaving the Hall.

     Moreover, Mr. Marchdale had, from the first, been an advocate of such a
course of proceeding, and Henry well knew how strong an influence he had 
over
Mrs. Bannerworth's mind, in consequence of the respect in which she held him
as an old and valued friend.

     He was, therefore, prepared for what his mother said, which was, --

     "My dear Henry, you know that the wishes of my children, since they 
have
been grown up and capable of coming to a judgment for themselves, have ever
been laws to me.  If you, among you all, agree to leave this place, do so."

     "But will you leave it freely, mother?"

     "Most freely I go with you all; what is it that has made this house and
all its appurtenances pleasant in my eyes, but the presence in it of those 
who
are so dear to me?  If you all leave it, you take with you the only charms 
it
ever possessed; so it becomes in itself as nothing.  I am quite ready to
accompany you all anywhere, so that we do but keep together."

     "Then, mother, we may consider that as settled."

     "As you please."

     "It is scarcely as I please.  I must confess that I would fain have 
clung
with a kind of superstitious reverence to this ancient abiding-place of my
race, but it may not be so.  Those, perchance, who are more practically able
to come to correct conclusions, in consequence of their feelings not being
sufficiently interested to lead them astray, have decided otherwise; and,
therefore, I am content to leave."

     "Do not grieve at it, Henry.  There has hung a cloud of misfortune over
us all since the garden of this house became the scene of an event which we
can none of us remember but with terror and shuddering."

     "Two generations of our family must live and die before the remembrance
of that circumstance can be obliterated.  But we will think of it no more."

     There can no doubt but that the dreadful circumstance to which both 
Mrs.
Bannerworth and Henry alluded, was the suicide of the father of the family 
in
the gardens which before has been hinted at in the course of this narration,
as being a circumstance which had created a great sensation at the time, and
cast a great gloom for many months over the family.

     The reader will, doubtless, too, recollect that, at his last moments,
this unhappy individual was said to have uttered some incoherent words about
some hidden money, and that the rapid hand of death alone seemed to prevent
him from being explicit upon that subject, and left it merely a matter of
conjecture.

     As years had rolled on, this affair, even as a subject of speculation,
had ceased to occupy the minds of any of the Bannerworth family, and several
of their friends, among whom was Mr. Marchdale, were decidedly of the 
opinion
that the apparently pointed and mysterious words uttered, were but the
disordered wanderings of an intellect already hovering on the confines of
eternity.

     Indeed, far from any money, of any amount, being a disturbance to the
last moments of the dissolute man, whose vices and extravagances had brought
his family to such ruin, it was pretty generally believed that he had
committed suicide simply from a conviction of the impossibility of raising 
any
more supplies of cash, to enable him to carry on the career which he had
pursued for so long.

     But to resume.

     Henry at once communicated to the admiral what his mother had said, and
then the whole question regarding the removal being settled in the
affirmative, nothing remained to be done but to set about it as quickly as
possible.

     The Bannerworths lived sufficiently distant from the town to be out of
earshot of the disturbances which were then taking place; and so completely
isolated were they from all sort of society, that they had no notion of the
popular disturbance which Varney the vampyre had given rise to.

     It was not until the following morning that Mr. Chillingworth, who had
been home in the meantime, brought word of what had taken place, and that
great commotion was still in the town, and that the civil authorities, 
finding
themselves by far too weak to contend against the popular will, had sent for
assistance to a garrison town, some twenty miles distant.

     It was a great grief to the Bannerworth family to hear these tidings, 
not
that they were in any way, except as victims, accessory to creating the
disturbance about the vampyre, but it seemed to promise a kind of notoriety
which they might well shrink from, and which they were just the people to 
view
with dislike.

     View the matter how we like, however, it is not to be considered as at
all probably that the Bannerworth family would remain long in ignorance of
what a great sensation they had created unwittingly in the neighbourhood.

     The very reasons which had induced their servants to leave their
establishment, and prefer throwing themselves completely out of place, 
rather
than remain in so ill-omened a house, were sure to be bruited abroad far and
wide.

     And that, perhaps, when they came to consider of it, would suffice to
form another good and substantial reason for leaving the Hall, and seeking a
refuge in obscurity from the extremely troublesome sort of popularity
incidental to their peculiar situation.

     Mr. Chillingworth felt uncommonly chary of telling them all that had
taken place; although he was well aware that the proceedings of the riotous
mob had not terminated with the little disappointment at the old ruin, to
which they had so effectually chased Varney the vampyre, but to lose him so
singularly when he got there.

     No doubt he possessed the admiral with the uproar that was going on in
the town, for the latter did hint a little of it to Henry Bannerworth.

     "Hilloa!" he said to Henry, as he saw him walking in the garden; "it
strikes me if you or your ship's crew continue in these latitudes, you'll 
get
as notorious as the Flying Dutchman in the southern ocean."

     "How do you mean?" said Henry.

     "Why, it's a sure going proverb to say, that a nod's as good as a wink;
but, the fact is, it's getting rather too well known to be pleasant, that a
vampyre has struck up a rather close acquaintance with your family.  I
understand there's a precious row in the town."

     "Indeed!"

     "Yes; bother the particulars, for I don't know them; but, hark ye, by 
to-
morrow I'll have found a place for you to go to, so pack up the sticks, get
all your stores ready to clear out, and make yourself scarce from this 
place."

     "I understand you," said Henry; "we have become the subject of popular
rumour; I've only to beg of you, admiral, that you'll say nothing of this to
Flora; she has already suffered enough, Heaven knows; do not let her have 
the
additional affliction of thinking that her name is made familiar in every
pothouse in the town."

     "Leave me alone for that," said the admiral.  "Do you think I'm an 
ass?"

     "Ay, ay," said Jack Pringle, who came in at that moment, and thought 
the
question was addressed to him.

     "Who spoke to you, you bad-looking horse-marine?"

     "Me a horse-marine! didn't you ask a plain question of a fellow, and 
get
a plain answer?"

     "Why, you son of a bad looking gun, what do you mean by that?  I tell 
you
what it is, Jack; I've let you come sneaking too often on the quarter-deck,
and now you come poking your fun at your officers, you rascal!"

     "I poking fun!" said Jack; "couldn't think of such a thing. I should 
just
as soon think of your making a joke as me."

     "Now, I tell you what it is, I shall just strike you off the ship's
books, and you shall just go and cruise by yourself; I've done with you."

     "Go and tell that to the marines, if you like," said Jack. "I ain't 
done
with you yet, for a jolly long watch.  Why, what do you suppose would become
of you, you great babby, without me?  Ain't I always a conveying you from
place to place, and steering you through all sorts of difficulties?"

     "D--n your impudence!"

     "Well, then, d--n yours."

     "Shiver my timbers!"

     "Ay, you may do what you like with your own timbers."

     "And you won't leave me?"

     "Sartingly not."

     "Come here, then?"

     Jack might have expected a gratuity, for he advanced with alacrity.

     "There," said the admiral, as he laid his stick across his shoulders;
"that's your last month's wages; don't spend it all at once."

     "Well, I'm d----d!" said Jack; "who'd have thought of that? -- he's
turning rumgumptious, and no mistake.  Howsomedever, I must turn it over in 
my
mind, and be even with him, somehow -- I owes him one for that.  I say,
admiral."

     "What now, you lubber?"

     "Nothing; turn that over in your mind;" and away Jack walked, not quite
satisfied, but feeling, at least, that he had made a demonstration of 
attack.

     As for the admiral, he considered that the thump he had given Jack with
the stick, and it was no gentle one, as a decided balancing of accounts up 
to
that period, and as he remained likewise master of the field, he was upon 
the
whole very well satisfied.

     These last few words which had been spoken to Henry by Admiral Bell, 
more
than any others, induced him to hasten his departure from Bannerworth Hall; 
he
had walked away when the altercation between Jack Pringle and the admiral
began, for he had seen sufficient of those wordy conflicts between those
originals to be quite satisfied that neither of them meant what he said of a
discouraging character towards the other, and that far from there being any
unfriendly feeling contingent upon those little affairs, they were only a
species of friendly sparring, which both parties enjoyed extremely.

     Henry went direct to Flora, and he said to her, --

     "Since we are all agreed upon the necessity, or, at all events, upon 
the
expediency of a departure from the Hall, I think, sister, the sooner we 
carry
out that determination the better and the pleasanter for us all it will be. 
Do you think you could remove so hastily as to-morrow?"

     "To-morrow!  That is soon indeed."

     "I grant you that it is so; but Admiral Bell assures me that he will 
have
everything in readiness, and a place provided for us to go to by then."

     "Would it be possible to remove from a house like this so very 
quickly?"

     "Yes, sister.  If you look around you, you will see that a great 
portion
of the comforts you enjoy in this mansion belong to it as a part of its very
structure, and are not removable at pleasure; what we really have to take 
away
is very little.  The urgent want of money during our father's lifetime 
induced
him, as you may recollect even, at various times to part with much that was
ornamental, as well as useful, which was in the Hall.  You will recollect 
that
we seldom returned from those little continental tours which to us were so
delightful, without finding some old familiar objects gone, which, upon
inquiry, we found had been turned into money, to meet some more than usually
pressing demand."

     "That is true, brother; I recollect well."

     "So that, upon the whole, sister, there is little to remove."

     "Well, well, be it so.  I will prepare our mother for this sudden step. 
Believe me, my heart goes with it; and as a force of vengeful circumstances
have induced us to remove from this home, which was once so full of pleasant
recollections, it is certainly better, as you say, that the act should be at
once consummated, than left hanging in terror over our minds."

     "Then I'll consider that as settled," said Henry.

 Next Time: The Removal from the Hall. -- The Night Watch, and the Alarm.




                               Chapter XLVII.

THE REMOVAL FROM THE HALL. -- THE NIGHT WATCH, AND THE ALARM.


     Mrs. Bannerworth's consent having been already given to the removal, 
she
said at once, when appealed to, that she was quite ready to go at any time 
her
children thought expedient.

     Upon this, Henry sought the admiral, and told him as much, at the same
time adding, --

     "My sister feared that we should have considerable trouble in the
removal, but I have convinced her that such will not be the case, as we are 
by
no means overburdened with cumbrous property."

     "Cumbrous property," said the admiral, "why, what do you mean?  I beg
leave to say, that when I took the house, I took the table and chairs with 
it.
D--n it, what good do you suppose an empty house is to me?"

     "The tables and chairs?"

     "Yes.  I took the house just as it stands.  Don't try and bamboozle me
out of it.  I tell you, you've nothing to move but yourselves and immediate
personal effects."

     "I was not aware, admiral, that that was your plan."

     "Well, then, now you are, listen to me.  I've circumvented the enemy 
too
often not to know how to get up a plot.  Jack and I have managed it all.  
To-
morrow evening, after dark, and before the moon's got high enough to throw 
any
light, you and your brother, and Miss Flora and your mother, will come out 
of
the house, and Jack and I will lead you where you're to go to. There's 
plenty
of furniture where you're a-going, and so you will get off free, without
anybody knowing anything about it."

     "Well, admiral, I've said it before, and it is the unanimous opinion of
us all, that everything should be left to you.  You have proved yourself too
good a friend to us for us to hesitate at all in obeying your commands. 
Arrange everything, I pray you, according to your wishes and feelings, and 
you
will find there shall be no cavilling on our parts."

     "That's right; there's nothing like giving a command to some one 
person. 
There's no good done without.  Now I'll manage it all.  Mind you, seven
o'clock to-morrow evening everything is to be ready, and you will all be
prepared to leave the Hall."

     "It shall be so."

     "Who's that giving such a thundering ring at the gate?"

     "Nay, I know not.  We have few visitors and no servants, so I must e'en
be my own gate porter."

     Henry walked to the gate, and having opened it, a servant in a handsome
livery stepped a pace or two into the garden.

     "Well," said Henry.

     "Is Mr. Henry Bannerworth within, or Admiral Bell?"

     "Both," cried the admiral.  "I'm Admiral Bell, and this is Mr. Henry
Bannerworth.  What do you want with us, you d----d gingerbread-looking
flunkey?"

     "Sir, my master desires his compliments -- his very best compliments --
and he wants to know how you are after your flurry."

     "What?"

     "After your -- a -- a -- flurry and excitement."

     "Who is your master?" said Henry.

     "Sir Francis Varney."

     "The devil!" said the admiral; "if that don't beat all the impudence I
ever came near.  Our flurry!  Ah! I like that fellow. Just go and tell him -
-
"

     "No, no," said Henry, interposing, "send back no message. Say to your
master, fellow, that Mr. Henry Bannerworth feels that not only has he no 
claim
to Sir Francis Varney's courtesy, but that he should rather be without it."

     "Oh, ha!" said the footman, adjusting his collar; "very good.  This 
seems
a d----d, old-fashioned, outlandish place of yours.  Any ale?"

     "Now, shiver my hulks!" said the admiral.

     "Hush! hush!" said Henry; "who knows but there may be a design in this? 
We have no ale."

     "Oh, ah! dem! -- dry as dust, by God!  What does the old commodore say? 
Any message, my ancient Greek?"

     "No, thank you," said the admiral; "bless you, nothing. What did you 
give
for that waistcoat, d--n you?  Ha! ha! you're a clever fellow."

     "Ah! the old gentleman's ill.  However, I'll take back his compliments,
and that he's much obliged at Sir Francis's condescension.  At the same 
time,
I suppose I may place in my eye what I may get out of either of you, without
hindering me seeing my way back.  Ha! ha! Adieu -- adieu."

     "Bravo!" said the admiral; "that's it; go it -- now for it. D--n it, it
is a _do_!"

     The admiral's calmness during the latter part of the dialogue arose 
from
the fact that, over the flunkey's shoulder, and at some little distance off,
he saw Jack Pringle taking off his jacket, and rolling up his sleeves in 
that
deliberate sort of way that seemed to imply a determination of setting about
some species of work that combined the pleasant with the useful.

     Jack executed many nods to and winks at the livery-servant, and jerked
his thumb likewise in the direction of a pump near at hand, in a manner that
spoke as plainly as possible, that John was to be pumped upon.

     And now the conference was ended, and Sir Francis's messenger turned to
go; but Jack Pringle bothered him completely, for he danced round him in 
such
a singular manner, that, turn which way he would, there stood Jack Pringle, 
in
some grotesque attitude, intercepting him; and so he edged him on, till he 
got
him to the pump.

     "Jack," said the admiral.

     "Ay, ay, sir."

     "Don't pump on that fellow now."

     "Ay, ay, sir; give us a hand."

     Jack laid hold of him by the two ears, and holding him under the pump,
kicked his shins until he completely gathered himself beneath the spout.  It
was in vain that he shouted, "Murder! help! fire! thieves!"  Jack was
inexorable and the admiral pumped.

     Jack turned the fellow's head about in a very scientific manner, so as 
to
give him a fair dose of hydropathic treatment, and in a few minutes, never 
was
human being more thoroughly saturated with moisture than was Sir Francis
Varney's servant. He had left off hallooing for aid, for he found that
whenever he did so, Jack held his mouth under the spout, which was decidedly
unpleasant; so, with a patience that looked like heroic fortitude, he was
compelled to wait until the admiral was tired of pumping.

     "Very good," at length he said.  "Now, Jack, for fear this fellow 
catches
cold, be so good as to get a horsewhip, and see him off the premises with 
it."

     "Ay, ay, sir," said Jack.  "And I say, old fellow, you can take back 
all
our blessed compliments now, and say you've been flurried a little yourself;
and if so be as you came here as dry as dust, d---e, you go back as wet as a
mop.  Won't it do to kick him out, sir?"

     "Very well -- as you please, Jack."

     "Then here goes;" and Jack proceeded to kick the shivering animal from
the garden with a vehemence that soon convinced him of the necessity of
getting out of it as quickly as possible.

     How it was that Sir Francis Varney, after that fearful race he had had,
got home again across the fields, free from all danger, and back to his own
house, from whence he sent so cool and insolent a message, they could not
conceive.

     But such must certainly be the fact; somehow or another, he had escaped
all danger, and, with a calm insolence peculiar to the man, he had no doubt
adopted the present mode of signifying as much to the Bannerworths.

     The insolence of his servant was, no doubt, a matter of pre-arrangement
with that individual, however he might have set about it _con amore_.  As 
for
the termination of the adventure, that, of course, had not been at all
calculated upon; but, like most tools of other people's insolence or 
ambition,
the insolence of the underling had received both his own punishment and his
master's.

     We know quite enough of Sir Francis Varney to feel assured that he 
would
rather consider it as a good jest than otherwise of his footman, so that 
with
the suffering he endured at the Bannerworths', and the want of sympathy he 
was
likely to find a home, that individual had certainly nothing to congratulate
himself upon but the melancholy reminiscence of his own cleverness.

     But were the mob satisfied with what had occurred in the churchyard? 
They were not, and that night was to witness the perpetration of a 
melancholy
outrage, such as the history of the time presents no parallel to.

     The finding of a brick in the coffin of the butcher, instead of the 
body
of that individual, soon spread as a piece of startling intelligence all 
over
the place; and the obvious deduction that was drawn from the circumstance,
seemed to be that the deceased butcher was unquestionably a vampyre, and out
upon some expedition at the very time when his coffin was searched.

     How he had originally got out of that receptacle for the dead was
certainly a mystery; but the story was none the worse for that.  Indeed, an
ingenious individual found a solution for that part of the business, for, as
he said, nothing was more natural, when anybody died who was capable of
becoming a vampyre, than for other vampyres who knew it to dig him up, and 
lay
him out in the cold beams of the moonlight, until he acquired the same sort 
of
vitality they themselves possessed, and joined their horrible fraternity.

     In lieu of a better explanation -- and, after all, it was no bad one --
this theory was generally received, and, with a shuddering horror, people
asked themselves, if the whole of the churchyard were excavated, how many
coffins would be found tenantless by the dead which had been supposed, by
simpleminded people, to inhabit them.

     The presence, however, of a body of dragoons, towards evening,
effectually prevented any renewed attack upon the sacred precincts of the
churchyard, and it was a strange and startling thing to see that country 
town
under military surveillance, and sentinels posted at its principal 
buildings.

     This measure smothered the vengeance of the crowd, and insured, for a
time, the safety of Sir Francis Varney; for no considerable body of persons
could assemble for the purpose of attacking his house again, without being
followed; so such a step was not attempted.

     It had so happened, however, than on that very day, the funeral of a
young man was to have taken place, who had put up for a time at that same 
inn
where Admiral Bell was first introduced to the reader.  He had become
seriously ill, and, after a few days of indisposition, which had puzzled the
country practitioners, breathed his last.

     He was to have been buried in the village churchyard on the very day of
the riot and confusion incidental to the exhumation of the coffin of the
butcher, probably from that circumstance we may deduce the presence of the
clergyman in canonicals at the period of the riot.

     When it was found that so disorderly a mob possessed the churchyard, 
the
idea of burying the stranger that day was abandoned; but still all would 
have
gone on quietly as regarded him, had it not been for the folly of one of the
chamber-maids at the tavern.

     This woman, with all the love of gossip incidental to her class, had,
from the first, entered so fully into all the particulars concerning 
vampyres,
that she fairly might be considered to be a little deranged on that head.  
Her
imagination had been so worked upon, that she was in an unfit state to think
of anything else, and if ever upon anybody a stern and revolting 
superstition
was calculated to produce dreadful effects, it was upon this woman.

     The town was tolerably quiet; the presence of the soldiery had 
frightened
some and amused others, and no doubt the night would have passed off 
serenely,
had she not suddenly rushed into the streets, and, with bewildered accents 
and
frantic gestures, shouted, --

     "A vampyre -- a vampyre -- a vampyre!"

     These words soon collected a crowd around her, and then, with screaming
accents, which would have been quite enough to convince any reflecting 
person
that she had actually gone distracted upon that point, she cried, --

     "Come into the house -- come into the house -- come into the house!  
Look
upon the dead body, that should have been in its grave; it's fresher now 
than
on the day on which it died, and there's a colour in its cheeks.  A vampyre 
--
a vampyre -- a vampyre!  Heaven save us from a vampyre!"

     The strange, infuriated, maniacal manner in which these words were
uttered, produced an astonishingly exciting effect among the mob.  Several
women screamed, and some few fainted. The torch was laid again to the altar 
of
popular feeling, and the fierce flame of superstition burnt brightly and
fiercely.

     Some twenty or thirty persons, with shouts and exclamations, rushed 
into
the inn, while the woman who had created the disturbance still continued to
rave, tearing her hair, and shrieking at intervals, until she fell exhausted
upon the pavement.

     Soon, from a hundred throats, rose that dreadful cry of "A vampyre -- a
vampyre!"  The alarm was given throughout the whole town; the bugles of the
military sounded; there was a clash of arms -- the shrieks of women; 
although,
the premonitory symptoms of such a riot as was not likely to be quelled
without bloodshed and considerable disaster.

     It is truly astonishing the effect which one weak or vicious-minded
person can produce upon a multitude.

     Here was a woman whose opinion would have been accounted valueless upon
the most common-place subject, and whose word would not have passed for
twopence, setting a whole town by the ears by force of nothing but her sheer
brutal ignorance.

     It is a notorious physiological fact that, after four or five days, or
even a week, the bodies of many persons assume an appearance of freshness,
such as might have been looked for in vain immediately after death.

     It is one of the most insidious processes of that decay which appears 
to
regret its

                  "-------------------- offensive fingers
                  To mar the lines where beauty lingers."

But what did the chamber-maid know of physiology?  Probably, she would have
asked if it was anything good to eat; and so, of course, having her head 
full
of vampyres, she must needs produce so lamentable a scene of confusion, the
results of which we almost sicken at detailing.

 Next Time: The Stake and the Dead Body.




                            Chapter LVIII. [sic]

[This chapter is misnumbered; it is really Chapter XLVIII]

THE STAKE AND THE DEAD BODY.


     The mob seemed from the first to have an impression that, as regarded
the military force, no very serious results would arise from that quarter,
for it was not to be supposed that, on an occasion which could not possibly
arouse any ill blood on the part of the soldiery, or on which they could 
have
the least personal feeling, they would like to get a bad name, which would
stick to them for years to come.

     It was no political riot, on which men might be supposed, in 
consequence 
of differing in opinion, to have their passions inflamed; so that, although 
the call of the civil authorities for military aid had been acceded to, yet 
it was hoped, and, indeed, almost understood by the officers, that their 
operations would be confined more to a demonstration of power, than anything 
else.

     Besides, some of the men had got talking to the townspeople, and had 
heard all about the vampyre story, and not being of the most refined or 
educated class themselves, they felt rather interested than otherwise in the
affair.

     Under these circumstances, then, we are inclined to think, that the 
disorderly mob of that inn had not so wholesome a fear as it was most
certainly intended they should have of the red coats.  Then, again, they 
were
not attacking the churchyard, which in the first case, was the main point in
dispute, and about which the authorities had felt so very sore, inasmuch as
they felt that, if once the common people found out that the sanctity of 
such
places could be outraged which impunity, they would lose their reverence for
the church; that is to say, for the host of persons who live well and get 
fat
in this country by the trade of religion.

     Consequently, this churchyard was the main point of defence, and it was
zealously looked to when it need not have been done so, while the public-
house
where there really reigned mischeief was half unguarded.

     There are always in all communities, whether large or small, a number 
of
persons who really have, or fancy they have, something ot gain by 
disturbance.  These people, of course, care not for what pretext the public 
peace is violated; so long as there is a row, and something like an excuse 
for running into other peoples's houses, they are satisfied.

     To get into a public-house under such circumstances is an unexpected 
treat; and thus, when the mob rushed into the inn with such symptoms of fury
and excitement, there went with the leaders of the disturbance a number of
persons who never thought of getting further than the bar, where they
attacked the spirit-taps with an alacrity which showed how great was their
love for ardent compounds.

     Leaving these persons behind, however, we will follow those who, with a
real superstition, and a furious interest in the affair of the vampyre, made
their way towards the upper chamber, determining to satisfy themselves if
there were truth in the statement so alarmingly made by the woman who had
created such an emotion.

     It is astonishing what people will do in crowds, in comparison with the 
acts that they would be able to commit individually.  There is usually a 
calmness, a sanctity, a sublimity about death, which irresistibly induces a 
respect for its presence, alike from the educated or from the illiterate; 
and 
let the object of the fell-destroyer's presence be whom it may, the very 
consciousness that death has claimed it for its own, invests it with a halo 
of respect, that, in life, the individual could never aspire to probably.

     Let us precede these furious rioters for a few moments, and look upon 
the chamber of the dead-- that chamber, which for a whole week, had been 
looked upon with a kind of shuddering terror-- that chamber which had been 
darkened by having its sources of light closed, as if it were a kind of 
disrespect to the dead to allow the pleasant sunshine to fall upon the faded 
form.

     And every inhabitant of that house, upon ascending and descending its 
intricate and ancient staircases, had walked with a quiet and subdued step 
past that one particular door.

     Even the tones of voice in which they spoke to each other, while they 
knew that that sad remnant of mortality was in the house, was quiet and 
subdued, as if the repose of death was but a mortal sleep, and could be 
broken by rude sounds.

     Ay, even some of these very persons, who now with loud and boisterous 
clamour, had rushed into the place, had visited the house and talked in 
whispers; but then they were alone and men will do in throngs acts which, 
individually, they would shrink from with compunction or cowardice, call it 
which we will.

     The chamber of death is upon the second story of the house.  It is a 
back room, the windows of which command a view of that half garden, half
farm-yard, which we find generally belonging to country inns.

     But now the shutters were closed, with the exception of one small 
opening, that in daylight, would have admitted a straggling ray of light to
fall upon the corpse.  Now, however, that the sombre shades of evening had
wrapped everything in gloom, the room appeared in total darkness, so that 
the
most of those adventurers who had ventured into the place shrunk back until
lights were procured from the lower part of the house, with which to enter
the room.

     A dim oil lamp in a niche sufficiently lighted the staircase, and, by 
friendly aid of its glimmering beams, they had found their way up to the 
landing tolerably well, and had not thought of the necessity of having 
lights
with which to enter the apartments, until they found them in utter darkness.

     These requisites, however, were speedily procured from the kitchen of 
the inn.  Indeed, anything that was wanted was laid hold of without the 
least
word of remark to the people of the place, as if might, from that evening
forthwith, was understood to constitute right, in that town.

     Up to this point no one had taken a very prominent part in the attack 
upon the inn, if attack it could be called; but now, the man whom chance, or
his own nimbleness, made the first of the throng, assumed to himself a sort
of control over his companions, and, turning to them, he said,--

     "Hark ye, my friends; we'll do everything quietly and properly; so I 
think we'd better three or four of us go in at once, arm-in-arm."

     "Psha!" cried one who had just arrived with a light; "it's your 
cowardice that speaks.  I'll go in first; let those follow me who like, and 
those who are afraid may remain where they are."

     He at once dashed into the room, and this immediately broke the spell 
of
fear which was beginning to creep over the others in consequence of the 
timid
suggestion of the man who, up to that moment, had been first and foremost in
the enterprise.

     In an instant the chamber was half filled with persons, four or five of 
whom carried lights; so that, as it was not of very large dimensions, it was
sufficiently illuminated for every object in it to be clearly visible.

     There was the bed, smooth and unruffled, as if waiting for some 
expected
guest; while close by its side a coffin, supported upon tressels, over which
a sheet was partially thrown, contained the sad remains of him who littled
expected in life that, after death, he should be stigmatised as a example of
one of the ghastliest superstitions that ever found a home in the human
imagination.

     It was evident that some one had been in the room; and that this was 
the
woman whose exiced fancy had led her to look upon the face of the corpse 
there could be no doubt, for the sheet was drawn aside just sufficiently to 
discover the countenance.

     The fact was that the stranger was unknown at the inn, or probably ere 
this the coffin lid would have been screwed on; but it was hoped, up to the 
last moment, as advertisements had been put into the county papers, that 
some 
one would come forward to identify and claim him.

     Such, however, had not been the case, and so his funeral had been 
determined upon.

     The presence of so many persons at once effectually prevented any 
individual from exhibiting, even if he felt, any superstitious fears about 
approaching the coffin; and so, with one accord, they surrounded it, and 
looked upon the face of the dead.

     There was nothing repulsive in that countenance.  The fact was that 
decomposition had sufficiently advanced to induce a relaxation of the 
muscles,
and a softening of the fibres, so that an appearance of calmness and repose
had crept over the face which it did not wear immediately after death.

     It happened, too, that the face was full of flesh; for the death had 
been
sudden, and there had not been that wasting away of the muscles and
integuments which makes the skin cling, as it were, to the bone, when the
ravages of long disease have exhausted the physical frame.

     There was, unquestionably, a plumpness, a freshness, and a sort of 
vitality about the countenance that was remarkable.

     For a few moments there was a deathlike stillness in the apartment, and
then one voice broke the silence by exclaiming,--

     "He's a vampyre, and has come here to die.  Well he knows he'd be taken 
up by Sir Francis Varney, and become one of the crew."

     "Yes, yes," cried several voices at once; "a vampyre! a vampyre!"

     "Hold a moment," cried one; "let us find somebody in the house who has 
seen him some days ago, and then we can ascertain if there's any difference 
in his looks."

     This suggestion was agreed to, and a couple of stout men ran down 
stairs, and returned in a few moments with a trembling waiter, whom they had 
caught in the passage, and forced to accompany them.

     This man seemed to think that he was to be made a dreadful example of 
some sort of way; and, as he was dragged into the room, he trembled, and 
looked as pale as death.

     "What have I done, gentlemen?" he said; "I ain't a vampyre.  Don't be 
driving a stake through me.  I assure you, gentlemen, I'm only a waiter, and
have been for a matter of five-and-twenty years."

     "You'll be done no harm to," said one of his captors; "you've only got 
to answer a question that will be put to you."

     "Oh, well, certainly, gentlemen; anything you please.  Coming--coming, 
as I always say; give your orders, the waiter's in the room."

     "Look upon the face of that corpse."

     "Certainly, certainly--directly."

     "Have you ever seen it before?"

     "Seen it before!  Lord bless you! yes, a dozen of times.  I seed him 
afore he died, and I seed him after; and when the undertaker's men came, I 
came up with them and I seed 'em up put him in his coffin.  You see I kept 
an
eye on 'em gentlemen, 'cos I knows well enough what they is.  A cousin of 
mine was in the trade, and he assures me as one of 'em always brings a
tooth-drawing concern in his pocket, and looks in the mouth of the blessed
corpse to see if there's a blessed tooth worth pulling out."

     "Hold your tongue," said one; "we want none of your nonsense.  Do you
see any difference now in the face of the corpse to what it was some days
since?"

     "Well, I don't know; somehow, it don't look so rum"

     "Does it look fresher?"

     "Well, somehow or another, now you mention it, it's very odd, but it
does.

     "Enough," cried the man who had questioned him, with considerable
excitement of manner.  Neighbours, are we to have our wives and our children
scared to death by vampyres?"

     "No--no!" cried everybody.

     "Is not this, then, one of that dreadful order of beings?"

     "Yes--yes; what's to be done?"

     "Drive a stake through the body, and so prevent the possibility of
anything in the shape of a restoration."

     This was a terrific proposition; and even those who felt most strongly
upon the subject, and had their fears most awakened, shrank form carrying it
into effect.  Others, again, applauded it, although they determined, in 
their
own minds, to keep far enough off from the execution of the job, which they
hoped would devolve upon others, so that they might have all the security of
feeling that such a process had been gone through with the supposed vampyre,
without being in any way committed by the dreadful act.

     Nothing was easier than to procure a stake from the garden in the rear
of the premises; but it was one thing to have the means at hand of carrying 
into effect so dreadful a proposition, and another actually to do it.

     For the credit of human nature, we regret that even then, when
civilisation and popular education had by no means made such rapid strides 
as
in our times they have, such a proposition should be entertained for a
moment; but so it was; and just as an alarm was given that a party of the
soldiery had reached the inn, and had taken possession of the doorway with a
determination to arrest the rioters, a strong hedgestake had been procured,
and everything was in readiness for the perpetration of the horrible deed.

     Even then those in the room, for they were tolerably sober, would have
revolted, probably, from the execution of so fearful an act; but the 
entrance
of a party of military into the lower portion of the tavern, induced those
who had been making free with the strong liquors below, to make a rush
up-stairs to their companions with the hope of escaping detection of the 
petty
larceny, if they got into trouble on account of the riot.

     These persons, infuriated by drink, were capable of anything, and to
them, accordingly, the more sober parties gladly surrendered the  
disagreeable
job of rendering the supposed vampyre perfectly innoxious, by driving a
hedge-stake through his body-- a proceeding which, it was currently 
believed,
inflicted so much physical injury to the frame, as to render his 
resuscitation
out of the question.

     The cries of alarm from below, joined now to the shouts of those mad
rioters, produced a scene of dreadful confusion.

     We cannot, for we revolt at the office, describe particularly the
dreadful outrage which was committed upon the corpse; suffice it that two or
three, maddened by drink, and incited by others, plunged the hedge-stake
through the body, and there left it, a sickening and a horrible spectacle to
any one who might cast his eyes upon it.

     With such violence had the frightful and inhuman deed been committed,
that the bottom of the coffin was perforated by the stake, so that the 
corpse
was actually nailed to its last earthly tenement.

     Some asserted, that at that moment an audible groan came from the dead
man, and that this arose from the extinguishment of that remnant of life
which remained in him, on account of his being a vampyre, and which would
have been brought into full existence, if the body had been placed in the
rays of the moon, when at its full, according to the popular superstition
upon that subject.

     Others, again, were quite ready to swear, that at the moment the stake
was used, there was a visible convulsion of all the limbs, and that the
countenance, before so placid and so clam, became immediately distorted, as
if with agony.

     But we have done with these horrible surmises; the dreadful deed has
been committed, and wild, ungovernable superstition has had, for a time, its
sway over the ignorant and debased.

 Next Time: The Mob's Arrival at Sir Francic Varney's. -- The Attempt to 
Gain
 Admission.




                                Chapter XLIX.

THE MOB'S ARRIVAL AT SIR FRANCIS VARNEY'S. -- THE ATTEMPT TO GAIN ADMISSION.


     The soldiery had been sent for from their principal station near the
churchyard, and had advanced with some degree of reluctance to quell what 
they
considered as nothing better nor worse than a drunken brawl at a public-
house,
which they really considered they ought not to be called to interfere with.

     When, however, the party reached the spot, and heard what a confusion
there was, and saw in what numbers the rioters were assembling, it became
evident to them that the case was of a more serious complexion than they had
at first imagined, and consequently they felt that their professional 
dignity
was not so much compromised with their interference with the lawless
proceedings.

     Some of the constabulary of the town were there, and to them the 
soldiers
promised they would hand what prisoners they took, at the same time that 
they
made a distinct condition that they were not be be troubled with their
custody, nor in any way further annoyed in the business beyond taking care
that they did not absolutely escape, after being once secured.

     This was all that the civil authorities of the town required, and, in
fact, they hoped that, after making prisoners of a few of the ringleaders of
the riotous proceedings, the rest would disperse, and prevent the necessity 
of
capturing them.

     Be it known, however, that both military and civil authorities were
completely ignorant of the dreadful outrage against all common decency, 
which
had been committed within the public- house.

     The door was well guarded, and the question now was how the rioters 
were
to be made to come down stairs, and be captured; and this was likely to 
remain
a question, so long as no means were adopted to make them descend.  So that,
after a time, it was agreed that a couple of troopers would march up stairs
with a constable, to enable him to secure any one who seemed a principal in
the riot.

     But this only had the effect of driving those who were in the second-
floor, and saw the approach of the two soldiers, whom they thought were 
backed
by the whole of their comrades, up a narrow staircase, to a third-floor,
rather consisting of lofts than of actual rooms; but still, for the time, it
was a refuge; and owning to the extreme narrowness of the approach to it,
which consisted of nearly a perpendicular staircase, with any degree of tact
or method, it might have been admirably defended.

     In the hurry and scramble, all the lights were left behind; and when 
the
two soldiers and constables entered the room where the corpse had lain, they
became, for the first time, aware of what a horrible purpose had been 
carried
out by the infuriated mob.

     The sight was one of perfect horror, and hardened to scenes which might
strike other people as being somewhat of the terrific as these soldiers 
might
be supposed to be by their very profession, they actually sickened at the
sight which the mutilated corpse presented, and turned aside with horror.

     These feelings soon gave way to anger and animosity against the crowd 
who
could be guilty of such an atrocious outrage; and, for the first time, a
strong and interested vengeance against the mob pervaded the breasts of 
those
who were brought to act against it.

     One of the soldiers ran down stairs to the door, and reported the scene
which was to be seen above.  A determination was instantly come to, to 
capture
as many as possible of those who had been concerned in so diabolical an
outrage, and leaving a guard of five men at the door, and remainder of the
party ascended the staircase, determined upon storming the last refuge of 
the
rioters, and dragging them to justice.

     The report, however, of these proceedings that were taking place at the
inn, spread quickly over the whole town; and soon as large a mob of the
disorderly and the idle as the place could at all afford was assembled 
outside
the inn.

     This mob appeared appeared, for a time, inertly to watch the 
proceedings.
It seemed rather a hazardous thing to interfere with the soldiers, whose
carbines look formidable and troublesome weapons.

     With true mob courage, therefore, they left the minority of their
comrades, who were within the house, to their fate; and after a whispered
conference from one to the other, they suddenly turned in a body, and began 
to
make for the outskirts of the town.

     They then separated, as if by common consent, and straggled out into 
the
open country by twos and threes, consolidating again into a mass when they 
had
got some distance off, and clear of any exertions that could be made by the
soldiery to stay them.

     The cry then rose of "Down with Sir Francis Varney -- slay him -- burn
his house -- death to all vampyres!" and, at a rapid pace, they proceeded in
the direction of his mansion.

     We will leave this mob, however, for the present, and turn our 
attention
to those who are at the inn, and are certainly in a position of some 
jeopardy.
Their numbers were not great, and they were unarmed; certainly, their best
chance would have been to have surrendered at discretion; but that was a
measure which, if the sober ones had felt inclined to, those who were
infuriated and half maddened with drink would not have acceded to on any
account.

     A furious resistance was, therefore, fairly to be expected; and what
means the soldiery were likely to use for the purpose of storming this last
retreat was a matter of rather anxious conjecture.

     In the case of a regular enemy, there would not, perhaps, have been 
much
difficulty; but here the capture of certain persons, and not their
destruction, was the object; and how that was to be accomplished by fair
means, certainly was a question which nobody felt very competent to solve.

     Determination, however, will do wonders; and although the rioters
numbered over forty, notwithstanding all their desertions, and not above
seventeen or eighteen soldiers marched into the inn, we shall perceive that
they succeeded in accomplishing their object without any manoeuvering at 
all.

     The space in which the rioters were confined was low, narrow, and
inconvenient, as well as dark, for the lights on the staircase cast up that
height but very insufficient rays.

     Weapons of defence they found but very few, and yet there were some
which, to do them but common credit, they used as effectually as possible.

     These attics, or lofts, were used as lumber-rooms, and had been so for
years, so that there was a collection of old boxes, broken pieces of
furniture, and other matters, which will, in defiance of everything and
everybody, collect in a house.

     These were formidable means of defence, if not of offence, down a very
narrow staircase, had they been used with judgment.

     Some of the rioters, who were only just drunk enough to be fool-hardy,
collected a few of these articles at the top of the staircase, and swore 
they
would smash anybody who should attempt to come up to them, a threat easier
uttered than executed.

     And besides, after all, if their position had ever been so impregnable,
they must come down eventually, or be starved out.

     But the soldiers were not at liberty to adopt so slow a process of
overcoming their enemy, and up the second-floor staircase they went, with a
determination of making short work of the business.

     They paused a moment, by word of command, on the landing, and then, 
after
this slight pause, the word was given to advance.

     Now when men will advance, in spite of anything and everything, it is 
no
easy matter to stop them, and he who was foremost among the military would 
as
soon thought of hesitation to ascend the narrow staircase before him, when
ordered so to do, as paying the national debt.  On he went, and down came a
great chest, which, falling against his feet, knocked him down as he 
attempted
to scramble over it.

     "Fire," said the officer; and it appeared that he had made some
arrangements as to how the order was to be obeyed, for the second man fired
his carbine, and then scrambled over his prostrate comrade; after which he
stooped, and the third fired his carbine likewise, and then hurried forward 
in
the same manner.

     At the first sound of the fire arms the rioters were taken completely 
by
surprise; they had not had the least notion of affairs getting to such a
length.  The smell of the powder, the loud report, and the sensation of
positive danger that accompanied these phenomena, alarmed them most
terrifically; so that, in point of fact, with the exception of the empty 
chest
that was thrown down in the way of the first soldier, no further idea of
defence seemed in any way to find a place in the hearts of the besieged.

     They scrambled one over the other in their eagerness to get as far as
possible from immediate danger, which, of course, they conceived existed in
the most imminent degree the nearest to the door.

     Such was the state of terror into which they were thrown, that each one
at the moment believed himself shot, and the soldiers had overcome all the
real difficulties in getting possession of what might thus be called the
citadel of the inn, before those men who had been so valorous a short time
since recovered from the tremendous fright into which they had been thrown.

     We need hardly say that the carbines were loaded, but with blank
cartridges, for there was neither a disposition nor a necessity for taking 
the
lives of these misguided people.

     It was the suddenness and the steadiness of the attack that had done 
all
the mischief to their cause; but now, ere they recovered from the surprise 
of
having their position so completely taken by storm, they were handed down
stairs, one by one, from soldier to soldier, and into the custody of the 
civil
authorities.

     In order to secure the safe keeping of so large a body of prisoners, 
the
constables, who were in a great minority, placed handcuffs upon some of the
most capable of the resistance; so what with those who were thus secured, 
and
those who were terrified into submission, there was not a man of all the lot
who had taken refuge in the attics of the public-house but was a prisoner.

     At the sound of fire-arms, the women who were outside the inn had, of
course, raised a prodigious clamour.

     They believed directly that every bullet must have done some serious
mischief to the townspeople, and it was only upon one of the soldiers, a
non-commissioned officer, who was below, assuring them of the innoxious 
nature
of the proceeding which restored anything like equanimity.

     "Silence!" he cried; "what are you howling about?  Do you fancy that
we've nothing better to do than to shoot a parcel of fellows that are not
worth the bullets that would be lodged in their confounded carcases?"

     "But we heard the gun," said a woman.

     "Of course you did; it's the powder that makes the noise, not the 
bullet.
You'll see them all brought out safe wind and limb."

     This assurance satisfied the women to a certain extent, and such had 
been
their fear that they should have had to look upon the spectacle of death, or
of grevious wounds, that they were comparatively quite satisfied when they 
saw
husbands, fathers, and brothers, only in the custody of the town officers.

     And very sheepish some of the fellows looked, when they were handed 
down
and handcuffed, and the more especially when they had been routed only by a
few blank cartridges -- that sixpennyworth of powder had defeated them.

     They were marched off to the town gaol, guarded by the military, who 
now
probably fancied that their night's work was over, and that the most 
turbulent
and troublesome spirits in the town had been secured.

     Such, however, was not the case, for no sooner had comparative order 
been
restored, than common observation pointed to a dull red glare in the 
southern
sky.

     In a few more minutes there came in stragglers from the open country,
shouting "Fire! fire!" with all their might.

 Next Time: The Mob's Arrival at Sir Francis Varney's. -- The Attempt to 
Gain
 Admission.




                                 Chapter L.

THE MOB'S ARRIVAL AT SIR FRANCIS VARNEY'S. -- THE ATTEMPT TO GAIN ADMISSION.


     All eyes were directed towards that southern sky which each moment was
becoming more and more illuminated by the lurid appearance bespeaking a
conflagration, which, if it was not extensive, at all events was raging
fiercely.

     There came, too upon the wind, which set from that direction, strange
sounds, resembling shouts of triumph, combined occasionally with sharper
cries, indicative of alarm.

     With so much system and so quietly had this attack been made upon the
house of Sir Francis Varney -- for the consequences of it now exhibited
themselves more unequivocally -- that no one who had not actually 
accompanied
the expedition was in the least aware that it had been at all undertaken, or
that anything of the kind was on the tapis.

     Now, however, it could be no longer kept a secret, and as the 
infuriated
mob, who had sought this flagrant means of giving vent to their anger, saw 
the
flames from the blazing house rising high in the heavens, they felt 
convinced
that further secresy was out of the question.

     Accordingly, in such cries and shouts as -- but for caution's sake --
they would have indulged in from the very first, they now gave utterance to
their feelings as regarded the man whose destruction was aimed at.

     "Death to the vampyre! -- death to the vampyre!" was the principal 
shout,
and it was uttered in tones which sounded like those of rage and
disappointment.

     But it is necessary, now that we have disposed of the smaller number of
rioters who committed so serious an outrage at the inn, that we should, with
some degree of method, follow the proceedings of the larger number, who went
from the town towards Sir Francis Varney's.

     These persons either had information of a very positive nature, or a 
very
strong suspicion that, notwithstanding the mysterious and most unaccountable
disappearance of the vampyre in the old ruin, he would now be found, as 
usual,
at his own residence.

     Perhaps one of his own servants may have thus played the traitor to 
him;
but, however it was, there certainly was an air of confidence about some of
the leaders of the tumultous assemblage that induced a general belief that
this time, at least, the vampyre would not escape popular vengeance for 
being
what he was.

     We have before noticed that these people went out of the town at
different points, and did not assemble into one mass until they were at a
sufficient distance off to be free from all fear of observation.

     Then some of the less observant and cautious of them began to indulge 
in
shouts of rage and defiance; but those who placed themselves foremost
succeeded in procuring a halt, and one said, --

     "Good friends all, if we make any noise, it can only have one effect, 
and
that is, to warn Sir Francis Varney, and enable him to escape.  If, 
therefore,
we cannot go on quietly, I propose that we return to our homes, for we shall
accomplish nothing."

     This advice was sufficiently and evidently reasonable to meet with no
dissension; a death-like stillness ensued, only broken by some two or three
voices saying, in subdued tones, --

     "That's right -- that's right.  Nobody speak."

     "Come on, then," said he who had given such judicious counsel; and the
dark mass of men moved towards Sir Francis Varney's house, as quietly as it
was possible for such an assemblage to proceed.

     Indeed, saving the sound of the footsteps, nothing could be heard of 
them
at all; and that regular tramp, tramp, tramp, would have puzzled any one
listening to it from any distance to know in which direction it was
proceeding.

     In this way they went on until Sir Francis Varney's house was reached,
and even then a whispered word to halt was given, and all eyes were bent 
upon
the building.

     From but one window out of the numerous ones with which the front of 
the
mansion was studded did there shine the least light, and from that there 
came
rather an uncommonly bright reflection, probably arising from a reading lamp
placed close to the window.

     A general impression, they knew not why exactly, seemed to pervade
everybody, that in the room from whence streamed that bright light was Sir
Francis Varney.

     "The vampyre's room!" said several.  "The vampyre's room! That is it!"

     "Yes," said he who had a kind of moral control over his comrades; "I 
have
no doubt but he is there."

     "What's to be done?" asked several.

     "Make no noise whatever, but stand aside, so as not to be seen from the
door when it is opened."

     "Yes, yes."

     "I will knock for admittance, and, the moment it is answered, I will
place this stick in such a manner within, that the door cannot be closed
again.  Upon my saying 'Advance,' you will make a rush forward, and we shall
have possession immediately of the house."

     All this was agreed to.  The mob shrunk close to the walls of the 
house,
and out of immediate observation from the hall door, or from any of the
windows, and then the leader advanced, and knocked loudly for admission.

     The silence was now of the most complete character that could be
imagined.  Those who came there so bent upon vengeance were thoroughly
convinced of the necessity of extreme caution, to save themselves even yet
from being completely foiled.

     They had abundant faith, from experience, of the resources in the way 
of
escape of Sir Francis Varney, and not one among them was there who 
considered
that there was any chance of capturing him, except by surprise; and when 
once
they got hold of him, they determined he should not easily slip through 
their
fingers.

     The knock for admission produced no effect; and, after waiting three or
four minutes, it was very provoking to find such a wonderful amount of 
caution
and cunning completely thrown away.

     "Try again," whispered one.

     "Well, have patience; I am going to try again."

     The man had the ponderous old-fashioned knocker in his hand, and was
about to make another appeal to Sir Francis Varney's door, when a strange
voice said, --

     "Perhaps you may as well say at once what you want, instead of knocking
there to no purpose."

     He gave a start, for the voice seemed to come from the very door 
itself.

     Yet it sounded decidedly human; and, upon a closer inspection, it was
seen that a little wicket-gate, not larger than a man's face, had been 
opened
from within.

     This was terribly provoking.  Here was an extent of caution on the part
of the garrison quite unexpected.  What was to be done?

     "Well?" said the man who appeared at the little opening.

     "Oh," said he who had knocked; "I -- "

     "Well?"

     "I -- that is to say -- ahem!  Is Sir Francis Varney within?"

     "Well?"

     "I say, is Sir Francis Varney within?"

     "Well; you have said it!"

     "Ah, but you have not answered it."

     "No."

     "Well, is he at home?"

     "I decline saying; so you had better, all of you, go back to the town
again, for we are well provided with all material to resist any attack you 
may
be fools enough to make."

     As he spoke, the servant shut the little square door with a bang that
made his questioner jump again.  Here was a dilemma!

 Next Time: The Attack Upon the Vampyre's House. -- The Fury of the Attack. 
--
 The Forcing of the Doors, and the Struggle.




                                 Chapter LI.

THE ATTACK UPON THE VAMPYRE'S HOUSE. -- THE FURY OF THE ATTACK. -- THE 
FORCING
OF THE DOORS, AND THE STRUGGLE.


     A council of war was now called among the belligerents, who were 
somewhat
taken aback by the steady refusal of the servant to admit them and their
apparent determination to resist all endeavours on the part of the mob to 
get
into and obtain possession of the house.  It argued that they were prepared 
to
resist all attempts, and it would cost some few lives to get into the
vampyre's house.  This passed through the minds of many as they retired 
behind
the angle of the wall where the council was to be held.

     Here they looked in each others' faces as if to gather from that the
general tone of the feelings of their companions; but here they saw nothing
that intimated the least idea of going back as they came.

     "It's all very well, mates, to take care of ourselves, you know," began
one tall, brawny fellow; "but, if we bean't to be sucked to death by a
vampyre, why we must have the life out of him."

     "Ay, so we must."

     "Jack Hodge is right; we must kill him, and there's no sin in it, for 
he
has no right to it; he's robbed some poor fellow of his life to prolong his
own."

     "Ay, ay, that's the way he does; bring him out, I say, then see what we
will do with him."

     "Yes, catch him first," said one, "and then we can dispose of him
afterwards.  I say, neighbours, don't you  think it would be as well to 
catch
him first?"

     "Haven't we come on purpose?"

     "Yes, but do it."

     "Ain't we trying it?"

     "You will presently, when we come to get into the house."

     "Well, what's to be done?" said one; "here we are in a fix, I think, 
and
I can't see our way out very clearly."

     "I wish we could get in."

     "But how is a question I don't very well see," said a large specimen of
humanity.

     "The best thing that can be done will be to go round and look over the
whole house, and then we may come upon some part where it is far easier to 
get
in at than by the front door."

     "But it won't do for us all to go round that way," said one; "a small
party only should go, else they will have all their people stationed at one
point, and if we can divide them, we shall beat them because they have not
enough to defend more than one point at a time; now we are numerous enough 
to
make several attacks."

     "Oh! that's the way to bother them all round; they'll give in, and then
the place is our own."

     "No, no," said the big countryman, "I like to make a good rush and 
drive
all afore us; you know what ye have to do then, and you do it, ye know."

     "If you can."

     "Ay, to be sure, if we can, as you say; but can't we? that's what I 
want
to know."

     "To be sure we can."

     "Then we'll do it, mate -- that's my mind; we'll do it. Come one, and
let's have another look at the street-door."

     The big countryman left the main body, and resolutely walked up to the
main avenue, and approached the door, accompanied by about a dozen or less 
of
the mob.  When they came to the door, they commenced knocking and kicking 
most
violently, and assailing it with all kinds of things they could lay their
hands upon.

     They continued at this violent exercise for some time -- perhaps for 
five
minutes, when the little square hole in the door was again opened, and a 
voice
was heard to say, --

     "You had better cease that kind of annoyance."

     "We want to get in."

     "It will cost you more lives to do so than you can afford to spare.  We
are well armed, and are prepared to resist any effort you can make."

     "Oh! it's all very well; but, an you won't open, why we'll make you;
that's all about it."

     This was said as the big countryman and his companions were leaving the
avenue towards the rest of the body.

     "Then, takes this, as an earnest of what is to follow," said the man, 
and
he discharged the contents of a blunderbuss through the small opening, and 
its
report sounded to the rest of the mob like the report of a field-piece.

     Fortunately for the party retiring the man couldn't take any aim, else 
it
is questionable how many of the party would have got off unwounded.  As it
was, several of them found stray slugs were lodged in various parts of their
persons, and accelerated their retreat from the house of the vampyre.

     "What luck?" inquired one of the mob to the others, as they came back;
"I'm afraid you had all the honour."

     "Ay, ay, we have, and all the lead too," replied a man, as he placed 
his
hand upon a sore part of his person, which bled in consequence of a wound.

     "Well, what's to be done?"

     "Danged if I know," said one.

     "Give it up," said another.

     "No, no; have him out.  I'll never give in while I can use a stick.  
They
are in earnest and so are we.  Don't let us be frightened because they have 
a
gun or two -- they can't have many; and besides, if they have, we are too 
many
for them. Besides, we shall all die in our beds."

     "Hurrah! down with the vampyre!"

     "So say I, lads.  I don't want to be sucked to death when I'm a-bed. 
Better die like a man than such a dog's death as that, and you have no 
revenge
then."

     "No, no; he has the better of us then.  We'll have him out -- we'll 
burn
him -- that's the way we'll do it."

     "Ay, so we will; only let us get in."

     At that moment a chosen party returned who had been round the house to
make a reconnoissance.

     "Well, well," inquired the mob, "what can be done now -- where can we 
get
in?"

     "In several places."

     "All right; come along then; the place is our own."

     "Stop a minute; they are armed at all points, and we must make an 
attack
on all points, else we may fail.  A party must go round to the front-door, 
and
attempt to beat it in; there are plenty of poles and things that could be 
used
for such a purpose."

     "There is, besides, a garden-door, that opens into the house -- a kind 
of
parlour; a kitchen-door; a window in the flower-garden, and an entrance into 
a
store-room; this place appears strong, and is therefore unguarded."

     "The very point to make an attack."

     "Not quite."

     "Why not?"

     "Because it can easily be defended, and rendered useless to us.  We 
must
make an attack upon all places but that, and, while they are being at those
points, we can then enter at that place, and then you will find them desert
the other places when they see us inside."

     "Hurrah! down with the vampyre!" said the mob, as they listened to this
advice, and appreciated the plan.

     "Down with the vampyre!"

     "Now, then, lads, divide, and make the attack; never mind their guns,
they have but very few, and if you rush in upon them, you will soon have the
guns yourselves."

     "Hurrah! hurrah!" shouted the mob.

     The mob now moved away in different bodies, each strong enough to carry
the house.  They seized upon a variety of poles and stones, and then made 
for
the various doors and windows that were pointed out by those who had made 
the
discovery.  Each one of those who had formed the party of observation, 
formed
a leader to the others, and at once proceeded to the post assigned him.

     The attack was so sudden and so simultaneous that the servants were
unprepared; and though they ran to the doors, and fired away, still they did
but little good, for the doors were soon forced open by the enraged rioters,
who proceeded in a much more systematic operation, using long heavy pieces 
of
timber which were carried on the shoulder of several men, and driving with 
the
force of battering-rams -- which, in fact, they were -- against the door.

     Bang went the battering-ram, crash went the door, and the whole party
rushed headlong in, carried forward by their own momentum and fell 
prostrate,
engine and all, into the passage.

     "Now, then, we have them," exclaimed the servants, who began to 
belabour
the whole party with blows, with every weapon they could secure.

     Loudly did the fallen men shout for assistance, and but for their 
fellows
who came rushing in behind, they would have had but a sorry time of it.

     "Hurrah!" shouted the mob; "the house is our own."

     "Not yet," shouted the servants.

     "We'll try," said the mob; and they rushed forward to drive the 
servants
back, and they met with a stout resistance, and as some of them had choppers
and swords, there were a few wounds given, and presently bang went the
blunderbuss.

     Two or three of the mob reeled and fell.

     This produced a momentary panic, and the servants then had the whole of
the victory to themselves, and were about to charge, and clear the passage 
of
their enemies, when a shout behind attracted their attention.

     That shout was caused by an entrance being gained in another quarter,
whence the servants were flying, and all was disorder.

     "Hurrah! hurrah!" shouted the mob.

     The servants retreated to the stairs, and here united, they made a 
stand,
and resolved to resist the whole force of the rioters, and they succeeded in
doing so, too, for some minutes. Blows were given and taken of a desperate
character.

     Somehow, there were no deadly blows received by the servants; there 
were
being forced and beaten, but they lost no life; this may be accounted for by
the fact that the mob used no more deadly weapons than sticks.

     The servants of Sir Francis Varney, on the contrary, were mostly armed
with deadly weapons, which, however, they did not used unnecessarily.

     They stood upon the hall steps -- the grand staircase, with long poles 
or
sticks, about the size of quarter-staves, and with these they belaboured 
those
below most unmercifully.

     Certainly, the mob were by no means cowards, for the struggle to close
with their enemies was as great as ever, and as firm as could well be. 
Indeed, they rushed on with a desperation truly characteristic of John Bull,
and defied the heaviest blows; for as fast as one was stricken down another
occupied his place, and they insensibly pressed their close and compact 
front
upon the servants, who were becoming fatigued and harassed.

     "Fire, again," exclaimed a voice from among the servants.

     The mob made no retrograde movement, but still continued to press
onwards, and in another moment a loud report rang through the house, and a
smoke hung over the heads of the mob.

     A long groan or two escaped some of the men who had been wounded, and a
still louder from those who had not been wounded, and a cry arose of, --

     "Down with the vampyre -- pull down -- destroy and burn the whole place
-- down with them all."

     A rush succeeded, and a few more discharges took place, when a shout
above attracted the attention of both parties engaged in this fierce 
struggle.
They paused by mutual consent, to look and see what was the cause of that
shout.

 Next Time: The Interview Between the Mob and Sir Francis Varney. -- The
 Mysterious Disappearance. -- The Wine Cellar.




                                 Chapter LII.

THE INTERVIEW BETWEEN THE MOB AND SIR FRNCIS VARNEY. -- THE MYSTERIOUS
DISAPPEARANCE. -- THE WINE CELLARS.


     The shout that had so discomposed the parties who were thus engaged in
a terrific struggle came from a party above.

     "Hurrah! hurrah!" they shouted a number of times, in a wild strain of
delight.  "Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!"

     The fact was, a party of the mob had clambered up a verandah, and 
entered
some of the rooms upstairs, whence they emerged just above the landing near
the spot where the servants were resisting in a mass the efforts of the mob.

     "Hurrah!" shouted the mob below.
     
     "Hurrah!" shouted the mob above.

     There was a momentary pause, and the servants divided themselves into
two bodies, and one turned to face those above, and the other those who were
below.

     A simultaneous shout was given by both parties of the mob, and a sudden
rush was made by both bodies, and the servants of Sir Francis Varney were
broken in an instant.  They were instantly separated, and knocked about a
good bit, but they were left to shift for themselves, the mob had a more
important object in view.

     "Down with the vampyre!" they shouted.

     "Down with the vampyre!" shouted they, and they rushed helter skelter
through the rooms, until they came to one where the door was partially open,
and they could see some person very leisurely seated.

     "Here he is," they cried.

     "Who? who?"

     "The vampire."

     "Down with him! kill him! burn him!"

     "Hurrah! down with the vampire!"

     These sounds were shouted out by a score of voices, and they rushed
headlong into the room.

     But here their violence and headlong precipitancy were suddenly
restrained by the imposing and quiet appearance of the individual who was
there seated.

     The mob entered the room, and there was a sight, that if it did not
astonish them, at least, it caused them to pause before the individual who
was seated there.

     The room was filled with furniture, and there was a curtain drawn 
across
the room, and about the middle of it there was a table, behind which sat Sir
Francis Varney himself, looking all smiles and courtesy.

     "Well, dang my smock-frock!" said one, "who'd ha' thought of this?  He
don't seem to care much about it."

     "Well, I'm d----d!" said another; "he seems pretty easy, at all events.
What is he going to do?"

     "Gentlemen," said Sir Francis Varney, rising, with the blandest of 
smiles, "pray, gentlemen, permit me to inquire the cause of this 
condescension
on your part.  The visit is kind."

     The mob looked at Sir Francis, and then at each other, and then at Sir
Francis again; but nobody spoke.  They were awed by this gentlemanly and
collected behaviour.

     "If you honour me with this visit from pure affection and neighbourly
good-will, I thank you."

     "Down with the vampyre!" said one, who was concealed behind the rest,
and not so much overawed, as he had not seen Sir Francis.

     Sir Francis Varney rose to his full height; a light gleamed across his
features; they were strongly defined then.  His long front teeth, too, 
showed
most strongly when he smiled, as he did now, and said, in a bland voice,--

     "Gentlemen, I am at your service.  Permit me to say you are all welcome
to all I can do for you.  I fear the interview will be somewhat inconvenient
and unpleasant to you.  As for myself, I am entirely at your service."

     As Sir Francis spoke, he bowed, and folded his hands together, and
stepped forwards; but, instead of coming onwards to them, he walked behind
the curtain, and was immediately hid from their view.

     "Down with the vampyre!" shouted one.

     "Down with the vampyre!" rang through the apartment; and the mob now,
not awed by the coolness and courtesy of Sir Francis, rushed forward, and,
overturning the table, tore down the curtain to the floor; but, to their
amazement, there was no Sir Francis Varney present.

     "Where is he?"

     "Where is the vampyre?"

     "Where has he gone?"

     These were cries that escaped every one's lips; and yet no one could
give an answer to them.

     There Sir Francis Varney was not.  They were completely 
thunderstricken.
They could not find out where he had gone to.  There was no possible means 
of
escape, that they could perceive.  There was not an odd corner, or even
anything that could, by any possibility, give even a suspicion that even a
temporary concealment could take place.

     They looked over every inch of flooring and of wainscoting; not the
remotest trace could be discovered.

     "Where is he?"

     "I don't know," said one-- "I can't see where he could have gone.  
There
ain't a hole as big as a keyhole."

     "My eye!" said one; "I shouldn't be at all surprised, if he were to 
blow
up the whole house."

     "You don't say so!"

     "I never heard as how vampyres could do so much as that.  They ain't 
the
sort of people," said another.

     "But if they can do one thing, they can do another."

     "That's very true."

     "And what's more, I never heard as how a vampyre could make himself 
into
nothing before; yet he has done so."

     "He may be in this room now."

     "He may."

     "My eyes! what precious long teeth he had!"

     "Yes; and had he fixed one on 'em in to your arm, he would have drawn
every drop of blood out of your body; you may depend upon that," said an old
man.

     "He was very tall."

     "Yes; too tall to be any good."

     "I shouldn't like him to have laid hold of me, though, tall as he is;
and then he would have lifted me up high enough to break my neck, when he 
let
me fall."

     The mob routed about the room, tore everything out of its place, and as
the object of their search seemed to be far enough beyond their reach, their
courage rose in proportion, and they shouted and screamed with a
proportiouate increase of noise and bustle; and at length they ran about mad
with rage and vexation, doing all the mischief that was in their power to
inflict.

     Then they became mischievous, and tore the furniture from its place, 
and
broke it into pieces, and then amused themselves with breaking it up,
throwing pieces at the pierglasses, in which they made dreadful holes; and
when that was gone, they broke up the frames.

     Every hole and corner of the house was searched; but there was no Sir
Francis Varney to be found.

     "The cellars, the cellars!" shouted a voice.

     "The cellars, the cellars!" re-echoed nearly every pair of lips in the
whole place; in another moment, there was crushing and crowding to get down
into the cellars.

     "Hurray!" said one, as he knocked off the neck of the bottle that first
came to hand.  "Here's luck to vampyre-hunting!  Success to our chase!"

     "So say I, neighbour; but is that your manners to drink before your
betters?"

     So saying, the speaker knocked the other's elbow, while he was in the
act of lifting the wine to his mouth; and thus he upset it over his face and
eyes.

     "D--n it!" cried the man; "how it makes my eyes smart!  Dang thee! if I
could see, I'd ring thy neck!"

     "Success to vampyre-hunting!" said one.

     "May we be lucky yet!" said another.

     "I wouldn't be luckier than this," said another, as he, too, emptied a
bottle.  "We couldn't desire better entertainment, where the reckoning is 
all
paid."

     "Excellent!"

     "Very good!"

     "Capital wine this!"

     "I say, Huggins!"

     "Well," said Huggins.

     "What are you drinking?"

     "Wine."

     "What wine?"

     "Danged if I know," was the reply.  "It's wine, I suppose; for I know 
it
ain't beer nor spirits; so it must be wine."

     "Are you sure it ain't bottled men's blood?"

     "Eh?"

     "Bottled blood, man!  Who knows what a vampyre drinks?  It may be his
wine.  He may feast upon that before he goes to bed of a night, drink
anybody's health, and make himself cheerful on bottled blood!"

     "Oh, danged!  I'm so sick; I wish I hadn't taken the stuff.  It may be
as you say, neighbour, and then we be cannibals."

     "Or vampyres."

     "There's a pretty thing to think of."

     By this time some were drunk, some were partially so, and the remainder
were crowding into the cellars to get their share of the wine.

     The servants had now slunk away; they were no longer noticed by the
rioters, who, having nobody to oppose them, no longer thought of anything,
save the searching after the vampyre, and the destruction of the property. 
Several hours had been spent in this manner, and yet they could not find the
object of their search.

     There was not a room, or cupboard, or a cellar, that was capable of
containing a cat, that they did not search, besides a part of the rioters
keeping a very strict watch on the outside of the house and all about the
grounds, to prevent the possibility of the escape of the vampyre.

     There was a general cessation of active hostilities at that moment; a
reaction after the violent excitement and exertion they had made to get in.
Then the escape of their victim, and the mysterious manner in which he got
away, was also a cause of the reaction, and the rioters looked in each
others' countenances inquiringly.

     Above all, the discovery of the winecellar tended to withdraw them from
violent measures; but this could not last long, there must be an end to such
a scene, for there never was a large body of men assembled for an evil
purpose, who ever were, for any length of time, peaceable.

     To prevent the more alarming effects of drunkenness, some few of the
rioters, after having taken some small portion of the wine, became, from the
peculiar flavour it possessed, imbued with the idea that it was really 
blood,
and forthwith commenced an instant attack upon the wine and liquors, and 
they
were soon mingling in one stream throughout the cellars.

     This destruction was loudly declaimed against by a large portion of the
rioters, who were drinking; but before they could make any efforts to save
the liquor, the work of destruction had not only been begun, but was ended,
and the consequence was, the cellars were very soon evacuated by the mob.

THE DESTRUCTION OF SIR FRANCIS VARNEY'S HOUSE BY FIRE. -- THE ARRIVAL OF THE
MILITARY, AND A SECOND MOB.

 
     Thus many moments had not elapsed ere the feelings of the rioters 
became
directed into a different channel from that in which it had so lately 
flowed. 
When urged about the house and grounds for the vampyre, they became 
impatient
and angry at not finding him.  Many believed that he was yet about the 
house,
wile many were of opinion that he had flown away by some mysterious means
only possessed by vampyres and such like people.

     "Fire the house, and burn him out," said one.
 
     "Fire the house!"
 
     "Burn the den!" now arose in shouts from all present, and then the mob
were again animated by the love of mischief that seemed to be the strongest
feelings that animated them.
 
     "Burn him out-- burn him out!" were the only words that could be heard
from any of the mob.  The words ran through the house like wild-fire, nobody
thought of anything else, and all were seen running about in confusion.
 
    There was no want of good will on the part of the mob to the 
undertaking;
far from it, and they proceeded in the work _con amore_.  They worked 
together
ith right good will, and the result was soon seen by the heaps of 
combustible
materials that were collected in a short time from all parts of the house.
 
     All the old dry wood furniture that could be found was piled up in a
heap, and to these were added a number of faggots, and also some shavings 
that
wre found in the cellar.
 
     "All right!" exclaimed one man, in exultation.
 
    "Yes," replied a second; "all right-- all right!  Set light to it, and 
he
will be smoked out if not burned."
 
     "Let us be sure that all are out of the house," suggested one of the
bystanders.
 
     "Ay, ay," shouted several; "give them all a chance.  Search through the
house and give them a warning."
 
     "Very well; give me the light, and then when I come back I will set 
light
to the fire at once, and then I shall know all is empty, and so will you 
too."

     This was at once agreed to by all, with acclamations, and the light 
being
handed to the man, he ascended the stairs, crying out in a loud voice,--
 
     "Come out-- come out! the house is on fire!"
 
     "Fire! fire! fire!" shouted the mob as a chorus, every now and then at
intervals.
 
     In about ten minutes more, there came a cry of " all right; the house 
is
empty," from up the stairs, and the man descended in haste to the hall.
 
     "Make haste, lads, and fire away, for I see the red coats are leaving 
the
town."
 
     "Hurra! hurra!" shouted the infuriated mob.  " Fire-- fire-- fire the
house!  Burn out the vampyre!  Burn down the house-- burn him out, and see 
if
e can stand fire."
 
     Amidst all this tumult there came a sudden blaze upon all around, for 
the
pile had been fired.

     "Hurra!" shouted the mob-- "hurra!" and they danced like maniacs round
the fire; looking, in fact, like so many wild Indians, dancing round their
roasting victims, or some demons at an infernal feast.
 
     The torch had been put to twenty different places, and the flames 
united
into one, and suddenly shot up with a velocity, and roared with a sound that
aused many who were present to make a precipitate retreat from the hall.
 
    This soon became a necessary measure of self-preservation, and it
required no urging to induce them to quit a place that was burning rapidly 
and
ven furiously.
 
     "Get the poles and firewood-- get faggots," shouted some of the mob, 
and,
lo, it was done almost by magic.  They brought the faggots and wood piled up
or winter use, and laid them near all the doors, and especially the main
entrance.  Nay, every gate or door belonging to the outhouses was brought
forward and placed upon the fire, which now began to reach the upper 
stories.
 
     "Hurra-- fire!  Hurra-- fire!"
 
     And a loud shout of triumph came from the mob as they viewed the 
progress
of the flames, as they came roaring and tearing through the house doors and
the windows.
 
     Each new victory of the element was a signal to the mob for a cheer; 
and
a hearty cheer, too, came from them.
 
     "Where is the vampyre now?"  exclaimed one.
 
     "Ha! where is he?" said another.
 
     "If he be there," said the man, pointing to the flames, "I reckon he's
got a warm berth of it, and, at the same time, very little water to boil in
his kettle."
 
     "Ha, ha! what a funny old man is Bob Mason; he's always poking fun; 
he'd
joke if his wife were dying."
 
     "There is many a true word spoken in jest," suggested another; "and, to
my mind, Bob Mason wouldn't be very much grieved if his wife were to die."
 
     "Die?" said Bob; "she and I have lived and quarrelled daily a matter of
five-and-thirty years, and, if that ain't enough to make a man sick of being
married, and of his wife, hang me, that's all.  I say I am tired."

    This was said with much apparent sincerity, and several laughed at the
old man's heartiness.
 
     "It's all very well," said the old man; "it's all very well to laugh
about matters you don't understand, but I know it isn't a joke-- not a bit 
on
it.  I tells you what it is, neighbour, I never made but one grand mistake 
in
all my life."
 
     "And what was that?"
 
     "To tie myself to a woman."
 
     "Why, you'd get married to-morrow if your wife were to die to-day," 
said
one.
 
     "If I did, I hope I may marry a vampyre.  I should have something then 
to
think about.  I should know what's o'clock.  But, as for my old woman, lord,
lord, I wish Sir Francis Varney had had her for life.  I'll warrant when the
next natural term of his existence came round again, he wouldn't be in no
hurry to renew it; if he did, I should say that vampyres had the happy lot 
of
managing women, which I haven't got."
 
     "No, nor anybody else."
 
     A loud shout now attracted their attention, and, upon looking in the
quarter whence it came, they descried a large body of people coming towards
them; from one end of the mob could be seen a long string of red coats.

     "The red coats!" shouted one.
 
     "The military!" shouted another.
 
     It was plain the military who had been placed in the town to quell
disturbances, had been made acquainted with the proceedings at Sir Francis
Varney's house, and were now marching to relieve the place, and to save the
property.
 
     They were, as we have stated, accompanied by a vast concourse of 
people,
who came out to see what they were going to see, and seeing the flames at 
Sir
Fancis Varney's house, they determined to come all the way, and be present.
 
     The military, seeing the disturbance in the distance, and the flames
issuing from the windows, made the best of their way towards the scene of
tumult with what speed they could make.
 
     "Here they come," said one.
 
     "Yes, just in time to see what is done."
 
    "Yes, they can go back and say we have burned the vampyre's house down--
hurra!"
 
     "Hurra!" shouted the mob, in prolonged accents, and it reached the ears
of the military.
 
     The officer urged the men onwards, and they responded to his words, by
exerting themselves to step out a little faster.
 
     "Oh, they should have been here before this; it's no use, now, they are
too late."
 
     "Yes, they are too late."
 
     "I wonder if the vampyre can breathe through the smoke, and live in
fire," said one.

     "I should think he must be able to do so, if he can stand shooting, as 
we
know he can-- you can't kill a vampyre; but yet he must be consumed, if the
fre actually touches him, but not unless he can bear almost anything."

     "So he can."
 
     "Hurra!" shouted the mob, as a tall flame shot through the top windows 
of
the house.
 
     The fire had got the ascendant now, and no hopes could be entertained,
however extravagant, of saving the smallest article that had been left in 
the
ansion.
 
     "Hurra!" shouted the mob with the military, who came up with them.
 
    "Hurra!" shouted the others in reply.
 
     "Quick march!" said the officer; and then, in a loud, commanding tone, 
he
shouted, "Clear the way, there! clear the way."

    "Ay, there's room enough for you," said the old Mason; "what are you
making so much noise about?"
 
     There was a general laugh at the officer, who took no notice of the
words, but ordered his men up before the burning pile, which was now an
immense mass of flame.

     The mob who had accompanied the military now mingled with the mob that
had set the house of Sir Francis Varney on fire ere the military had come up
ith them.
 
     "Halt!" cried out the officer; and the men, obedient to the word of
command, halted, and drew up in a double line before the house.
 
     There were then some words of command issued, and some more given to 
some
of the subalterns, and a party of men, under the command of a sergeant, was
sent off from the main body, to make a circuit of the house and grounds.
 
     The officer gazed for some moments upon the burning pile without
speaking; and then, turning to the next in command, he said in low tones, as
h looked upon the mob,--
 
     "We have come too late."
 
     "Yes, much."
 
     "The house is now nearly gutted."
 
     "It is."
 
     "And those who came crowding along with us are inextricably mingled 
with
the others who have been the cause of all this mischief; there's no
distinguishing them one from another."
 
     "And if you did, you could not say who had done it, and who had not; 
you
could prove nothing."
 
     "Exactly."
 
     "I shall not attempt to take prisoners, unless any act is perpetrated
beyond what has been done."
 
     "It is a singular affair."
 
     "Very."
 
     "This Sir Francis Varney is represented to be a courteous, gentlemanly
man," said the officer.
 
     "No doubt about it, but he's beset by a parcel of people who do not 
mind
cutting a throat if they can get an opportunity of doing so."
 
    "And I expect they will."
 
     "Yes, when there is a popular excitement against any man, he had better
leave this part at once and altogether.  It is dangerous to tamper with
popular prejudices; no man who has any value for his life ought to do so.  
It
is a sheer act of suicide."

 Superstition.




                                Chapter LIV.

THE BURNING OF VARNEY'S HOUSE. -- A NIGHT SCENE. -- POPULAR SUPERSTITION.


     The officer ceased to speak, and then the party whom he had sent round
the house and grounds returned, and gained the main body orderly enough, and
the sergeant went forward to make his report to his superior officer.

     After the usual salutation, he waited for the inquiry to be put to him 
as
to what he had seen.

     "Well, Scott, what have you done?"

     "I went round the premises, sir, according to your instructions, but 
saw
no one either in the vicinity of the house, or in the grounds around it."

     "No strangers, eh?"

     "No, sir, none."

     "You saw nothing at all likely to lead to any knowledge as to who it 
was
that has caused this catastrophe?"

     "No, sir."

     "Have you learnt anything among the people who are the perpetrators of
this fire?"

     "No, sir."

     "Well, then, that will do, unless there is anything else that you can
think of."

     "Nothing further, sir, unless it is that I heard some of them say that
Sir Francis Varney has persished in the flames."

     "Good heavens!"

     "So I heard, sir."

     "That must be impossible, and yet why should it be so?  Go back, Scott,
and bring me some person who can give me some information upon this point."

     The sergeant departed towards the people, who looked at him without any
distrust, for he came single-handed, though they thought he came with the
intention of learning what they knew of each other, and so stroll about with
the intention of getting up accusations against them.  But this was not the
case; the officer didn't like the work well enough; he'd rather have been
elsewhere.

     At length the sergeant came to one man, whom he accosted, and said to
him,--

     "Do you know anything of yonder fire?"

     "Yes; I do know it is a fire."

     "Yes, and so do I."

     "My friend," said the sergeant, "when a soldier asks a question he does
not expect an uncivil answer."

     "But a soldier may ask a question that may have an uncivil end to it."

     "He may; but it is easy to say so."

     "I do say so, then, now."

     "Then I'll not trouble you any more."

     The sergeant moved on a pace or two more, and then, turning to the mob,
he said,--

     "Is there any one among you who can tell me anything concerning the 
fate
of Sir Francis Varney?"

     "Burnt!"

     "Did you see him burnt?"

     "No; but I saw him."

     "In the flames?"

     "No; before the house was on fire."

     "In the house?"

     "Yes; and he has not been seen to leave it since, and we conclude he 
must
have been burned."

     "Will you come and say as much to my commanding officer?  It is all I
want."

     "Shall I be detained?"

     "No."

     "Then I will go," said the man, and he hobbled out of the crowd towards
the sergeant.  "I will go and see the officer, and tell him what I know, and
that is very little, and can prejudice no one."

     "Hurrah!" said the crowd, when they heard this latter assertion; for, 
at
first, they began to be in some alarm lest there should be something wrong
about this, and some of them get identified as being active in the fray.

     The sergeant let the man back to the spot, where the officer stood a
little way in advance of his men.

     "Well, Scott," he said, "what have we here?"

     "A man who has volunteered a statement, sir."

     "Oh!  Well, my man, can you say anything concerning all this 
disturbance
that we have here?"

     "No, sir."

     "Then what did you come here for?"

     "I understood the sergeant to want some one who could speak of Sir
Francis Varney."

     "Well?"

     "I saw him."

     "Where?"

     "In the house.

     "Exactly; but have you not seen him out of it?"

     "Not since; nor any one else, I believe."

     "Where was he?"

     "Upstairs, where he suddenly disappeared, and nobody can tell where he
may have gone to.  But he has not been seen out of the house since, and they
say he could not have gone bodily out if they had not seen him."

     "He must have been burnt," said the officer, musingly; "he could not
escape, one would imagine, without being seen by some one out of such a 
mob."

     "Oh, dear no, for I am told they placed a watch at every hole, window, 
or
door, however high, and they say nothing of him-- not even fly out!"

     "Fly out!  I'm speaking of a man!"

     "And I of a vampire!" said the man, carelessly.

     "A vampyre!  Pooh, pooh!"

     "Oh no!  Sir Francis Varney is a vampyre!  There can be no sort of 
doubt
about it.  You have only to look at him, and you will soon be satisfied of
that.  See his great sharp teeth in front, and ask yourself what they are 
for,
and you will soon find the answer.  They are to make holes with in the 
bodies
of his victims, through which he can suck their blood!"

     The officer looked at the man in astonishment for a few moments, as if 
he
 doubted his own ears, and then he said,--

     "Are you serious?"

     "I am ready to swear to it."

     "Well, I have heard a great deal about popular superstition, and 
thought
I had seen something of it; but this is decidedly the worst case that ever I
saw or heard of.  You had better go home, my man, than, by your presence,
countenance such a gross absurdity."

     "For all that," said the man, "Sir Francis Varney is a vampyre-- a 
blood-
sucker-- a human blood-sucker!"

     "Get away with you," said the officer, "and do not repeat such folly
before any one."

     The man almost jumped when he heard the tone in which this was spoken,
for the officer was both angry and contemptuous, when he heard the words of
the man.

     "These people," he added, turning to the sergeant, "are ignorant in the
extreme.  One would think we had got into the country of vampires, instead 
of
a civilised community."

     The day was going down now; the last rays of the setting sun glimmered
upwards, and still shone upon the tree-tops.  The darkness of night was 
still
fast closing around them.  The mob stood a motley mass of human beings, 
wedged
together, dark and sombre, gazing upon the mischief that had been done-- the 
work of their hands.  The military stood at ease before the burning pile, 
and
by their order and regularity, presented a contrast to the mob, as strongly 
by
their bright gleaming arms, as by their dress and order.

     The flames now enveloped the whole mansion.  There was not a window or 
a
door from which the fiery element did not burst forth in clouds, and forked
flames came rushing forth with a velocity truly wonderful.

     The red glare of the flames fell upon all objects around for some
distance-- the more especially so, as the sun had sunk, and a bank of clouds
rose from beneath the horizon and excluded all his rays; there was no
twilight, and there was, as yet, no moon.

     The country side was enveloped in darkness, and the burning house could
be seen for miles around, and formed a rallying-point to all men's eyes.

     The engines that were within reach came tearing across the country, and
came to the fire; but they were of no avail.  There was no supply of water,
save from the ornamental ponds.  These they could only get at by means that
were tedious and unsatisfactory, considering the emergency of the case.

     The house was a lone one, and it was being entirely consumed before 
they
arrived, and therefore there was not the remotest chance of saving the least
article.  Had they ever such a supply of water, nothing could have been
effected by it.

     Thus the men stood idly by, passing their remarks upon the fire and the
mob.

     Those who stood around, and within the influence of the red glare of 
the
flames, looked like so many demons in the infernal regions, watching the
progress of lighting the fire, which we are told by good Christians is the
doom of the unfortunate in spirit, and the woefully unlucky in 
circumstances.

     It was a strange sight that; and there were many persons who would,
without doubt, have rather been snug by their own fire-side than they would
have remained there; but it happened that no one felt inclined to express 
his
inclination to his neighbour, and, consequently, no one said anything on the
subject.

     None would venture to go alone across the fields, where the spirit of 
the
vampyre might, for all they knew to the contrary, be waiting to pounce upon
them, and worry them.

     No, no; no man would have quitted that mob to go back alone to the
village; they would sooner have stood there all night through.  That was an
alternative that none of the number would very willingly accept.

     The hours passed away, and the house that had been that morning a noble
and well-furnished mansion, was now a smouldering heap of ruins.  The flames
had become somewhat subdued, and there was now more smoke than flames.

     The fire had exhausted itself.  There was now no more material that 
could
serve it for fuel, and the flames began to become gradually enough subdued.

     Suddenly there was a rush, and then a bright flame shot upward for an
instant, so bright and so strong, that it threw a flash of light over the
country for miles; but it it was only momentary, and it subsided.

     The roof, which had been built strong enough to resist almost anything,
after being burning for a considerable time, suddenly gave way, and came in
with a tremendous crash, and then all was for a moment darkness.

     After this the fire might be said to be subdued, it having burned 
itself
out; and the flames that could now be seen were but the result of so much
charred wood, that would probably smoulder away for a day or two, if left to
itself to do so.  A dense mass of smoke arose from the ruins, and blackened
the atmosphere around, and told the spectators the work was done.

of
 the mob. -- The grocer's revenge.




                                 Chapter LV.

THE RETURN OF THE MOB AND MILITARY TO THE TOWN. -- THE MADNESS OF THE MOB. -
-
THE GROCER'S REVENGE.


     On the termination of the conflagration, or, rather, the fall of the 
roof, with the loss of grandeur in the spectacle, men's minds began to be 
free
from the exitement that chained them to the spot, watching the progress of
that element which has been truly described as a very good servant, but a 
very
bad master; and of the truth of this every one must be well satisfied.

     There was now remaining little more than the livid glare of the hot and
burning embers; and this did not extend far, for the walls were too strongly
built to fall in from their own weight; they were strong and stout, and
intercepted the little light the ashes would have given out.

     The mob now began to feel fatigued and chilly.  It had been standing 
and
walking about many hours, and the approach of exhaustion could not be put 
off
much longer, especially as there was no longer any great excitement to carry
it off.

     The officer, seeing that nothing was to be done, collected his men
together, and they were soon seen in motion.  He had been ordered to stop 
any
tumult that he might have seen, and to save any property.  But there was
nothing to do now; all the property that could have been saved was now
destroyed, and the mob were beginning to disperse, and creep towards their 
own
houses.

     The order was then given for the men to take close order, and keep
together, and the word to march was given, which the men obeyed with 
alacrity,
for they had no good-will in stopping there the whole of the night.

     The return to the village of both the mob and the military was not
without its vicissitudes; accidents of all kinds were rife amongst them; the
military, however, taking the open paths, soon diminished the distance, and
that, too, with little or no accidents, save such as might have been 
expected
from the state of the fields, after they had been so much trodden down of
late.

     Not so the townspeople or the peasantry; for, by way of keeping up 
their
spirits, and amusing themselves on their way home, they commenced larking, 
as
they called it, which often meant the execution of practical jokes, and 
these
sometimes were of a serious nature.

     The night was dark at that hour, especially so when there was a number 
of
persons traversing about, so that little or nothing could be seen.

     The mistakes and blunders that were made were numerous.  In one place
there were a number of people penetrating a path that lead only to a hedge 
and
deep ditch; indeed it was a brook very deep and muddy.

     Here they came to a stop and endeavoured to ascertain its width, but 
the
little reflected light they had was deceptive, and it did not appear so 
broad
as it was.

     "Oh, I can jump it," exclaimed one.

     "And so an I," said another, "I have done so before, and why should I 
not
do so now."

     This was unanswerable, and as there were many present, at least a dozen
were eager to jump.

     "If thee can do it, I know I can," said a brawny countryman; "so I'll 
do
it at once."

     "The sooner the better," shouted some one behind, "or you'll have no 
room
for a run, here's a lot of 'em coming up; push over as quickly as you can."

     Thus urged, the jumpers at once made a rush to the edge of the ditch, 
and
many jumped, and many more, from the prevailing darkness, did not see 
exactly
where the ditch was, and taking one or two steps too many, found themselves 
up
above the waist in muddy water.

     Nor were those who jumped much better off, for nearly all jumped short 
or
fell backwards into the stream, and were dragged out in a terrible state.

     "Oh, lord! oh, lord!" exclaimed one poor fellow, dripping wet and
shivering with cold, "I shall die! oh, the rheumatiz; there'll be a pretty
winter for for me; I'm half dead."

     "Hold your noise," said another, "and help me to get the mud out of my
eye; I can't see."

     "Never mind," added a third, "considering how you jump, I don't think 
you
want to see."

     "This comes a hunting vampyres."

     "Oh, it's all a judgment; who knows but he mayh be in the air; it is
nothing to laugh at as I shouldn't be surprised if he were; only think how
precious pleasant."

     "However pleasant it may be to you," remarked one, "it's profitable to 
a
good many."

     "How so?"

     "Why, see the numbers of things that will be spoiled, coats torn, hats
crushed, heads broken, and shoes burst.  Oh, it's an ill-wind that blows
nobody any good."

     "So it is, but you may benefit anybody you like, so you don't do it at 
my
expence."

     In one part of a field where there were some stiles and gates, a big
countryman caught a fat shopkeeper with the arms of the stile a terrible 
poke
in the stomach; while the breath was knocked out of the poor man's stomach,
and he was gasping with agony, the fellow set to laughing, and said to his
companions, who were of the same class--

     "I say, Jim, look at the grocer, he hasn't got any wind to spare, I'd 
run
him for a wager, see how he gapes like a fish out of water."

     The poor shopkeeper felt indeed like a fish out of water, and as he
afterwards declared he felt just as if he had had a red hot clock weight
thrust into the midst of his stomach and there left to cool.

     However, the grocer would be revenged upon his tormentor, who had now
lost sight of him, but the fat man, after a time, recovering his wind, and 
the
pain in his stomach becoming less intense, he gathered himself up.

     "My name ain't Jones," he muttered, "if I don't be one to his one for
that; I'll do something that shall make him remember what it is to insult a
respectable tradesman.  I'll never forgive such an insult.  It is dark, and
that's why it is he has dared to do this."

     Filled with dire thoughts and a spirit of revenge, he looked from side 
to
side to see with what he could effect his object, but could espy nothing.

     "It's shameful," he muttered; "what would I give for a little retort. 
I'd plaster his ugly countenance."

     As he spoke, he placed his hands on some pales to rest himself, when he
found that they stuck to them, the pales had that day been newly pitched.

     A bright idea now struck him.

     "If I could only get a handful of this stuff," he thought, "I should be
able to serve him out for serving me out.  I will, cost what it may; I'm
resolved upon that.  I'll not have my wind knocked out, and my inside set on
fire for nothing.  No, no; I'll be revenged on him."

     With this view he felt over the pales, and found that he could scrape 
off
a little only, but not with his hands; indeed, it only plastered them; he,
therefore, marched about for something to scrape it off with.

     "Ah, I have a knife, a large pocket knife, that will do, that is the 
sort
of thing I want."

     He immediately commenced feeling for it, but had scarcely got his hand
into his pocket when he found there would be a great difficulty in either
pushing it in further or withdrawing it altogether, for the pitch made it
difficult to do either, and his pocket stuck to his hands like a glove.

     "D--n it," said the grocer, "who would have thought of that! here's a
pretty go, curse that fellow, he is the cause of all this; I'll be revenged
upon him, if it's a year hence."

     The enraged grocer drew his hand out, but was unable to effect his 
object
in withdrawing the knife also; but he saw something shining, he stooped to
pick it up, exclaiming as he did so, in a gratified tone of voice,

     "Ah, here's something that will do better."

     As he made a grasp at it, he found he had inserted his hand into
something soft.

     "God bless me! what now?"

     He pulled his hand hastily away, and found that it stuck slightly, and
then he saw what it was.

     "Ay, ay, the very thing.  Surely it must have been placed here on 
purpose
by the people."

     The fact was, he had placed his hand into a pot of pitch that had been
left by the people who had been at work at pitching the pales, but had been
attracted by the fire at Sir Francis Varney's, and to see which they had 
left
their work, and the pitch was left on a smouldering peat fire, so that when
Mr. Jones, the grocer, accidentally put his hand into it he found it just
warm.

     When he made this discovery he dabbed his hand again into the pitch-
pot,
exclaiming,--

     "In for a penny, in for a pound."

     And he endeavoured to secure as large a handful of the slippery and
stickey stuff as he could, and this done he set off to come up with the big
countryman who had done him so much indignity and made his stomach
uncomfortable.

     He soon came up with him, for the man had stopped rather behind, and 
was
larking, as it is called, with some men, to whom he was a companion.

     He had slipped down a bank, and was partially sitting down on the soft
mud.  In his bustle, the little grocer came down with a slide, close to the
big countryman.

     "Ah-- ah! my little grocer," said the countryman, holding out his hand 
to
catch him, and drawing him towards himself, "You will come and sit down by 
the
side of your old friend."

     As he spoke, he endeavoured to pull Mr. Jones down, too; but that
individual only replied by fetching the countryman a swinging smack across 
the
face with the handful of pitch.

     "There, take that; and now we are quits; we shall be old friends after
this, eh?  Are you satisfied?  You'll remember me, I'll warrant."

     As the grocer spoke, he rubbed his hands over the face of the fallen 
man,
and then rushed from the spot with all the haste he could make.

     The countryman sat a moment or two confounded, cursing, and swearing, 
and
spluttering, vowing vengeance, believing that it was mud only that had been
plastered over his face; but when he put his hands up, and found out what it
was, he roared and bellowed like a town-bull.

     He cried out to his companions that his eyes were pitched; but they 
only
laughed at him, thinking he was having some foolish lark with them.

     It was next day before he got home, for he wandered about all night; 
and
it took him a week to wash the pitch off by means of grease; and ever
afterwards he recollected the pitching of his face; nor did he ever forget 
the
grocer.

     Thus it was the whole party returned a long while after dark across the
fields, with all the various accidents that were likely to befal such an
assemblage of people.

     The vampyre hunting cost many of them dear, for clothes were injured on
all sides, hats lost, and shoes missing in a manner that put some of the
rioters to much inconvenience.  Soon afterwards, the military retired to 
their
quarters; and the townspeople at length became tranquil, and nothing more 
was
heard or done that night.

                                Chapter LVI.

THE DEPARTURE OF THE BANNERWORTHS FROM THE HALL. -- THE NEW ABODE. -- JACK
PRINGLE, PILOT.


     During that very evening, on which the house of Sir Francis Varney was
fired by the mob, another scene, and one of a different character, was 
enacted
at Bannerworth Hall, where the owners of that ancient place were departing
from it.

     It was towards the latter part of the day, that Flora Bannerworth, Mrs.
Bannerworth, and Henry Bannerworth, were preparing themselves to depart from
the house of their ancestors.  The intended proprietor was, as we have 
already
been made acquainted with, the old admiral, who had taken the place somewhat
mysteriously, considering the way in which he usually did business.

     The admiral was walking up and down the lawn before the house, and
looking up at the windows every now and then; and turning to Jack Pringle, 
he
said,--

     "Jack, you dog."

     "Ay-- ay sir."

     "Mind you convoy these women into the right port; do you hear? and no
mistaking the bearings; do you hear?"

     "Ay, ay sir."

     "These crafts want care; and you are pilot, commander, and all; so mind
and keep your weather eye open."

     "Ay, ay, sir.  I knows the craft well enough, and I knows the roads, 
too;
there'll be no end of foundering against the breakers to find where they 
lie."

     "No, no, Jack; you needn't do that; but mind your bearings.  Jack, mind
your bearings."

     "Never fear; I know 'em, well enough; my eyes ain't laid up in ordinary
yet."

     "Eh?  What do you mean by that, you dog, eh?"

     "Nothing; only I can see without helps to read, or glasses either; so I
know one place from another."

     There was now some one moving within; and the admiral, followed by Jack
Pringle, entered the Hall.  Henry Bannerworth was there.  They were all 
ready
to go when the coach came for them, which the admiral had ordered for them.

     "Jack, you lubber; where are you?"

     "Ay, ay, sir, here am I."

     "Go, and station yourself up in some place where you can keep a good
look-out for the coach, and come and report when you see it."

     "Ay-- ay, sir," said Jack, and away he went from the room, and 
stationed
himself up in one of the trees, that commanded a good view of the main road
for some distance.

     "Admiral Bell," said Henry, "here we are, trusting implicitly to you; 
and
in doing so, I am sure I am doing right."

     "You will see that," said the admiral.  "All's fair and honest as yet;
and what is to come, will speak for itself."

     "I hope you won't suffer from any of these nocturnal visits," said 
Henry.

     "I don't much care about them; but old Admiral Bell don't strike his
colours to an enemy, however ugly he may look.  No, no; it must be a better
craft than his own that'll take him; and one who won't run away, but that 
will
grapple yard-arm and yard-arm, you know."

     "Why, admiral, you must have seen many dangers in your time, and be 
used
to all kinds of disturbances and conflicts.  You have had a life of
experience."

     "Yes; and experience has come pretty thick sometimes, I can tell you,
when it comes in the shape of Frenchmen's broadsides."

     "I dare say, then, it must be rather awkward."

     "Death by the law," said the admiral, "to stop one of them with your
head, I assure you.  I dare not make the attempt myself, though I have often
seen it done."

     "I dare say; but here are Flora and my mother."

     As he spoke, Flora and her mother entered the apartment.

     "Well, admiral, we are all ready; and, though I may feel somewhat sorry
at leaving the old Hall, yet it arises from attachment to the place, and not
any disinclination to be beyond the reach of these dreadful alarms."

     "And I, too, shall be by no means sorry," said Flora; "I am sure it is
some gratification to know we leave a friend here, rather than some others,
who would have had the place, if they could have got it, by any means."

     "Ah, that's true enough, Miss Flora," said the admiral; "but we'll run
the enemy down yet, depend upon it.  But once away, you will be free from
these terrors; and now, as you have promised, do not let yourselves be seen
any where at all."

     "You have our promises, admiral; and they shall be religiously kept, I
can assure you."

     "Boat, ahoy-- ahoy!" shouted Jack.

     "What boat?" said the admiral, surprised; and then he muttered, 
"Confound
you for a lubber!  Didn't I tell you to mind your bearings, you dog-fish 
you?"

     "Ay, ay, sir-- and so I did."

     "You did."

     "Yes, here they are.  Squint over the larboard bulk-heads, as they call
walls, and then atween the two trees on the starboard side of the course, 
then
straight ahead for a few hundred fathoms, when you come to a funnel as is
smoking like the crater of Mount Vesuvius, and then in a line with that on 
the
top of the hill, comes our boat."

     "Well," said the admiral, "that'll do.  Now go open the gates, and keep 
a
bright look out, and if you see anybody near your watch, why douse their
glim."

     "Ay-- ay, sir," said Jack, and he disappeared.

     "Rather a lucid description," said Henry, as he thought of Jack's 
report
to the admiral.

     "Oh, it's a seaman's report.  I know what he means; it's quicker and
plainer than the land lingo, to my ears, and Jack can't talk any other, you
see."

     By this time the coach came into the yard, and the whole party 
descended
into the court-yard, where they came to take leave of the old place.

     "Farewell, admiral."

     "Good bye," said the admiral.  "I hope the place you are going to will 
be
such as will please you-- I hope it will."

     "I am sure we shall endeavour to be pleased with it, and I am pretty 
sure
we shall."

     "Good bye."

     "Farewell, Admiral Bell," said Henry.

     "You remember your promises?"

     "I do.  Good bye, Mr. Chillingworth."

     "Good bye," said Mr. Chillingworth, who came up to bid them farewell; 
"a
pleasant journey, and may you all be the happier for it."

     "You do not come with us?"

     "No; I have some business of importance to attend to, else I should 
have
the greatest pleasure in doing so.  But good bye; we shall not be long 
apart,
I dare say."

     "I hope not," said Henry.

     The door of the carriage was shut by the admiral, who looked round,
saying,--

     "Jack-- Jack Pringle, where are you, you dog?"

     "Here am I," said Jack.

     "Where have you been to?"

     "Only been for pigtail," said Jack.  "I forgot it, and couldn't set 
sail
without it."

     "You dog you; didn't I tell you to mind your bearings?"

     "So I will," said Jack, "fore and aft-- fore and aft, admiral."

     "You had better," said the admiral, who, however, relaxed into a broad
grin, which he concealed from Jack Pringle.

     Jack mounted the coach-box, and away it went, just as it was getting
dark.  The old admiral had locked up all the rooms in the presence of Henry
Bannerworth; and when the coach had gone out of sight, Mr. Chillingworth 
came
back to the Hall, where he joined the admiral.

     "Well," he said, "they are gone Admiral Bell, and we are alone; we have 
a
clear stage and no favour."

     "The two things of all others I most desire.  Now, they will be 
strangers
where they are going to, and that will be something gained.  I will 
endeavour
to do something if I get yard-arm and yard-arm with these pirates.  I'll 
make
'em feel the weight of true metal;  I'll board 'em-- d----e, I'll do
everything."

     "Everything that can be done."

     "Ay-- ay."

                          *       *       *       *

     The coach in which the family of the Bannerworths were carried away
continued its course without any let or hindrance, and they met no one on
their road during the whole drive.  The fact was, nearly everybody was at 
the
conflagration at Sir Francis Varney's house.

     Flora knew not which way they were going, and, after a time, all trace 
of
the road was lost.  Darkness set in, and they all sat in silence in the 
coach.

     At length, after some time had been spent thus, Flora Bannerworth 
turned
to Jack Pringle, and said,--

     "Are we near, or have we much further to go?"

     "Not very much, ma'am," said Jack.  "All's right, however-- ship in the
direct course, and no breakers ahead-- no lookout necessary; however there's 
a
landlubber aloft to keep a look out."

     As this was not very intelligible, and Jack seemed to have his own
reasons for silence, they asked him no further questions; but in about 
three-
quarters of an hour, during which time the coach had been driving through 
the
trees, they came to a standstill by a sudden pull of the checkstring from
Jack, who said,--

     "Hilloa!-- take in sails, and drop anchor."

     "Is this the place.?"

     "Yes, here we are," said Jack; "we're in port now, at all events;" and 
he
began to sing,--

"The trials and the dangers of the voyage is past,"

when the coach door opened, and they all got out and looked about them where
they were.

     "Up the garden if you please, ma'am-- as quick as you can; the night 
air
is very cold."

     Flora and her mother and brother took the hint, which was meant by Jack
to mean that they were not to be seen outside.  They at once entered a 
pretty
garden, and then they came to a very neat and picturesque cottage.  They had
no time to look up at it, as the door was immediately opened by an elderly
female, who was intended to wait upon them.

     Soon after, Jack Pringle and the coachman entered the passage with the
small amount of luggage which they had brought with them.  This was 
deposited
in the passage, and then Jack went out again, and, after a few minutes, 
there
was the sound of wheels, which intimated that the coach had driven off.

     Jack, however, returned in a few minutes afterwards, having secured the
wicket-gate at the end of the graden [sic], and then entered the house,
shutting the door carefully after him.

     Flora and her mother looked over the apartments in which they were 
shown
with some surprise.  It was, in everything, such as they could wish; indeed,
though it could not be termed handsomely or extravagantly furnished, or that
the things were new, yet there was all that convenience and comfort could
require, and some little of the luxuries.

     "Well," said Flora, "this is very thoughtful of the admiral.  The place
will really be charming, and the garden, too, delightful."

     "Mustn't be made use of just now," said Jack, "if you please, ma'am;
them's the orders at present."

     "Very well," said Flora, smiling.  "I suppose, Mr. Pringle, we must 
obey
them."

     "Jack Pringle, if you please," said Jack.  "My command's only 
temporary. 
I ain't got a commission."

 Next Time: The lonely watch, and the adventure in the deserted house.




                                Chapter LVII.
 
THE LONELY WATCH, AND THE ADVENTURE IN THE DESERTED HOUSE.

 
     It is now quite night, and so peculiar and solemn a stillness reigns in
and about Bannerworth Hall and its surrounding grounds, that one might have
supposed it a place of the dead, deserted completely after sunset by all who
would still hold kindred with the living.  There was not a breath of air
stirring, and this circumstance added greatly to the impression of profound
repose which the whole scene exhibited.
 
     The wind during the day had been rather of a squally character, but
towards nightfall, as is often usual after a day of such a character, it had
completely lulled, and the serenity of the scene was unbroken even by the
faintest sigh from a wandering zephyr.
 
     The moon rose late at that period, and as is always the case at that
interval between sunset and the rising of that luminary which makes the 
night
so beautiful, the darkness was of the most profound character.
 
     It was one of those nights to produce melancholy reflections-- a night 
on
which a man would be apt to review his past life, and to look into the 
hidden
recesses of his soul to see if conscience could make a coward of him in the
loneliness and stillness that breathed around.
 
     It was one of those nights in which wanderers in the solitude of nature
feel that the eye of Heaven is upon them, and on which there seems to be a
more visible connection between the world and its great Creator than upon
ordinary occasions.
 
     The solemn and melancholy appear places once instinct with life, when
deserted by those familiar forms and faces that have long inhabited them. 
There is no desert, no uninhabited isle in the far ocean, no wild, barren,
pathless tract of unmitigated sterility, which could for one moment compare 
in
point of loneliness and desolation to a deserted city.
 
     Strip London, mighty and majestic as it is, of the busy swarm of 
humanity
that throng its streets, its suburbs, its temples, its public edifices, and
its private dwellings, and how awful would be the walk of one solitary man
throughout its noiseless thoroughfares.
 
     If madness seized not upon him ere he had been long the sole survivor 
of
a race, he would need be cast in no common mould.
 
     And to descend from great things to smaller-- from the huge levathian
city to one mansion far removed from the noise and bustle of conventional
life, we may imagine the sort of desolation that reigned through Bannerworth
Hall, when, for the first time, after nearly a hundred and fifty years of
occupation, it was deserted by the representatives of that family, so many
members of which had lived and died beneath its roof.
 
     The house, and everything within, without, and around it, seemed 
actually
to sympathize with its own desolation and desertion.
 
     It seemed as if twenty years of continued occupation could not have
produced such an effect upon the ancient edifice as had those few hours of
neglect and desertion.
 
     And yet it was not as if it had been stripped of those time-worn and
ancient relics of ornament and furnishing that so long had appertained to 
it. 
No, nothing but the absence of those forms which had been accustomed quietly
to move from room to room, and to be met here upon a staircase, there upon a
corridor, and even in some of the ancient panelled apartments, which gave it
an air of dreary repose and listlessness.
 
     The shutters, too, were all closed, and that circumstance contributed
largely to the production of that gloomy effect which otherwise could not 
have
ensued.
 
     In fact, what could be done without attracting very special observation
was done to prove to any casual observer that the house was untenanted.
 
     But such was not really the case.  In that very room where the much
dreaded Varney the vampyre had made one of his dreaded appearances to Flora
Bannerworth and her mother, sat two men.
 
     It was from that apartment that Flora had discharged the pistol, which
had been left to her by her brother, and the shot from which it was believed
by the whole family had most certainly taken effect upon the person of the
vampyre.
 
     It was a room peculiarly accessible from the gardens, for it had long
French windows opening to the very ground, and but a stone step intervened
between the flooring of the apartment and a broad gravel walk which wound
round that entire portion of the house.
 
     It was in this room, then, that two men sat in silence, and nearly in
darkness.
 
     Before them, and on a table, were several articles of refreshment, as
well of defence and offence, according as their intentions might be.
 
     There were a bottle and three glasses, and lying near the elbow of one 
of
the men was a large pair of pistols, such as might have adorned the belt of
some desperate character, who wished to instil an opinion of his prowess 
into
his foes by the magnitude of his weapons.
 
     Close at hand, by the same party, lay some more modern fire-arms, as 
well
as a long dirk, with a silver mounted handle.
 
     The light they had consisted of a large lantern, so constructed with a
slide, that it could be completely obscured at a moment's notice; but now as
it was placed, the rays that were allowed to come from it were directed as
much from the window of the apartment, as possible, and fell upon the faces 
of
the two men, revealing them to be Admiral Bell and Dr. Chillingworth.
 
     It might have been the effect of the particular light in which he sat,
but the doctor looked extremely pale, and did not appear at all at his ease.
 
     The admiral, on the contrary, appeared in as placable a state of mind 
as
possible, and had his arms folded across his breast, and his head shrunk 
down
between his shoulders, as if he had made up his mind to something that was 
to
last a long time, and, therefore, he was making the best of it.
 
     "I do hope," said Mr. Chillingworth, after a long pause, "that our
efforts will be crowned with success-- you know, my dear sir, that I have
always been of your opinion, that there was a great deal more in this matter
than met the eye."
 
     "To be sure," said the admiral, "and as to to [sic] our efforts being
crowned with success, why, I'll give you a toast, doctor, 'may the morning's
reflection provide for the evening's amusement.'"
 
     "Ha! ha!" said Chillingworth, faintly; "I'd rather not drink any more,
and you seem, admiral, to have transposed the toast in some way.  I believe 
it
runs, 'may the evening's amusement bear the morning's reflection.'"
 
     "Transpose the devil!" said the admiral; "what do I care how it runs? I
gave you my toast, and as to that you mention, it's another one altogether,
and a sneaking, shore-going one too: but why don't you drink?"
 
     "Why, my dear sir, medically speaking, I am strongly of opinion that,
when the human stomach is made to contain a large quantity of alcohol, it
produces bad effects upon the system.  Now, I've certainly taken one glass 
of
this infernally strong Hollands, and it is now lying in my stomach like the
red-hot heater of a tea-urn."
 
     "Is it? put it out with another, then."
 
     "Ay, I'm afraid that would not answer; but do you really think, 
admiral,
that we shall effect anything by waiting here, and keeping watch and ward, 
not
under the most comfortable circumstances, this first night of the Hall being
empty."
 
     "Well, I don't know that we shall," said the admiral; "but when you
really want to steal a march upon the enemy, there is nothing like beginning
betimes.  We are both of opinion that Varney's great object throughout has
been, by some means or another, to get possession of the house."
 
     "Yes; true, true."
 
     "We know that he has been unceasing in his endeavours to get the
Bannerworth family out of it; that he has offered them their own price to
become its tenant, and that the whole gist of his quiet and placid interview
with Flora in the garden, was to supply her with a new set of reasons for
urging her mother and brother to leave Bannerworth Hall, because the old 
ones
were certainly not found sufficient."
 
     "True, true, most true," said Mr. Chillingworth, emphatically.  "You
know, sir, that from the first time you broached that view of the subject to
me, how entirely I coincided with you."
 
     "Of course you did, for you are a honest fellow, and a right-thinking
fellow, though you are a doctor, and I don't know that I like doctors, much
better than I like lawyers-- they're only humbugs in a different sort of 
way. 
But I wish to be liberal; there is such a thing as an honest lawyer, and, d-
--
e, you're an honest doctor!"
 
     "Of course I'm much obliged, admiral, for your good opinion.  I only 
wish
it had struck me to bring something of a solid nature in the shape of food, 
to
sustain the waste of the animal economy during the hours we shall have to 
wait
here."
 
     "Don't trouble yourself about that," said the admiral.  "Do you think 
I'm
a donkey, and would set out on a cruise without victualling my ship?  I 
should
think not.  Jack Pringle will be here soon, and he has my orders to bring in
something to eat."
 
     "Well," said the doctor, "that's very provident of you, admiral, and I
feel personally obliged; but tell me, how do you intend to conduct the 
watch?"
 
     "What do you mean?"
 
     "Why, I mean, if we sit here with the window fastened so as to prevent
our light from being seen, and the door closed, how are we by any 
possibility
to know if the house is attacked or not?"
 
     "Hark'ee, my friend," said the admrial; "I've left a weak point for the
enemy."
 
     "A what, admiral?"
 
     "A weak point.  I've taken good care to secure everything but one of 
the
windows on the ground floor, and that I've left open, or so nearly open, 
that
it will look like the most natural place in the world to get in at.  Now, 
just
inside that window, I've placed a lot of the family crockery.  I'll warrant,
if anybody so much as puts his foot in, you'll hear the smash;-- and, d---e,
there it is!"
 
     There was a long crash at this moment, followed by a succession of
similar sounds, but of a lesser degree; and both the admiral and Mr.
Chillingworth sprung to their feet.
 
     "Come on," cried the former; "here'll be a precious row-- take the
lantern."
 
     "Mr. Chillingworth did so, but he did not seem possessed of a great 
deal
of presence of mind; for, before they got out of the room, he twice
accidentally put on the dark slide, and produced a total darkness.
 
     "D---n!" said the admiral; "don't make it wink and wink in that way; 
hold
it up, and run after me as hard as you can."
 
     "I'm coming, I'm coming," said Mr. Chillingworth.
 
     It was one of the windows of a long room, containing five, fronting the
garden, which the admiral had left purposely unguarded; and it was not far
from the apartment in which they had been sitting, so that, probably, not 
half
a minute's time elapsed between the moment of the first alarm, and their
reaching the spot from whence it was presumed to arise.
 
     The admiral had armed himself with one of the huge pistols, and he 
dashed
forward, with all the vehemence of his character, towards the window, where 
he
knew he had placed the family crockery, and where he fully expected to meet
the reward of his exertion by discovering some one lying amid its fragments.
 
     In this, however, he was disappointed; for, although there was 
evidently
a great smash amongst the plates and dishes, the window remained closed, and
there was no indication whatever of the presence of any one.
 
     "Well, that's odd," said the admiral; "I balanced them up amazingly
careful, and two of 'em edgeways-- d---e, a fly would have knocked them 
down."
 
     "Mew," said a great cat, emerging from under a chair.
 
     "Curse you, there you are," said the admiral, "Put out the light, put 
out
the light; here we're illuminating the whole house for nothing."
 
     With a click went the darkening slide over the lantern, and all was
obscurity.
 
     At that instant a shrill, clear whistle came from the garden.

 Next Time: The Arrival of Jack Pringle. -- Midnight and the Vampyre. -- The
 Mysterious Hat.




                               Chapter LVIII.
 
THE ARRIVAL OF JACK PRINGLE -- MIDNIGHT AND THE VAMPYRE. -- THE MYSTERIOUS
HAT.
 

     "Bless me! what is that?" said Mr. Chillingworth; "what a very singular
sound."
 
     "Hold your noise," said the admiral; "did you never hear that before?"
 
     "No; how should I?"
 
     "Lor, bless the ignorance of some people, that's a boatswain's call."
 
     "Oh, it is," said Mr. Chillingworth; "is he going to call again?"
 
     "D---e, I tell ye it's a boatswain's call."
 
     "Well, then, d---e, if it comes to that," said Mr. Chillingworth, "what
does he call here for?"
 
     The admiral disdained an answer; but demanding the lantern, he opened 
it,
so that there was sufficient glimmering of light to guide him, and then 
walked
from the room towards the front door of the Hall.
 
     He asked no questions before he opened it, because, no doubt, the 
signal
was preconcerted; and Jack Pringle, for it was he indeed who had arrived, at
once walked in, and the admiral barred the door with the same precision with
which it was before secured.
 
     "Well, Jack," he said, "did you see anybody?"
 
     "Ay, ay, sir," said Jack.
 
     "Why, ye don't mean that-- where?"
 
     "Where I bought the grub; a woman--"
 
     "D---e, you're a fool, Jack."
 
     "You're another."
 
     "Hilloa, ye scoundrel, what d'ye mean by talking to me in that way?  Is
this your respect for your superiors?"
 
     "Ship's been paid off, long ago," said Jack, "and I ain't got no
superiors.  I ain't a marine or a Frenchman."
 
     "Why, you're drunk."
 
     "I know it; put that in your eye."
 
     "There's a scoundrel.  Why, you know-nothing-lubber, didn't I tell you 
to
be careful, and that everything depended upon secresy and caution?  and 
didn't
I tell you, above all this, to avoid drink?"
 
     "To be sure you did."
 
     "And yet you come here like a rum cask."
 
     "Yes; now you've had your say, what then?"
 
     "You'd better leave him alone," said Mr. Chillingworth; "it's no use
arguing with a drunken man."
 
     "Harkye, admiral," said Jack, steadying himself as well as he could.
"I've put up with you a precious long while, but I won't no longer; you're 
so
drunk, now, that you keeping bobbing up and down like the mizen gaff in a
storm-- that's my opinion-- tol de rol."
 
     "Let him alone, let him alone," urged Mr. Chillingworth.
 
     "The villain," said the admiral; "he's enough to ruin everything; now,
who would have thought that?  but it's always been the way with him for a
matter of twenty years-- he never had any judgment in his drink.  When it 
was
all smooth sailing, and nothing to do, and the fellow might have got an 
extra
drop on board, which nobody would have cared for, he's as sober as a judge;
but, whenever there's anything to do, that wants a little cleverness, 
confound
him, he ships rum enough to float a seventy-four."
 
     "Are you going to stand anything to drink," said Jack, "my old buffer? 
Do you recollect where you got your knob scuttled off Beyrout-- how you fell
on your latter end and tried to recollect your church cateckis, you old 
brute?-
- I's ashamed of you.  Do you recollect the brown girl you bought for 
thirteen
bob and a tanner, at the blessed Society Islands, and sold her again for a
dollar, to a nigger seven feet two, in his natural pumps?  you're a nice
article, you is, to talk of marines and swabs, and shore-going lubbers, blow
yer.  Do you recollect the little Frenchman that told ye he'd pull your
blessed nose, and I advised you to soap it?  do you recollect Sall at
Spithead, as you got in at a port hole of the state cabin, all but her
behind?"
 
     "Death and the devil!" said the admiral, breaking from the grasp of Mr.
Chillingworth.
 
     "Ay," said Jack, "you'll come to 'em both one of these days, old cock,
and no mistake."
 
     "I'll have his life, I'll have his life," roared the admiral.
 
     "Nay, nay, sir," said Mr. Chillingworth, catching the admiral round the
waist.  "My dear sir, recollect, now, if I may venture to advise you, 
Admiral
Bell, there's a lot of that fiery hollands you know, in the next room; set 
him
down to that, and finish him off.  I'll warrant him, he'll be quiet enough."
 
     "What's that you say?" cried Jack-- "hollands!-- who's got any?-- next 
to
rum and Elizabeth Baker, if I has an affection, it's hollands."
 
     "Jack!" said the admiral.
 
     "Ay, ay, sir!" said Jack, instinctively.
 
     "Come this way."
 
     Jack staggered after him, and they all reached the room where the 
admiral
and Mr. Chillingworth had been sitting before the alarm.
 
     "There!" said the admiral, putting the light upon the table, and 
pointing
to the bottle; "what do yo think of that?"
 
     "I never thinks under such circumstances," said Jack.  "Here's to the
wooden walls of old England!"
 
     He seized the bottle, and, putting its neck into his mouth, for a few
moments nothing was heard but a gurgling sound of the liquor passing down 
his
throat; his head went further and further back, until, at last, over he 
went,
chair and bottle and all, and lay in a helpless state of intoxication on the
floor.
 
     "So far, so good," said the admiral.  "He's out of the way, at all
events."
 
     "I'll just loosen his neckcloth," said Mr. Chillingworth, "and then 
we'll
go and sit somewhere else; and I should recommend that, if anywhere, we take
up our station in that chamber, once Flora's, where the mysterious panelled
portrait hangs, that bears so strong a resemblance to Varney, the vampyre."
 
     "Hush!" said the admiral.  "What's that?"
 
     They listened for a moment intently; and then, distinctly, upon the
gravel path outside the window, they heard a footstep, as if some person 
were
walking along, not altogether heedlessly, but yet without any very great
amount of caution or attention to the noise he might make.
 
     "Hist!" said the doctor.  "Not a word.  They come."
 
     "What do you say they for?" said the admiral.
 
     "Because something seems to whisper me that Mr. Marchdale knows more of
Varney, the vampyre, than ever he has chosen to reveal.  Put out the light."
 
     "Yes, yes-- that'll do.  The moon has risen; see how it streams through
the chinks of the shutters."
 
     "No, no-- it's not in that direction, or our light would have betrayed
us.  Do you not see the beams come from that half glass-door leading to the
greenhouse?"
 
     "Yes; and there's the footstep again, or another."
 
     Tramp, tramp came a footfall again upon the gravel path, and, as 
before,
died away upon their listening ears.
 
     "What do you say now," said Mr. Chillingworth-- "are there not two?"
 
     "If they were a dozen," said the admiral, "although we have lost one of
our force, I would tackle them.  Let's creep on through the rooms in the
direction the footsteps went."
 
     "My life on it," said Mr. Chillingworth, as they left the apartment, 
"if
this be Varney, he makes for that apartment where Flora slept, and which he
knows how to get admission to.  I've studied the house well, admiral, and to
get to that window any one from here outside must take a considerable round. 
Come on-- we shall be beforehand."
 
     "A good idea-- a good idea.  Be it so."
 
     Just allowing themselves sufficient light to guide them on the way from
the lantern, they hurried on with as much precipitation as the intricacies 
of
the passage would allow, nor halted till they had reached the chamber were
[sic] hung the portrait which bore so striking and remarkable a likeness to
Varney, the vampyre.
 
     They left the lamp outside the door, so that not even a straggling beam
from it could betray that there were persons on the watch; and then, as
quietly as foot could fall, they took up their station among the hangings of
the antique bedstead, which has been before alluded to in this work as a
remarkable piece of furniture appertaining to that apartment.
 
     "Do you think," said the admiral, "we've distanced them?"
 
     "Certainly we have.  It's unlucky that the blind of the window is 
down."
 
     "Is it?  By Heaven, there's a d---d strange-looking shadow creeping 
over
it."
 
     Mr. Chillingworth looked almost with suspended breath.  Even he could 
not
altogether get rid of a tremulous feeling, as he saw that the shadow of a
human form, apparently of very large dimensions, was on the outside, with 
the
arms spread out, as if feeling for some means of opening the window.
 
     It would have been easy now to have fired one of the pistols direct 
upon
the figure; but, somehow or another, both the admiral and Mr. Chillingworth
shrank from that course, and they felt much rather inclined to capture 
whoeve
might make his appearance, only using their pistols as a last resource, than
gratuitously and at once to resort to violence.
 
     "Who should you say that was?" whispered the admiral.
 
     "Varney, the vampyre."
 
     "D---e, he's ill-looking adn big enough for anything-- there's a 
noise!"
 
     There was a strange cracking sound at the window, as if a pane of glass
was being very stealthily and quietly broken; and then the blind was 
agitated
slightly, confusing much the shadow that was cast upon it, as if the hand of
some person was introduced for the purpose of effecting a complete entrance
into the apartment.
 
     "He's coming in," whispered the admiral.
 
     "Hush, for Heaven's sake!" said Mr. Chillingworth; "you will alarm him,
and we shall lose the fruit of all the labour we have already bestowed upon
the matter; but did you not say something, admiral, about lying under the
window and catching him by the leg?"
 
     "Why, yes; I did."
 
     "Go and do it, then; for, as sure as you are a living man, his leg will
be in in a minute."
 
     "Here goes," said the admiral; "I never suggest anything which I'm
unwilling to do myself."
 
     Whoever it was that now was making such strenuous exertions to get into
the apartment seemed to find some difficulty as regarded the fastenings of 
the
window, and as this difficulty increased, the patience of the party, as well
as his caution deserted him, and the casement was rattled with violence.
 
     With a far greater amount of caution than any one from a knowledge of 
his
character would have given him credit for, the admiral crept forward and 
laid
himself exactly under the window.
 
     The depth of the wood-work from the floor to the lowest part of the
window-frame did not exceed above two feet; so that any one could 
conveniently
step in from the balcony outside on to the floor of the apartment, which was
just what he who was attempting to effect an entrance was desirous of doing.
 
     It was quite clear that, be he who he might, mortal or vampyre, he had
some acquaintance with the fastening of the window; for now he succeeded in
moving it, and the sash was thrown open.
 
     The blind was still an obstacle; but a vigorous pull from the intruder
brought that down on the prostate admiral; and then Mr. Chillingworth saw, 
by
the moonlight, a tall, gaunt figure, standing in the balcony, as if just
hesitating for a moment whether to get head first or feet first into the
apartment.
 
     Had he chosen the former alternative he would need, indeed, to have 
been
endowed with more than mortal powers of defence and offence to escape 
capture,
but his lucky star was in the ascendancy, and he put his foot in first.
 
     He turned his side to the apartment, and, as he did so, the bright
moonlight fell upon his face, enabling Mr. Chillingworth to see, without the
shadow of a doubt, that it was, indeed, Varney, the vampyre, who was thus
stealthily making his entrance into Bannerworth Hall, according to the
calculation which had been made by the admiral upon that subject.  The 
doctor
scarcely knew whether to be pleased or not at this discovery; it was almost 
a
terrifying one, sceptical as he was upon the subject of vampyres, and he
waited breathless for the issue of the singular and perilous adventure.
 
     No doubt Admiral Bell deeply congratulated himself upon the success 
which
was about to crown hsi stratagem for the capture of the intruder, be he who 
he
might, and he writhed with impatience for the foot to come sufficiently near
him to enable him to grasp it.
 
     His patience was not severely tried, for in another moment it rested 
upon
his chest.
 
     "Boarders a hoy!" shouted the admiral, and at once he laid hold of the
trespasser.  "Yard-arm to yard-arm.  I think I've got you now.  Here's a
prize, doctor! he shall go away without his leg if he goes away now.  Eh!
what! the light-- d---e, he has-- Doctor, the light! the light!  Why what'
this!-- Hilloa, there!"
 
     Dr. Chillingworth sprang into the passage, and procured the light-- in
another moment he was at the side of the admiral, and the lantern slide 
being
thrown back, he saw at once the dilemma into which his friend had fallen.
 
     There he lay upon his back, grasping, with the vehemence of an embrace
that had in it much of the ludicrous, a long boot, from which the intruder 
had
cleverly slipped his leg, leaving it as a poor trophy in the hands of his
enemies.
 
     "Why you've only pulled his boot off," said the doctor; "and now he's
gone for good, for he knows what we're about, and has slipped through your
fingers."
 
     Admiral Bell sat up and looked at the boot with a rueful countenance.
 
     "Done again!" he said.
 
     "Yes, you are done," said the doctor; "why didn't you lay hold of the 
leg
while you were about it, instead of the boot?  Admiral, are these your
tactics?"
 
     "Don't be a fool," said the admiral; "put out the light and give me the
pistols, or blaze away yourself into the garden; a chance shot may do
something.  It's no use running after him; a stern chase is a long chase; 
but
fire away."
 
     As if some parties below had heard him give his word, two loud reports
from the garden immediately ensued, and a crash of glass testified to the 
fact
that some deadly missile had entered the room.
 
     "Murder!" said the doctor, and he fell flat upon his back.  "I don't 
like
this at all; it's all in your line, admiral, but not in mine."
 
     "All's right, my lad," said the admiral; "now for it."
 
     He saw lying in the moonlight the pistols which he and the doctor had
brought into the room, and in another moment he, to use his own words,
returned the broadside of the enemy.
 
     "D--n it!" he said, "this puts me in mind of old times.  Blaze away, 
you
thieves, while I load; broadside to broadside.  It's your turn now; I scorn 
to
take an advantage.  What the devil's that?"
 
     Something very large and very heavy came bang against the window, 
sending
it all into the room, and nearly smothering the admiral with the fragments. 
Another shot was then fired, and in came something else, which hit the wall 
on
the opposite side of the room, rebounding from thence on to the doctor, who
gave a yell of despair.
 
     After that all was still; the enemy seemed to be satisfied that they 
had
silenced the garrison.  And it took the admiral a great deal of kicking and
plunging to rescue himself from some superincumbent mass that was upon him,
which seemed to him to be a considerable sized tree.
 
     "Call this fair fighting," he shouted-- "getting a man's legs and arms
tangled up like a piece of Indian matting in the branches of a tree?  
Doctor,
I say! hilloa! where are you?"
 
     "I don't know," said the doctor; "but there's somebody getting into the
balcony-- now we shall be murdered in cold blood."
 
     "Where's the pistols?"
 
     "Fired off, of course; you did it yourself."
 
     Bang came something else into the room, which, from the sound it made,
closely resembled a brick, and after that somebody jumped clean into the
centre of the floor, and then, after rolling and writhing about in a most
singular manner, slowly got up, and, with various preliminary hiccups, 
said,--
 
     "Come on, you lubbers, many of you as like.  I'm the tar for all
weathers."
 
     "Why, d--e," said the admiral, "it's Jack Pringle."
 
     "Yes it is," said Jack, who was not sufficiently sober to recognise the
admiral's voice.  "I sees as how you've heard of me.  Come on, all of you."
 
     "Why, Jack, you scoundrel," roared the admiral, "how came you here? 
Don't you know me?  I'm your admiral, you horse-marine."
 
     "Eh?" said Jack.  "Ay-- ay, sir, how came you here?"
 
     "How came you, you villain?"
 
     "Boarded the enemy."
 
     "The enemy who you boarded was us; and hang me if I don't think you
haven't been pouring broadsides into us, while the enemy were scudding 
before
the wind in another direction."
 
     "Lor!" said Jack.
 
     "Explain, you scoundrel, directly-- explain."
 
     "Well, that's only reasonable," said Jack; and giving a heavier lurch
than usual, he sat down with a great bounce upon the floor.  "You see it's
just this here,-- when I was a coming of course I heard, just as I was a
going, that ere as made me come all in consequence of somebody a going, or 
for
to come, you see, admiral."
 
     "Doctor," cried the admiral, in a great rage, "just help me out of this
entanglement of branches, and I'll rid the world from an encumbrance by
smashing that fellow."
 
     "Smash yourself!" said Jack.  "You know you're drunk."
 
     "My dear admiral," said Mr. Chillingworth, laying hold of one of his
legs, and pulling it very hard, which brought his face into a lot of 
brambles,
"we're making a mess of this business."
 
     "Murder!" shouted the admiral; "you are indeed.  Is that what you call
pulling me out of it?  You've stuck me fast."
 
     "I'll manage it," said Jack.  "I've seed him in many a scrape, and I've
seed him out.  You pull me, doctor, and I'll pull him.  Yo hoy!"
 
     Jack laid hold of the admiral by the scuff of the neck, and the doctor
laid hold of Jack round the waist, the consequence of which was that he was
dragged out from the branches of the tree, which seemed to have been thrown
into the room, and down fell both Jack and the doctor.
 
     At this instant there was a strange hissing sound heard below the 
window;
then there was a sudden, loud report, as if a hand-grenade had gone off.  A
spectral sort of light gleamed into the room, and a tall, gaunt-looking 
figure
rose slowly up in the balcony.
 
     "Beware of the dead!" said a voice.  "Let the living contend with the
living, the dead with the dead.  Beware!"
 
     The figure disappeared, as did also the strange, spectral-looking 
light. 
A deathlike silence ensued, and the cold moonbeams streamed in upon the 
floor
of the apartment, as if nothing had occurred to disturb the wrapped repose 
and
serenity of the scene.

 Next Time: The Warning. -- The New Plan of Operation. -- The Insulting
 Message From Varney.




                                Chapter LIX.

THE WARNING. -- THE NEW PLAN OF OPERATION. -- THE INSULTING MESSAGE FROM
VARNEY.


     So much of the night had been consumed in these operations, that by the
time they were over, and the three personages who lay upon floor of what 
might
be called the haunted chamber of Bannerworth Hall, even had they now been
disposed to seek repose, would have had a short time to do so before the
daylight would have streamed in upon them, and roused them to the bustle of
waking existence.

     It may be well believed what a vast amount of surprise came over the
three persons in that chamber at the last little circumstance that had
occurred in connection with the night's proceedings.

     There was nothing which had preceded that, that did not resemble a
genuine attack upon the premises; but about that last mysterious appearance,
with its curious light, there was quite enough to bother the admiral and 
Jack
Pringle to a considerable effect, whatever might be the effect upon Mr.
Chillingworth, whose profession better enabled him to comprehend, 
chemically,
what would produce effects that, no doubt, astonished them amazingly.

     What with his intoxication and the violent exercise he had taken, Jack
was again thoroughly prostrate; while the admiral could not have looked more
astonished had the evil one himself appeared in _propria persona_ and given
him notice to quit the premises.

     He was, however, the first to speak, and the words he spoke were
addressed to Jack, to whom he said,--

     "Jack, you lubber, what do you think of all that?"

     Jack, however, was too far gone even to say "Ay, ay, sir;" and Mr.
Chillingworth, slowly getting himself up to his feet, approached the 
admiral.

     "It's hard to say so much, Admiral Bell," he said, "but it strikes me
that whatever object this Sir Francis Varney, o Varney, the vampyre, has in
coming into Bannerworth Hall, it is, at all events, of sufficient importance
to induce him to go any length, and not to let even a life to stand in the 
way
of it's accomplishment."

     "Well, it seems so," said the admiral; "for I'll be hanged if I can 
make
head or tail of the fellow."

     "If we value our personal safety, we shall hesitate to continue a
perilous adventure, which I think can end only in defeat, if not in death."

     "But we don't value our personal safety," said the admiral.  "We've got
into the adventure, and I don't see why we shouldn't carry it out.  It may 
be
growing a little serious; but what of that?  For the sake of that young 
girl,
Flora Bannerworth, as well as for the sake of my nephew, Charles Holland, I
will see the end of this affair, let it be what it may; but mind you, Mr.
Chillingworth, if one man chooses to go upon a desperate service, that's no
reason why he should ask another to do so."

     "I understand you," said Mr. Chillingworth; "but, having commenced the
adventure with you, I am not the man to desert you in it.  We have committed 
a
great mistake."

     "A mistake! how?"

     "Why, we ought to have watched outside the house, instead of within it.
There can be no doubt that if we had lain in wait in the garden, we should
have been in a better position to have accomplished our object."

     "Well, I don't  know, doctor, but is seems to me that if Jack Pringle
hadn't made such a fool of himself, we should have managed very well; and I
don't know now how he came to behave in the manner he did."

     "Nor I," said Mr. Chillingworth.  "But, at all events, so far as the
results goes, it is quite clear that any further watching, in this house, 
for
the appearance of Sir Francis Varney, will now be in vain.  He has nothing 
to
do now but to keep quiet until we are tired out-- a fact, concerning which 
he
can easily obtain information-- and then he immediately, without trouble,
walks into the premises, to his own satisfaction."

     "But what the deuce can he want upon the premises?"

     "That question, admiral, induces me to think that we have made another
mistake.  We ought not to have attempted to surprise Sir Francis Varney in
coming into Bannerworth Hall, but to catch him as he came out."

     "Well, there's something in that." said the admiral.  "This is a pretty
night's business, to be sure.  However, it can't be helped; it's done, and
there's an end on't.  And now, as the morning is near at hand, I certainly
must confess I should like to get some breakfast, although I don't like that
we should all leave the house together."

     "Why," said Mr. Chillingworth, "as we have now no secret to keep with
regard to our being here, because the principal person we wished to keep it
from is aware of it, I think we cannot do better than send at once for Henry
Bannerworth, tell him of the non-success of the effort we have made in his
behalf, and admit him at once into our consultation of what is next to be
done."

     "Agreed, agreed; I think that, without troubling him, we might have
captured this Varney; but that's over now, and, as soon as Jack Pringle
chooses to wake up again, I'll send him to the Bannerworths with a message."

     "Ay, ay, sir," said Jack, suddenly; "all's right."

     "Why, you vagabond," said the admiral, "I do believe you've been
shamming."

     "Shamming what?"

     "Being drunk, to be sure."

     "Lor! couldn't do it," said Jack; "I'll just tell you how it was.  I
wakened up and found myself shut in somewhere; and, as I couldn't get out of
the door, I thought I'd try the window, and there I did get out.  Well,
perhaps I wasn't quite the thing, but I sees two people in the garden a
looking up at this ere room; and, to be sure, I thought it was you and the
doctor.  Well, it warn't no business of mine to interfere, so I seed one of
you climb up the balcony, as I thought, and then, after which, come down 
head
over heels with such a run, that I thought you must have broken your neck.
Well, after that you fired a couple of shots in, and then, after that, I 
made
sure it was you, admiral."

     "And what made you make sure of that?"

     "Why, because you scuttled away like an empty tar-barrel in full tide."

     "Confound you, you scoundrel!"

     "Well, then, confound you, if it comes to that.  I thought I was doing
you good service, and that the enemy was here, when all the while it turned
out as you was and the enemy wasn't, and the enemy was outside and you
wasn't."

     "But who threw such a confounded lot of things into the room?"

     "Why, I did, of course; I had but one pistol, and, when I fired that 
off,
I was forced to make up a broadside with what I could."

     "Was there ever such a stupid!" said the admiral; "doctor, doctor, you
talked of us making two mistakes; but you forgot a third and worse one 
still,
and that was the bringing such a lubberly son of a seacook into the place as
this fellow."

     "You're another," said Jack; "and you knows it."

     "Well, well," said Mr. Chillingworth, "it's no use continuing it,
admiral; Jack, in his way, did, I dare say, what he considered for the 
best."

     "I wish he'd do, then, what he considers for the worst, next time."

     "Perhaps I may," said Jack, "and then you will be served out above a 
bit.
What 'ud become of you, I wonder, if it wasn't for me?  I'm as good as a
mother to you, you knows that, you old babby."

     "Come, come, admiral," said Mr. Chillingworth; "come down to the
gardengate; it is now just upon daybreak, and the probability is that we 
shall
not be long there before we see some of the country people, who will get us
anything we require in the shape of refreshment; and as for Jack, he seems
quite sufficiently recovered now to go to the Bannerworths'."

     "Oh! I can go," said Jack; "as for that, the only thing as puts me out 
of
the way is the want of something to drink.  My constitution won't stand what
they call temperance living, or nothing with the chill off."

     "Go at once," said the admiral, "and tell Mr. Henry Bannerworth that we
are here; but do not tell him before his sister or his mother.  If you meet
anybody on the road, send them here with a cargo of victuals.  It strikes me
that a good, comfortable breakfast wouldn't be at all amiss, doctor."

     "How rapidly the day dawns," remarked Mr. Chillingworth, as he walked
into the balcony from whence Varney, the vampire, had attempted to make good
his entrance to the Hall.

     Just as he spoke, and before Jack Pringle could get half way over to 
the
garden gate, there came a tremendous ring at the bell which was suspended 
over
it.

     A view of that gate could not be commanded from the window of the 
haunted
apartment, so that they could not see who it was that demanded admission.

     As Jack Pringle was going down at any rate, they saw no necessity for
personal interference; and he proved that there was not, by presently
returning with a note which he said had been thrown over the gate by a lad,
who then scampered off with all the speed he could make.

     The note, exteriorly, was well got up, and had all the appearance of
great care having been bestowed upon its folding and sealing.

     It was duly addressed to "Admiral Bell, Bannerworth Hall," and the word
"immediate" was written at one corner.

     The admiral, after looking at it for some time with very great wonder,
came at last to the conclusion that probably to open it would be the 
shortest
way of arriving at a knowledge of who had sent it, and he accordingly did 
so.

     The note was as follows:--

     "My dear sir,-- Feeling assured that you cannot be surrounded with 
those
means and appliances for comfort in the Hall, in its now deserted condition,
which you have a right to expect, and so eminently deserve, I flatter myself
that I shall receive an answer in the affirmative, when I request the favour
of your company to breakfast, as well as that of your learned friend, Mr.
Chillingworth.

     "In consequence of a little accident which occurred last evening to my
own residence, I am, _ad interim_, until the county build it up for me 
again,
staying at a house called Walmesley Lodge, where I shall expect you with all
the impatience of one soliciting an honour, and hoping that it will be
conferred upon him.

     "I trust that any little difference of opinion on other subjects will 
not
interfere to prevent the harmony of our morning's meal together.

     "Believe me to be, my dear sir, with the greatest possible 
consideration,
your very obedient, humble servant,

                              "FRANCIS VARNEY."

     The admiral gasped again, and looked at Mr. Chillingworth, and then at
the note, and then at Mr. Chillingworth again, as if he was perfectly
bewildered.

     "That's about the coolest piece of business," said Mr. Chillingworth,
"that ever I heard of."

     "Hang me," said the admiral, "if i sha'n't like the fellow at last.  It
is cool, and I like it because it is cool.  Where's my hat? where's my 
stick?"

     "What are you going to do?"

     "Accept his invitation, to be sure, and breakfast with him; and, my
learned friend, as he calls you, I hope you'll come likewise.  I'll take the
fellow at his word.  By fair means, or by foul, I'll know what he wants 
here;
and why he persecutes this family, for whom I have an attachment; and what
hand he has in the disappearance of my nephew, Charles Holland; for, as sure
as there's a Heaven above us, he's at the bottom of that affair.  Where is
this Walmesley Lodge?"

     "Just in the neighbourhood; but---"

     "Come on, then; come on."

     "But, really, admiral, you don't mean to say you'll breakfast with-- 
with---"

     "A vampyre?  Yes, I would, and will, and mean to do so.  Here, Jack, 
you
needn't go to Mr. Bannerworth's yet.  Come, my learned friend, let's take 
Time
by the forelock."

 Next Time: The Interrupted Breakfast at Sir Francis Varney's.




                                Chapter LX.

THE INTERRUPTED BREAKFAST AT SIR FRANCIS VARNEY'S.


     Notwithstanding all Mr. Chillingworth could say to the contrary, the
admiral really meant to breakfast with Sir Francis Varney.

     The worthy doctor could not for some time believe but that the admiral
must be joking, when he talked in such a strain; but he was very soon
convinced to the contrary, by the latter actually walking out and once more
asking him, Mr. Chillingworth, if he meant to go with him, or not.

     This was conclusive, so the doctor said, --

     "Well, admiral, this appears to me rather a mad sort of freak; but, as 
I
have begun the adventure with you, I will conclude it with you."

     "That's right," said the admiral; "I'm not deceived in you, doctor; so
come along.  Hang these vampyres, I don't know how to tackle them, myself.  
I
think, after all, Sir Francis Varney is more in your line than he is in 
mine."

     "How do you mean?"

     "Why, couldn't you persuade him he's ill, and wants some physic?  That
would soon settle him, you know."

     "Settle him!" said Mr. Chillingworth; "I beg to say, that if I did give
him any physic, the dose would be much to his advantage; but, however, my
opinion is, that this invitation to breakfast is, after all, a mere piece of
irony; and that, when we get to Walmesley Lodge, we shall not see anything 
of
him; on the contrary, we shall probably find it's a hoax."

     "I certainly should like that, but still it's worth the trying.  The
fellow has really behaved himself in such an extraordinary manner, that, if 
I
can make terms with him I will; and there's one thing, you know, doctor, 
that
I think we may say we have discovered."

     "And what may that be?  Is it, not to make too sure of a vampyre, even
when you have him by the leg?"

     "No, that ain't it, though that's a very good thing in its way; but it 
is
just this, that Sir Francis Varney, whoever he is and whatever he is, is 
after
Bannerworth Hall, and not the Bannerworth family.  If you recollect, Mr.
Chillingworth, in our conversation, I have always insisted upon that fact."

     "You have; and it seems to me to be completely verified by the
proceedings of the night.  There, then, admiral, is the great mystery -- 
what
can he want at Bannerworth Hall that makes him take such a world of trouble,
and run so many fearful risks in trying to get at it?"

     "That is, indeed, the mystery; and if he really means this invitation 
to
breakfast, I shall ask him plumply, and tell him, at the same time, that
possibly his very best way to secure his object will be to be candid, 
vampyre
as he is."

     "But really, admiral, you do not still cling to that foolish 
superstition
of believing that Sir Francis Varney is in reality a vampyre?"

     "I don't know, and I can't say; if anybody was to give me a description
of a strange sort of fish that I had never seen, I wouldn't take upon myself
to say there ain't such a thing; nor would you, doctor, if you had really 
seen
the many odd ones that I have encountered at various times."

     "Well, well, admiral, I'm certainly not belonging to that school of
philosophy which declares the impossible to be what it don't understand; 
there
may be vampyres, and there may be apparitions, for all I know to the 
contrary;
I only doubt these things, because I think, if they were true, that, as a
phenomena of nature, they would have been by this time established by 
repeated
instances without the possibility of doubt or cavil."

     Well, there's something in that; but how far have we got to go now?"

     "No further than to yon enclosure where you see those park- like 
looking
gates, and that cedar-tree stretching its dark- green foliage so far into 
the
road; this is Walmesley Lodge, whither you have been invited."

     "And you, my learned friend, recollect that you were invited too; so 
that
you are no intruder upon the hospitality of Varney the vampyre."

     "I say, admiral," said Mr. Chillingworth, when they reached the gates,
"you know it is not quite the thing to call a man a vampyre at his own
breakfast-table, so just oblige me by promising not to make any such remark 
to
Sir Francis."

     "A likely thing!" said the admiral; "he knows I know what he is, and he
knows I'm a plain man and a blunt speaker; however, I'll be civil to him, 
and
more than that I can't promise.  I must wring out of him, if I can, what has
become of Charles Holland, and what the deuce he really wants himself."

     "Well, well; come to no collision with him, while we're his guests."

     "Not if I can help it."

     The doctor rang at the gate bell of Walmesley Lodge, and was in a few
moments answered by a woman, who demanded their business.

     "Is Sir Francis Varney here?" said the doctor.

     "Oh, ah! yes," she replied; "you see his house was burnt down, for
something or other -- I'm sure I don't know what -- by some people -- I'm 
sure
I don't know who; so, as the lodge was to let, we have took him in till he 
can
suit himself."

     "Ah! that's it, is it?" said the admiral; "tell him that Admiral Bell 
and
Dr. Chillingworth are here."

     "Very well," said the woman; "you may walk in."

     "Thank ye; you're vastly obliging, ma'am.  Is there anything going on 
in
the breakfast line?"

     "Well, yes; I am getting him some breakfast, but he didn't say as he
expected company."

     The woman opened the garden gate, and they walked up a trimly laid out
garden to the lodge, which was a cottage-like structure in external
appearance, although within it boasted of all the comforts of a tolerably
extensive house.

     She left them in a small room, leading from the hall, and was absent
about five minutes; when she returned, and, merely saying that Sir Francis
Varney presented his compliments, and desired them to walk up stairs, she
preceded them up a handsome flight which led to the first floor of the 
lodge.

     Up to this moment, Mr. Chillingworth had expected some excuses, for,
notwithstanding all he had heard and seen of Sir Francis Varney, he could 
not
believe that any amount of impudence would suffice to enable him to receive
people as his guests, with whom he must feel that he was at such positive 
war.

     It was a singular circumstance; and, perhaps, the only thing that 
matched
the cool impertinence of the invitation, was the acceptance of it under the
circumstances by the admiral.

     Sir Francis Varney might have intended it as a jest; but if he did so, 
in
the first instance, it was evident he would not allow himself to be beaten
with his own weapons.

     The room into which they were shown was a longish narrow one; a very 
wide
door gave them admission to it, at the end nearest the staircase, and at its
other extremity there was  a similar door opening into some other apartments
of the house.

     Sir Francis Varney sat with his back towards this second door, and a
table, with some chairs and other articles of furniture, were so arranged
before him, that while they seemed but to be carelessly placed in the 
position
they occupied, they really formed a pretty good barrier between him and his
visitors.

     The admiral, however, was too intent upon getting a sight of Varney, to
notice any preparation of this sort, and he advanced quickly into the room.

     And there, indeed, was the much dreaded, troublesome, perservering, and
singular looking being who had caused such a world of annoyance to the 
family
of the Bannerworths, as well as disturbing the peace of the whole district,
which had the misfortune to have him as an inhabitant.

     If anything, he looked thinner, taller, and paler than usual, and there
seemed to be a slight nervousness of manner about him, as he slowly inclined
his head towards the admiral, which was not quite intelligible.

     "Well," said Admiral Bell, "you invited me to breakfast, and my learned
friend; here we are."

     "No two human beings," said Varney, "could be more welcome to my
hospitality than yourself and Dr. Chillingworth.  I pray you to be seated. 
What a pleasant thing it is, after the toils and struggles of this life,
occasionally to sit down in the sweet companionship of such dear friends."

     He made a hideous face as he spoke, and the admiral looked as if he 
were
half inclined to quarrel at that early stage of the proceedings.

     "Dear friends!" he said; "well, well -- it's no use squabbling about a
word or two; but I tell you what it is, Mr. Varney, or Sir Francis Varney, 
or
whatever your d----d name is -- "

     "Hold, my dear sir," said Varney -- "after breakfast, if you please --
after breakfast."

     He rang a hand-bell as he spoke, and the woman who had charge of the
house brought in a tray tolerably covered with the materials for a 
substantial
morning's meal.  She placed it upon the table, and certainly the various
articles that smoked upon it did great credit to her culinary powers.

     "Deborah," said Sir Varney, in a mild sort of tone, "keep on 
continually
bringing things to eat until this old brutal sea ruffian has satiated his
disgusting appetite."

     The admiral opened his eyes an enormous width, and, looking at Sir
Francis Varney, he placed his two fists upon the table and drew a long 
breath.

     "Did you address those observations to me," he said at length, "you
blood-sucking vagabond?"

     "Eh?" said Sir Francis Varney, looking over the admiral's head, as if 
he
saw something interesting on the wall beyond.

     "My dear admiral," said Mr. Chillingworth, "come away."

     "I'll see you d----d first!" said the admiral.  "Now, Mr. Vampyre, no
shuffling; did you address those observations to me?"

     "Deborah," said Sir Francis Varney, in the silvery tones, "you can 
remove
this tray and bring on the next."

     "Not if I know it," said the admiral.  "I came to breakfast, and I'll
have it; after breakfast I'll pull your nose -- ay, if you were fifty
vampyres, I'd do it."

     "Dr. Chillingworth," said Varney, without paying the least attention to
what the admiral said, "you don't eat, my dear sir; you must be fatigued 
with
your night's exertions.  A man of your age, you know, cannot be supposed to
roll and tumble about like a fool in a pantomime with impunity.  Only think
what a calamity it would be if you were laid up.  Your patients would all 
get
well, you know."

     "Sir Francis Varney," said Mr. Chillingworth, "we're your guests; we 
come
here at your invitation to partake of a meal. You have wantonly attacked 
both
of us.  I need not say that by so doing you cast a far greater slur upon 
your
own taste and judgment than you can upon us."

     "Admirably spoken," said Sir Francis Varney, giving his hands a clap
together that made the admiral jump again.  "Now, old Bell, I'll fight you, 
if
you think yourself aggrieved, while the doctor sees fair play."

     "Old who?" shouted the admiral.

     "Bell, Bell -- is not your name Bell? -- a family cognomen, I presume, 
on
account of the infernal clack, clack, without any sense in it, that is
characteristic of your race."

     "You'll fight me?" said the admiral, jumping up.

     "Yes, if you challenge me."

     "By Jove I do; of course."

     "Then I accept it; and the challenged party, you know well, or ought to
know, can make his own terms in the encounter."

     "Make what terms you please; I care not what they are.  Only say you 
will
fight, and that's sufficient."

     "It is well," said Sir Francis Varney, in a solemn tone.

     "Nay, nay," interrupted Mr. Chillingworth; "this is boyish folly."

     "Hold your row," said the admiral, "and let's hear what he's got to 
say."

     "In this mansion," said Sir Francis Varney -- "for a mansion it is,
although under the unpretending name of a lodge -- in this mansion there is 
a
large apartment which was originally fitted up by a scientific proprietor of
the place, for the purpose of microscopic and other experiments, which
required a darkness total and complete, such a darkness as seems as if it
could be felt -- palpable, thick, and obscure as the darkness of the tomb, 
and
I know what that is."

     "The devil you do!" said the admiral.  "It's damp, too, ain't it?"

     "The room?"

     "No; the grave."

     "Oh! uncommonly, after autumnal rains.  But to resume -- this room is
large, lofty, and perfectly empty."

     "Well?"

     "I propose that we procure two scythes."

     "Two what?"

     "Scythes, with their long handles, and their convenient holding 
places."

     "Well, I'll be hanged!  What next do you propose?"

     "You may be hanged.  The next is, that with these scythes we be both of
us placed in the darkened room, and the door closed, and doubly locked upon 
us
for one hour, and that then and there we do our best each to cut the other 
in
two.  If you succeed in dismembering me, you will have won the day; but I
hope, from my superior agility" -- here Sir Francis jumped upon his chair, 
and
sat upon the back of it -- "to get the better of you.  How do you like the
plan I have proposed?  Does it meet your wishes?"

     "Curse your impudence!" said the admiral, placing his elbows upon the
table, and resting his chin in astonishment upon his two hands.

     "Nay," interrupted Sir Francis, "you challenged me; and, besides, 
you'll
have an equal chance, you know that.  If you succeed in striking me first,
down I go; whereas, if I succeed in striking you first, down you go."

     As he spoke, Sir Francis Varney stretched out his foot, and closed a
small bracket, which held out the flap of the table on which the admiral was
leaning, and, accordingly, down the admiral went, tea-tray and all.

     Mr. Chillingworth ran to help him up, and, when they both recovered 
their
feet, they found they were alone.

                                Chapter LXI.

THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER. -- THE PARTICULARS OF THE SUICIDE AT BANNERWORTH
HALL.


     "Hilloa where the deuce is he?" said the admiral.  "Was there ever such 
a
confounded take-in?"

     "Well, I really don't know," said Mr. Chillingworth; "but it seems to 
me
that he must have gone out of that door that was behind him.  I begin, do 
you
know, admiral, to wish -- "

     "What?"

     "That we had never come here at all; and I think that the sooner we get
out of it the better."

     "Yes; but I am not going to be hoaxed and humbugged in this way.  I 
will
have satisfaction, but not with those confounded scythes and things he talks
about in the dark room.  Give me broad daylight and no favour; yardarm and
yardarm; broadside and broadside; hand-grenades and marling-spikes."

     "Well, but that's what he won't do.  Now, admiral, listen to me."

     "Well, go on; what next?"

     "Come away at once."

     "Oh, you said that before."

     "Yes; but I'm going to say something else.  Look round you. Don't you
think this is a large, scientific-looking room?"

     "What of that?"

     "Why, what if suppose it was to become as dark as the grave, and Varney
was to enter with his scythe, that he talks of, and begin mowing about our
legs."

     "The devil!  Come along!"

     The door at which they entered was at this moment opened, and the old
woman made her appearance.

     "Please, sir," she said, "here's a Mr. Mortimer," in a loud voice.  
"Oh,
Sir Francis ain't here!  Where's he gone, gentlemen?"

     "To the devil!" said the admiral.  "Who may Mr. Mortimer be?"

     There walked past the woman a stout, portly-looking man, well dressed,
but with a very odd look upon his face, in consequence of an obliquity of
vision, which prevented the possibility of knowing which way he was looking.

     "I must see him," he said; "I must see him."

     Mr. Chillingworth started back as if in amazement.

     "Good God!" he cried, "you here?"

     "Confusion!" said Mortimer; "are you Dr. -- Dr. --"

     "Chillingworth."

     "The same.  Hush! there is no occasion to betray -- that is, to state 
my
secret."

     "And mine, too," said Chillingworth.  "But what brings you here?"

     "I cannot and dare not tell you.  Farewell!"

     He turned abruptly, and was leaving the room; but he ran against some 
one
at the entrance, and in another moment Henry Bannerworth, heated and almost
breathless by evident haste, made his appearance.

     "Hilloa! bravo!" cried the admiral; "the more the merrier! Here's a
combined squadron!  Why, how came you here, Mr. Henry Bannerworth?"

     "Bannerworth!" said Mortimer; "is this young man's name Bannerworth?"

     "Yes," said Henry.  "Do you know me, sir?"

     "No, no; only I -- I -- must be off.  Does anyone know anything of Sir
Francis Varney?"

     "We did know something of him," said the admiral, "a little while ago;
but he's taken himself off.  Don't you do so likewise.  If you've got 
anything
to say, stop and say it, like an Englishman."

     "Stuff! stuff!" said Mortimer, impatiently.  "What do you all want 
here?"

     "Why, Sir Francis Varney," said Henry, -- "and I care not if the whole
world heard it -- is the persecutor of my family."

     "How? in what way?"

     "He has the reputation of a vampyre; he has hunted me and mine from 
house
and home."

     "Indeed!"

     "Yes," cried Dr. Chillingworth; "and, by some means or another, he 
seems
determined to get possession of Bannerworth Hall."

     "Well, gentlemen," said Mortimer, "I promise you that I will inquire 
into
this.  Mr. Chillingworth, I did not expect to meet you.  Perhaps the least 
we
say to each other is, after all, the better."

     "Let me ask but one question," said Dr. Chillingworth, imploringly.

     "Ask it."

     "Did he live after -- "

     "Hush! he did."

     "You always told me to the contrary."

     "Yes; I had an object; the game is up.  Farewell; and, gentlemen, as I 
am
making my exit, let me do so with a sentiment: -- Society at large is 
divided
into two great classes."

     "And what may they be?" said the admiral.

     "Those who have been hanged, and those who have not. Adieu!"

     He turned and left the room; and Mr. Chillingworth sunk into a chair, 
and
said, in a low voice, --

     "It is uncommonly true; and I've found out an acquaintance among the
former."

     "D--n it! you seem all mad," said the admiral.  "I can't make out what
you are about.  How come you here, Mr. Henry Bannerworth?"

     "By mere accident I heard," said Henry, "that you were keeping watch 
and
ward in the Hall.  Admiral, it was cruel, and not well done of you, to 
attempt
such an enterprise without acquainting me with it.  Did you suppose for a
moment that I, who had the greatest interest in this affair, would have 
shrunk
from danger, if danger there be; or lacked perseverance, if that quality 
were
necessary in carrying out any plan by which the safety and honour of my 
family
might be preserved?"

     "Nay, now, my young friend," said Mr. Chillingworth.

     "May, sir; but I take it ill that I should have been kept out of this
affair; and it should have been sedulously, as it were, kept a secret from
me."

     "Let him go on as he likes," said the admiral; "boys will be boys.  
After
all, you know, doctor, it's my affair, and not yours.  Let him say what he
likes; where's the odds?  It's of no consequence."

     "I do not expect, Admiral Bell," said Henry, "that it is to you; but it
is to me."

     "Psha!"

     "Respecting you, sir, as I do -- "

     "Gammon!"

     "I must confess that I did expect -- "

     "What you didn't get; therefore, there's an end of that. Now, I tell 
you
what, Henry, Sir Francis Varney is within this house; at least, I have 
reason
to suppose so."

     "Then," exclaimed Henry, impetuously, "I will wring from him answers to
various questions which concern my peace and happiness."

     "Please, gentlemen," said the woman Deborah, making her appearance, 
"Sir
Francis Varney has gone out, and he says I'm to show you all the door, as 
soon
as it is convenient for you all to walk out of it."

     "I feel convinced," said Mr. Chillingworth, "that it will be a useless
search now to attempt to find Sir Francis Varney here.  Let me beg of you 
all
to come away; and believe me that I do not speak lightly, or with a view to
get you from here, when I say, that after I have heard something from you,
Henry, which I shall ask you to relate to me, painful though it may be, I
shall be able to suggest some explanation of many things which appear at
present obscure, and to put you in a course of freeing you from difficulties
which surround you, which, Heaven knows, I little expected I should have it 
in
my power to propose to any of you."

     "I will follow your advice, Mr. Chillingworth," said Henry; "for I have
always found that it has been dictated by good feeling as well as correct
judgment.  Admiral Bell, you will oblige me much by coming away with me now
and at once."

     "Well," remarked the admiral, "if the doctor has really something to 
say,
it alters the appearance of things, and, of course, I have no objection."

     Upon this, the whole three of them immediately left the place, and it 
was
evident that Mr. Chillingworth had something of an uncomfortable character
upon his mind.  He was unusually silent and reserved, and, when he did 
speak,
he seemed rather inclined to turn the conversation upon indifferent topics,
than to add anything more to what he had said upon the deeply interesting 
one
which held so foremost a place in all their minds.

     "How is Flora, now," he asked of Henry, "since her removal?"

     "Anxious still," said Henry; "but, I think, better."

     "That is well.  I perceive that, naturally, we are all three walking
towards Bannerworth Hall, and, perhaps, it is as well that on that spot I
should ask of you, Henry, to indulge me with a confidence such as, under
ordinary circumstances, I should not at all feel myself justified in 
requiring
of you."

     "To what does it relate?" said Henry.  "You may be assured, Mr.
Chillingworth, that I am not likely to refuse my confidence to you, whom I
have so much reason to respect as an attached friend of myself and my 
family."

     "You will not object, likewise, I hope," added Mr. Chillingworth, "to
extend that confidence to Admiral Bell; for, as you well know, a truer and
more warm-hearted man than he does not exist."

     "What do you expect for that, doctor?" said the admiral.

     "There is nothing," said Henry, "that I could relate at all, that I
should shrink from relating to Admiral Bell."

     "Well, my boy," said the admiral, "and all I can reply to that is, you
are quite right; for there can be nothing that you need shrink from telling
me, so far as regards the fact of trusting me with it goes."

     "I am assured of that."

     "A British officer, once pledging his word, prefers death to breaking 
it.
Whatever you wish kept secret in the communication you make to me, say so, 
and
it will never pass my lips."

     "Why, sir, the fact is," said Henry, "that what I am about to relate to
you consists of much of secrets as of matters which would be painful to my
feelings to talk of more than may be absolutely required."

     "I understand you."

     "Let me, for a moment," said Mr. Chillingworth, "put myself right.  I 
do
not suspect, Mr. Henry Bannerworth, that you fancy I ask you to make a 
recital
of circumstances which must be painful to you, from any idle motive.  But 
let
me declare that I have now a stronger impulse, which induces me to wish to
hear from your own lips those matters which popular rumour may have greatly
exaggerated or vitiated."

     "It is scarcely possible," remarked Henry, sadly, "that popular rumour
should exaggerate the facts."

     "Indeed!"

     "No.  They are, unhappily, of themselves, in their bare truthfulness, 
so
full of all that can be grevious to those who are in any way connected with
them, that there needs no exaggeration to invest them with more terror, or
with more of that sadness which must ever belong to a recollection of them 
in
my mind."

     In suchlike discourse as this, the time was passed, until Henry
Bannerworth and his friends once more reached the Hall, from which he, with
his family, had so recently removed, in consequence of the fearful 
persecution
to which they had been subjected.

     They passed again into the garden which they all knew so well, and then
Henry paused and looked around him with a deep sigh.

     In answer to an inquiring glance from Mr. Chillingworth, he said, --

     "Is it not strange, now, that I should have only been away from here a
space of time which may be counted by hours, and yet all seems changed.  I
could almost fancy that years had elapsed since I had looked at it."

     "Oh," remarked the doctor, "time is always by the imagination measured 
by
the number of events which are crowded into a given space of it, and not by
its actual duration. Come into the house; there you will find all just as 
you
left it, Henry, and you can tell us your story at leisure."

     "The air," said Henry, "about here is fresh and pleasant. Let us sit 
down
in the summer-house yonder, and there I will tell you all.  It has a local
interest, too, connected with this tale."

     This was agreed to, and, in a few moments, the admiral, Mr.
Chillingworth, and Henry were seated in the same summer-house which had
witnessed the strange interview between Sir Francis Varney and Flora
Bannerworth, in which he had induced her to believe that he felt for the
distress he had occasioned her, and was strongly impressed with the 
injustice
of her sufferings.

     Henry was silent for some few moments, and then he said, with a deep
sigh, as he looked mournfully around him, --

     "It was on this spot that my father breathed his last, and hence have I
said that it has a local interest in the tale I have to tell, which makes it
the most fitting place in which to tell it."

     "Oh?" said the admiral; "he died here, did he?"

     "Yes, where you are now sitting."

     "Very good; I have seen many a brave man die in my time, and I hope to
see a few more; although, I grant you, the death in the heat of conflict, 
and
fighting for our country, is a vastly different thing to some shore-going 
mode
of leaving the world."

     "Yes," said Henry, as if pursuing his own meditation, rather than
listening to the admiral.  "Yes, it was from this precise spot that my 
father
took his last look at the ancient house of his race.  What we can now see of
it, he saw of it with his dying eyes, and many a time I have sat here and
fancied the world of terrible thoughts that must at such a moment have come
across his brain."

     "You might well do so," said the doctor.

     "You see," added Henry, "that from here the fullest view you have of 
any
of the windows of the house is of that of Flora's room, as we have always
called it, because for years she had had it as her chamber; and, when all 
the
vegetation of summer is in its prime, and the vine which you perceive crawls
over this summer-house is full of leaf and fruit, the view is so much 
hindered
that it is difficult, without making an artificial gap in the clustering
foliage, to see anything but the window."

     "So I should imagine," replied Mr. Chillingworth.

     "You, doctor," added Henry, "who know much of my family, need not be 
told
what sort of man my father was."

     "No, indeed."

     "But you, Admiral Bell, who do not know, must be told, and, however
grevious it may be to me to have to say so, I must inform you that he was 
not
a man who would have merited your esteem."

     "Well," said the admiral, "you know, my boy, that can make no 
difference
as regards you in anybody's mind, who has got the brains of an owl.  Every
man's credit, character, and honour, to my thinking, is in his own most
special keeping, and let your father be what he might, or who he might, I do
not see that any conduct of his ought to raise upon your cheek the flush of
shame, or cost you more uneasiness than ordinary good feeling dictates to 
the
errors and feelings of a fellow creature."

     "If all the world," said Henry, "would take such liberal and
comprehensive views as you do, admiral, it would be much happier than it is;
but such is not the case, and people are but too apt to blame one person for
the evil that another has done."

     "Ah, but," said Mr. Chillingworth, "it so happens that those are the
people whose opinions are of the very least consequence."

     "There is some truth in that," said Henry, sadly; "but, however, let me
proceed; since I have to tell the tale, I could wish it over.  My father,
then, Admiral Bell, although a man not tainted in early life with vices,
became, by the force of bad associates, and a sort of want of congeniality 
and
sentiment that sprang up between him and my mother, plunged into all the
excesses of his age.

     These excesses were all of that character which the most readily lay 
hold
strongly of an unreflecting mind, because they all presented themselves in 
the
garb of sociality.

     The wine cup is drained in the name of good fellowship; money which is
wanted for legitimate purposes is squandered under the mask of a noble and
free generosity; and all that the small imagination of a number of persons 
of
perverted intellects could enable them to do, has been done, from time to
time, to impart a kind of lustre to intemperance and all its dreadful and
criminal consequences.

     My father, having once got into the company of what he considered wits
and men of spirit, soon became thoroughly vitiated.  He was almost the only
one of the set among whom he passed what he considered his highly convivial
existence, who was really worth anything, pecuniarily speaking.  There were
some among them who might have been respectable men, and perchance carved
their way to fortune, as well as some others who had started in life with 
good
patrimonies; but he, my father, at the time he became associated with them,
was the only one, as I say, who, to use a phrase I have heard myself from 
his
lips concerning them, had got a feather to fly with.

     The consequence of this was, that his society, merely for the sake of 
the
animal gratification of drinking at his expense was courted, and he was much
flattered, all of which he laid to the score of his own merits, which had 
been
found out, and duly appreciated by these _bon vivants_, while he considered
that the grave admonitions of his real friends proceeded from nothing in the
world but downright envy and malice.

     Such a state of things as this could not last very long. The associates
of my father wanted money as well as wine, so they introduced him to the
gaming-table, and he became fascinated with the fearful vice to an extent
which predicted his own destruction and the ruin of every one who was in in
any way dependent upon him.

     He could not absolutely sell Bannerworth Hall, unless I had given my
consent, which I refused; but he accumulated debt upon debt, and from time 
to
time stripped the mansion of all its most costly contents.

     With various mutations of fortune, he continued this horrible and 
baneful
career for a long time, until, at last, he found himself utterly and
irretrievably ruined, and he came home in an agony of despair, being so 
weak,
and utterly ruined in constitution, that he kept his bed for many days.

     It appeared, however, that something occurred at this juncture which 
gave
him actually, or all events awakened a hope that he should possess some 
money,
and be again in a position to try his fortune at the gaming-table.

     He rose, and, fortifying himself once more with the strong stimulant of
wine and spirits, he left his home, and was absent for about two months.

     What occurred to him during that time we none of us ever knew, but late
one night he came home, apparently much flurried in manner, and seeming as 
if
something had happened to drive him half mad.

     He would not speak to any one, but he shut himself up the whole of the
night in the chamber where hangs the portrait that bears so strong a
resemblance to Sir Francis Varney, and there he remained till the morning,
when he emerged, and said briefly that he intended to leave the country.

     He was in a most fearful state of nervousness, and my mother tells me
that he shook like one in an ague, and started at every little sound that
occurred in the house, and glared about him so wildly that it was horrible 
to
see him, or to sit in the same apartment with him.

     She says that the whole morning passed on in this way till a letter 
came
to him, the contents of which appeared to throw him into a perfect 
convulsion
of terror, and he retired again to the room with the portrait, where he
remained some hours, and then he emerged, looking like a ghost, so 
dreadfully
pale and haggard was he.

     He walked into the garden here, and was seen to sit down in this 
summer-
house, and fix his eyes upon the window of that apartment.

     Henry paused for a few moments, and then he added --

     You will excuse me from entering upon any details of what next ensued 
in
the melancholy history.  My father here committed suicide.  He was found
dying, and all the words he spoke were, "The money is hidden!"  Death 
claimed
his victim, and, with a convulsive spasm, he resigned his spirit, leaving 
what
he had intended to say hidden in the oblivion of the grave.

     "That was an odd affair," said the admiral.

     "It was, indeed.  We have all pondered deeply, and the result was, 
that,
upon the whole, we were inclined to come to an opinion that the words he so
uttered were but the result of the mental disturbance that at such a moment
might well be supposed to be ensuing in the mind, and that they related 
really
to no foregone fact any more than some incoherent words uttered by a man in 
a
dream might be supposed to do so."

     "It may be so."

     "I do not mean," remarked Mr. Chillingworth, "for one moment to attempt
to dispute, Henry, the rationality of such an opinion as you have just given
utterance to; but you forget that another circumstance occurred, which gave 
a
colour to the words used by your father."

     "Yes; I know to what you allude."

     "Be so good at to state it to the admiral."

     "I will.  On the evening of that same day there came a man here, who, 
in
seeming ignorance of what had occurred, although by that time it was well
known to all the neighbourhood, asked to see my father.

     "Upon being told that he was dead, he started back, either with well
acted or with real surprise, and seemed to be immensely chagrined.  He then
demanded to know if he had left any disposition of his property; but he got 
no
information, and departed muttering the most diabolical oaths and curses 
that
can be imagined.  He mounted his horse, for he had ridden to the Hall, and 
his
last words were, as I am told --

     "'Where, in the name of all that's damnable, can he have put the 
money?'"

     "And did you never find out who this man was?" asked the admiral.

     "Never."

     "It is an odd affair."

     "It is," said Mr. Chillingworth, "and full of mystery. The public mind
was much taken up at the time with some other matters, or it would have made
the death of Mr. Bannerworth the subject of more prolific comment than it 
did.
As it was, however, a great deal was said upon the subject, and the whole
county was in a state of commotion for weeks afterwards."

     "Yes," said Henry; "it so happened that about that very time a murder 
was
committed in the neighbourhood of London, which baffled all the exertions of
the authorities to discover the perpetrators of.  It was the murder of Lord
Lorne."

     "Oh!  I remember," said the admiral; "the newspapers were full of it 
for
a long time."

     "They were; and more so, as Mr. Chillingworth says, the more exciting
interest which that affair created drew off public attention, in a great
measure, from my father's suicide, and we did not suffer so much from public
remark and from impertinent curiosity as might have been expected."

     "And, in addition," said Mr. Chillingworth, and he changed colour a
little as he spoke, "there was an execution shortly afterwards."

     "Yes," said Henry, "there was."

     "The execution of a man named Angerstein," added Mr. Chillingworth "for 
a
highway robbery, attended with the most brutal violence."

     "True; all the affairs of that period of time are strongly impressed 
upon
my mind," said Henry; "but you do not seem well, Mr. Chillingworth."

     "Oh, yes; I am quite well -- you are mistaken."

     Both the admiral and Henry looked scrutinizingly at the doctor, who
certainly appeared to them to be labouring under some great mental 
excitement,
which he found it almost beyond his power to repress.

     "I tell you what it is, doctor," said the admiral; "I don't pretend, 
and
never did, to see further through a tar-barrel than my neighbours; but I can
see far enough to feel convinced that you have got something on your mind, 
and
that it somehow concerns this affair."

     "Is it so?" said Henry.

     "I cannot if I would," said Mr. Chillingworth; "and I may with truth 
add,
that I would not, if I could, hide from you that I have something on my mind
connected with this affair; but let me assure you it would be premature of 
me
to tell you of it."

     "Premature be d----d!" said the admiral; "out with it."

     "Nay, nay, dear sir; I am not now in a position to say what is passing
through my mind."

     "Alter your position, then, and be blowed!" cried Jack Pringle, 
suddenly
stepping forward, and giving the doctor such a push, that he nearly went
through one of the sides of the summer-house.

     "Why, you scoundrel!" cried the admiral, "how came you here?"

     "On my legs," said Jack.  "Do you think nobody wants to know nothing 
but
yourself?  I'm as fond of a yarn as anybody."

     "But if you are," said Mr. Chillingworth, "you had no occasion to come
against me as if you wanted to move a house."

     "You said as you wasn't in a position to say something as I wanted to
hear, so I thought I'd alter it for you."

     "Is this fellow," said the doctor, shaking his head, as he accosted the
admiral, "the most artful or stupid?"

     "A little of both," said Admiral Bell -- "a little of both, doctor.  
He's
a great fool and a great scamp."

     "The same to you," said Jack; "you're another.  I shall hate you
presently, if you go on making yourself so ridiculous. Now, mind, I'll only
give you a trial of another week or so, and if you don't be more purlite in
your d--n language, I'll leave you."

     Away strolled Jack, with his hands in his pockets, towards the house,
while the admiral was half choked with rage, and could only glare after him,
without the ability to say a word.

     Under any other circumstances than the present one of trouble, and
difficulty; and deep anxiety, Henry Bannerworth mush have laughed at these
singular little episodes between Jack and the admiral; but his mind was now 
by
far too much harassed to permit him to do so.

     "Let him go, let him go, my dear sir," said Mr. Chillingworth to the
admiral, who showed some signs of an intention to pursue Jack; "he no doubt
has been drinking again."

     "I'll turn him off the first moment I catch him sober enough to
understand me," said the admiral.

     "Well, well; do as you please; but now let me ask a favour of both of
you."

     "What is it?"

     "That you will leave Bannerworth Hall to me for a week."

     "What for?"

     "I hope to make some discoveries connected with it which shall well
reward you for the trouble."

     "It's no trouble," said Henry; "and for myself, I have amply sufficient
faith, both in your judgment and in your friendship, doctor, to accede to 
any
request which you may make to me."

     "And I," said the admiral.  "Be it so -- be it so.  For one week, you
say?"

     "Yes -- for one week.  I hope, by the end of that time, to have 
achieved
something worth the telling of; and I promise you that, if I am at all
disappointed in my expecting, that I will frankly and freely communicate to
you all I know and all I suspect."

     "Then that's a bargain."

     "It is."

     "And what's to be done at once?"

     "Why, nothing, but to take the greatest possible care that Bannerworth
Hall is not left another hour without some one in it; and in order that such
should be the case, I have to request that you two will remain here until I 
go
to the town, and make preparations for taking quiet possession of it myself,
which I will do in the course of two hours, at most."

     "Don't be longer," said the admiral, "for I am so desperately hungry,
that I shall certainly begin to eat somebody, if you are."

     "Depend upon me."

     "Very well," said Henry; "you may depend we will wait here until you 
come
back."

     The doctor at once hurried from the garden, leaving Henry and the 
admiral
to amuse themselves as best they might, with conjectures as to what he was
really about, until his return.

 Next Time: The Mysterious Meeting in the Ruin Again. -- The Vampyre's 
Attack
 Upon the Constable.




                                Chapter LXII.

THE MYSTERIOUS MEETING IN THE RUIN AGAIN. -- THE VAMPYRE'S ATTACK UPON THE
CONSTABLE.


     It is now necessary that we return once more to that mysterious ruin in
the intricacies of which Varney, when pursued by the mob, had succeeded in
finding a refuge which defied all the exertions which were made for his
discovery.  Our readers must be well aware, that, connected with that ruin,
are some secrets of great importance to our story; and we will now, at the
solemn hour of midnight, take another glance at what is doing within its
recesses.

     At that solemn hour it is not probable that anyone would seek that 
gloomy
place from choice.  Some lover of the picturesque certainly might visit it;
but such was not the inciting cause of the pilgrimage with those who were 
soon
to stand within its gloomy precincts.

     Other motives dictated their presence in that spot -- motives of 
rapine;
peradventure of murder itself.

     As the neighbouring clocks sounded the hour of twelve, and the faint
strokes were born gently on the wind to that isolated ruin, there might have
been seen a tall man standing by the porch of what had once been a large
doorway to some portion of the ruin.

     His form was enveloped in a large cloak, which was of such ample 
material
that he seemed well able to wrap it several times around him, and then leave 
a
considerable portion of it floating idly in the gentle wind.

     He stood as still, as calm, and as motionless as a statue, for a
considerable time, before any degree of impatience began to show itself.  
Then
he took from his pocket a large antique watch, the white face of which just
enabled him to see what the time was, and, in a voice which had in it some
amount of petulance and anger, he said, --

     "Not come yet, and nearly half an hour beyond the time! What can have
detained him?  This is, indeed, trifling with the most important moments of 
a
man's existence."

     Even as he spoke, he heard, from some distance off, the sound of a 
short,
quick footstep.  He bent forwards to listen, and then, in a tone of
satisfaction, he said,--

     "He comes -- he comes!"

     But he who thus waited for some confederate among these dim and old 
grey
ruins, advanced not a step to meet him.  On the contrary, such seemed the
amount of cold-blooded caution which he possessed,  that the nearer the man 
--
who was evidently advancing -- got to the place, the further back did he who
had preceded him shrink into the shadow of the dim and rumbling walls, which
had, for some years now past, seemed to bend to the passing blast, and to be
on the point of yielding to the destroying hand of time.

     And yet, surely he needed not have been so cautious.  Who was likely, 
at
such an hour as that, to come to the ruins, but one who sought it by
appointment?

     And, moreover, the manner of the advancing man should have been quite
sufficient to convince him who waited, that so much caution was unnecessary;
but it was a part and parcel of his nature.

     About three minutes more sufficed to bring the second man to the ruin,
and he, at once, and fearlessly, plunged into its recesses.

     "Who comes?" said the first man, in a deep, hollow voice.

     "He whom you expect," was the reply.

     "Good," he said, and at once he now emerged from his hiding-place, and
they stood together in the nearly total darkness with which the place was
enshrouded; for the night was a cloudy one, and there appeared not a star in
the heavens, to shed its faint light upon the scene below.

     For a few moments they were both silent, for he who had last arrived 
had
evidently made great exertions to reach the spot, and was breathing
laboriously, while he who was there first appeared, from some natural
taciturnity of character, to decline opening the conversation.

     At length the second comer spoke, saying, --

     "I have made some exertion to get here to my time, and yet I am beyond
it, as you are no doubt aware."

     "Yes, yes."

     "Well, such would not have been the case; but yet, I stayed to bring 
you
some news of importance."

     "Indeed!"

     "It is so.  This place, which we have now for some time had as a quiet
and perfectly eligible one of meeting, is about to be invaded by one of 
those
restless, troublesome spirits, who are never happy but when they are
contriving something to the annoyance of others who do not interfere with
them."

     "Explain yourself more fully."

     "I will.  At a tavern in the town, there has happened some strange 
scenes
of violence, in consequence of the general excitement into which the common
people have been thrown upon the dreadful subject of vampyres."

     "Well."

     "The consequence is, that numerous arrests have taken place, and the
places of confinement for offenders against the laws are now full of those
whose heated and angry imaginations have induced them to take violent steps 
to
discover the reality or the falsehood of rumours which so much affected 
them,
their wives, and their families, that they feared to lie down to their 
night's
repose."

     The other laughed a short, hollow, restless sort of laugh, which had 
not
one particle of real mirth in it.

     "Go on -- go on," he said.  "What did they do?"

     "Immense excesses have been committed; but what made me, first of all,
stay beyond my time, was that I overheard a man declare his intentions this
night, from twelve till the morning, and for some nights to come, to hold
watch and ward for the vampyre."

     "Indeed!"

     "Yes.  He did but stay, at the earnest solicitation of his comrades, to
take yet another glass, ere he came upon his expedition."

     "He must be met.  The idiot! what business is it of his?"

     "There are always people who will make everything their business, 
whether
it be so or not."

     "There are.  Let us retire further into the recesses of the ruin, and
there consider as well what is to be done regarding more important affairs, 
as
with this rash intruder here."

     They both walked for some twenty paces, or so, right into the ruin, and
then he who had been there first, said, suddenly, to his companion, --

     "I am annoyed, although the feeling reaches no farther than annoyance,
for I have a natural love of mischief, to think that my reputation has 
spread
so widely, and made so much noise."

     "Your reputation as a vampyre, Sir Francis Varney, you mean?"

     "Yes; but there is no occasion for you to utter my name aloud, even 
here
where we are alone together."

     "It came out unawares."

     "Unawares!  Can it be possible that you have so little command over
yourself as to allow a name to come from your lips unawares?"

     "Sometimes."

     "I am surprised."

     "Well, it cannot be helped.  What do you now propose to do?"

     "Nay, you are my privy councillor.  Have you no deep-laid, artful 
project
in hand?  Can you not plan and arrange something which may yet have the 
effect
of accomplishing what at first seemed so very simple, but which has, from 
one
unfortunate circumstance and another, become full of difficulty and pregnant
with all sorts of dangers?"

     "I must confess I have no plan."

     "I listen with astonishment."

     "Nay, now, you are jesting."

     "When did you ever hear of me jesting?"

     "Not often, I admit.  But you have a fertile genius, and I have always,
myself, found it easier to be the executive than to plan an elaborate course
of action for others."

     "Then you throw it all on me?"

     "I throw a weight, naturally enough, upon the shoulders which I think 
the
best adapted to sustain it."

     "Be it so, then -- be it so."

     "You are, I presume, from what you say, provided with a scheme of 
action
which shall present better hopes of success, at less risk, I hope.  Look 
what
great danger we have already passed through."

     "Yes, we have."

     "I pray you avoid that in the next campaign."

     "It is not the danger that annoys and troubles me, but it is that,
notwithstanding it, the object is as far off as ever from being attained."

     "And not only so, but as is invariably the case under such 
circumstance,
we have made it more difficult of execution because we have put those upon
their guard thoroughly who are the most likely to oppose us."

     "We have -- we have."

     "And placed the probability of success afar off indeed."

     "And yet I have set my life upon the case, and I will stand the hazard. 
I tell you I will accomplish this object, or I will perish in the attempt."

     "You are too enthusiastic."

     "Not at all.  Nothing has been ever done, the execution of which was
difficult, without enthusiasm.  I will do what I intend, or Bannerworth Hall
shall become a heap of ruins, where fire shall do its worst work of
devastation, and I will myself find a grave in the midst."

     "Well, I quarrel with no man for chalking out the course he intends to
pursue, but what do you mean to do with the prisoner below here?"

     "Kill him."

     "What?"

     "I say kill him.  Do you not understand me?"

     "I do, indeed."

     "When everything else is secured, and when the whole of that which I so
much court, and which I will have, is in my possession, I will take his 
life,
or you shall.  Ay, you are just the man for such a deed.  A smooth-faced,
specious sort of man are you, and you like not danger.  There will be none 
in
taking the life of a man who is chained to the floor of a dungeon."

     "I know not why," said the other, "you take a pleasure on this 
particular
night, of all others, in saying all you can which you think will be 
offensive
to me."

     "Now, how you wrong me.  This is the reward of confidence."

     "I don't want such confidence."

     "Why, you surely don't want me to flatter you."

     "No; but -- "

     "Psha!  Hark you.  That admiral is the great stumbling- block in my 
way. 
I should ere this have had undisturbed possession of Bannerworth Hall but 
for
him.  He must be got out of the way somehow."

     "A short time will tire him out of watching.  He is one of those men of
impulse who soon become wearied of inaction."

     "Ay, and then the Bannerworths return to the Hall."

     "It may be so."

     "I am certain of it.  We have been out-generalled in this matter,
although I grant we did all that men could do to give us success."

     "In what way would you get rid of this troublesome admiral?"

     "I scarcely know.  A letter from his nephew might, if well put 
together,
get him to London."

     "I doubt it.  I hate him mortally.  He has offended me more than once
most grievously."

     "I know it.  He saw through you."

     "I do not give him so much credit.  He is a suspicious man, and a vain
and a jealous one."

     "And yet he saw through you.  Now, listen to me.  You are completely at
fault, and have no plan of operations whatever in your mind.  What I want 
you
to do is, to disappear from the neighborhood for a while, and so will I.  As
for our prisoner here below, I cannot see what else can be done with him 
than
-- than -- "

     "Than what?  Do you hesitate?"

     "I do."

     "Then what is it you were about to say?"

     "I cannot but feel that all we have done, hitherto, as regards this 
young
prisoner of ours, has failed.  He has, with a determined obstinacy, set at
naught, as well you know, all threats."

     "He has."

     "He has refused to do one act which could in any way aid me in my
objects.  In fact, from the first to the last, he has been nothing but an
expense and an encumbrance to us both."

     "And yet, although you, as well as I, know of a marvellously ready way 
of
getting rid of such encumbrances, I must own that I shrink with more than a
feeling of reluctance from the murder of the youth."

     "You contemplated it, then?" asked the other.

     "No; I cannot be said to have contemplated it.  That is not the proper
sort of expression to use."

     "What is then?"

     "To contemplate a deed seems to me to have some close connexion to the
will to do it."

     "And you have no such wish?"

     "I have no such wish, and what is more I will not do it."

     "Then that is sufficient; and the only question that remains for you to
consider is, what you will do.  It is far easier in all enterprises to 
decide
upon what we will not do, than upon what we will.  For my own part I must 
say
that I can perceive no mode of extricating ourselves from this involvement
with anything like safety."

     "Then it must be done with something like danger."

     "As you please."

     "You say so, and your words bear a clear enough significance; but from
your tone I can guess how much you are dissatisfied with the aspect of
affairs."

     "Dissatisfied!"

     "Yes; I say, dissatisfied.  Be frank, and own that which it is in vain 
to
conceal from me.  I know you too well; arch hypocrite as you are, and fully
capable of easily deceiving many, you cannot deceive me."

     "I really cannot understand you."

     "Then I will take care that you shall."

     "How?"

     "Listen.  I will not have the life of Charles Holland taken."

     "Who wishes to take it?"

     "You."

     "There, indeed, you wrong me.  Unless  you yourself thought that such 
an
act was imperatively called for by the state of affairs, do you think that I
would needlessly bring down upon my head the odium as well as the danger of
such a deed?  No, no. Let him live, if you are willing; he may live a 
thousand
years for all I care."

     "'Tis well.  I am, mark me, not only willing, but I am determined that 
he
shall live so far as we are concerned.  I can respect the courage that, even
when he considered that his life was at stake, enabled him to say no to a
proposal which was cowardly and dishonourable, although it went far to the
defeat of my own plans and has involved me in much trouble."

     "Hush! hush!"

     "What is it?"

     "I fancy I hear a foot step."

     "Indeed; that were a novelty in such a place as this."

     "And yet not more than I expected.  Have you forgotten what I told you
when I reached here to-night after the appointed hour?"

     "Truly; I had for the moment.  Do you think then that the footstep 
which
now meets our ears, is that of the adventurer who boasted that he could keep
watch for the vampyre?"

     "In faith do I.  What is to be done with such a meddling fool?"

     "He ought certainly to be taught not to be so fond of interfering with
other people's affairs."

     "Certainly."

     "Perchance the lesson will not be wholly thrown away upon others.  It 
may
be worth while to take some trouble with the pot valiant fellow, and let him
spread his news so as to stop any one else from being equally venturous and
troublesome."

     "A good thought."

     "Shall it be done?"

     "Yes; if you will arrange that which shall accomplish such a result."

     "Be it so.  The moon rises."

     "It does."

     "Ah, already I fancy I see a brightening of the air as if the mellow
radiance of the queen of night were already quietly diffusing itself
throughout the realms of space.  Come further within the ruins."

     They both walked further among the crumbling walls and fragments of
columns with which the place abounded.  As they did so they paused now and
then to listen, and more than once they both heard plainly the sound of
certain footsteps outside the once handsome and spacious building.

     Varney, the vampyre, who had been holding this conversation with no 
other
than Marchdale, smiled as he, in a whispered voice, told the latter what to 
do
in order to frighten away from the place the foolhardy man who thought that,
by himself, he should be able to accomplish anything against the vampyre.

     It was, indeed, a hair-brained expedition, for whether Sir Francis 
Varney
was really so awful and preternatural a being as so many concurrent
circumstances would seem to proclaim, or not, he was not a likely being to
allow himself to be conquered by any one individual, let his powers or his
courage be what they might.

     What induced this man to become so venturesome we shall now proceed to
relate, as well as what kind of reception he got in the old ruins, which,
since the mysterious disappearance of Sir Francis Varney within their
recesses, had possessed so increased a share of interest and attracted so 
much
popular attention and speculation.

 Next Time: The Guests at the Inn, and the Story of the Dead Uncle.




                               Chapter LXIII.

THE GUESTS AT THE INN, AND THE STORY OF THE DEAD UNCLE.


     As had been truly stated by Mr. Marchdale, who now stands out in his 
true
colours to the reader as the confidant and abettor of Sir Francis Varney,
there had assembled on that evening a curious and gossipping party at the 
inn
where such dreadful proceedings had taken place, we have already duly and at
length recorded.

     It was not very likely that, on that evening, or for many and many an
evening to come, the conversation in the parlour of the inn would be upon 
any
other subject than that of the vampyre.

     Indeed, the strange, mysterious, and horrible circumstances which had
occurred bade fair to be gossipping stock in trade for many a year.

     Never before had a subject presenting so many curious features arisen. 
Never, within the memory of that personage who is supposed to know 
everything
had there occurred any circumstances in the county, or set of circumstances,
which afforded such abundant scope for conjecture and speculation.

     Everybody might have his individual opinion, and be just as likely to 
be
right as his neighbours; and the beauty of the affair was, that such was the
interest of the subject itself, that there was sure to be a kind of 
reflected
interest with eery surmise that at all bore upon it.

     On this particular night, when Marchdale was prowling about, gathering
what news he could, in order that he might carry it to the vampyre, a more
than usually strong muster of the gossips of the town took place.

     Indeed, all of any note in the talking way were there, with the 
exception
of one, and he was in the county gaol, being one of the prisoners 
apprehended
by the military when they made the successful attack upon the lumber-room of
the inn, after the dreadful desecration of the dead which had taken place.

     The landlord of the inn was likely to make a good thing of it, for
talking makes people thirsty; and he began to consider that a vampyre about
once-a-year would be a good thing for the Blue Lion.

     "It's shocking," said one of the guests; "it's shocking to think of. 
Only last night, I am quite sure I had such a fright that it added at least
ten years to my age."

     "A fright!" said several.

     "I believe I speak English -- I said a fright."

     "Well, but had it anything to do with the vampyre?"

     "Everything."

     "Oh! do tell us; do tell us all about it.  How was it?  Did he come to
you?  Go on.  Well, well."

     The first speaker became immediately a very important personage in the
room; and, when he was that, he became at once a very important personage in
his own eyes likewise; and, before he would speak another word, he filled a
fresh pipe, and ordered another mug of ale.

     "It's no use trying to hurry him," said one.

     "No," he said, "it isn't.  I'll tell you in good time what a dreadful
circumstance has made me sixty-three to-day, when I was only fifty-three
yesterday."

     "Was it very dreadful?"

     "Rather.  You wouldn't have survived at all."

     "Indeed!"

     "No.  Now listen.  I went to bed at a quarter after eleven, as usual.  
I
didn't notice anything particular in the room."

     "Did you peep under the bed?"

     "No, I didn't.  Well, as I was a-saying, to bed I went, and I didn't
fasten the door; because, being a very sound sleeper, in case there was a
fire, I shouldn't hear a word of it if I did."

     "No," said another.  "I recollect once -- "

     "Be so good as to allow me to finish what I know, before you begin to
recollect anything, if you please.  As I was saying, I didn't lock the door,
but I went to bed.  Somehow or another, I did not feel at all comfortable, 
and
I tossed about, first on one side, and then on the other; but it was all in
vain; I only got, every moment, more and more fidgetty."

     "And did you think of the vampyre?" said one of the listeners.

     "I thought of nothing else till I heard my clock, which is on the 
landing
of the stairs above my bed-room, begin to strike twelve."

     "Ah! I like to hear a clock sound in the night," said one; "it puts one
in mind of the rest of the world, and lets one know one isn't all alone."

     "Very good.  The striking of the clock I should not at all have 
objected
to; but it was what followed that did the business."

     "What, what?"

     "Fair and softly; fair and softly.  Just hand me a light, Mr. Sprigs, 
if
you please.  I'll tell you all, gentlemen, in a moment or two."

     With the most provoking deliberation, the speaker re-lit his pipe, 
which
had gone out while he was talking, and then, after a few whiffs, to assure
himself that its contents had thoroughly ignited, he resumed --

     "No sooner had the last sound of it died away, than I heard something 
on
the stairs."

     "Yes, yes."

     "It was as if some man had given his foot a hard blow against one of 
the
stairs; and he would have needed to have had a heavy boot on to do it.  I
started up in bed and listened, as you may well suppose, not in the most
tranquil state of mind, and then I heard an odd, gnawing sort of noise, and
then another dab upon one of the stairs."

     "How dreadful!"

     "It was.  What to do I knew not, or what to think, except that the
vampyre had, by some means, got in at the attic window, and was coming down
stairs to my room.  That seemed the most likely.  Then there was another
groan, and then another heavy step; and, as they were evidently coming 
towards
my door, I felt accordingly, and got out of bed, not knowing hardly whether 
I
was on my head or my heels, to try and lock my door."

     "Ah, to be sure."

     "Yes; that was all very well, if I could have done it; but a man in 
such
a state of mind as I was in is not a very sharp hand at doing anything.  I
shook from head to foot.  The room was very dark, and I couldn't, for a 
moment
or two, collect my senses sufficient really to know which way the door lay."

     "What a situation!"

     "It was.  Dab, dab, dab, came these horrid footsteps, and there was I
groping about the room in an agony.  I heard them coming nearer and nearer 
to
my door.  Another moment, and they must have reached it, when my hand struck
against the lock."

     "What an escape!"

     "No, it was not."

     "No?"

     "No, indeed.  The key was on the outside, and you may well guess I was
not over and above disposed to open the door to get at it."

     "No, no."

     "I felt regularly bewildered, I can tell you; it seemed to me as if the
very devil himself was coming down stairs hopping all the way upon one leg."

     "How terrific!"

     "I felt my senses almost leaving me; but I did what I could to hold the
door shut just as I heard the strange step come from the last stair on to 
the
landing.  Then there was a horrid sound, and some one began trying the lock 
of
my door."

     "What a moment!"

     "Yes, I can tell you it was a moment.  Such a moment as I don't wish to
go through again.  I held the door as close as I could, and did not speak.  
I
tried to cry out help and murder, but I could not; my tongue stuck to the 
roof
of my mouth, and my strength was fast failing me."

     "Horrid, horrid!"

     "Take a drop of ale."

     "Thank you.  Well, I don't think this went on above two or three 
minutes,
and all the while some one tried might and main to push open the door.  My
strength left me all at once; I had only time to stagger back a step or two,
and then, as the door opened, I fainted away."

     "Well, well!"

     "Ah, you wouldn't have said well, if you had been there, I can tell 
you."

     "No; but what become of you.  What happened next?  How did it end?  
What
was it?"

     "Why, what exactly happened next after I fainted I cannot tell you; but
the first thing I saw when I recovered was a candle."

     "Yes, yes."

     "And then a crowd of people."

     "Ah, ah!"

     "And then Dr. Webb."

     "Gracious!"

     "And Mrs. Bulk, my housekeeper.  I was in my own bed, and when I opened
my eyes I heard Dr. Webb say, --

     "'He will be better soon.  Can no one form any idea of what it is all
about.  Some sudden fright surely alone could have produced such an effect.'

     "'The Lord have mercy upon me!' said I.

     "Upon this everybody who had been called in got round the bed, and 
wanted
to know what had happened; but I said not a word of it; but turning to Mrs.
Bulk, I asked her how it was she found out I had fainted.

     "'Why, sir,' says she, 'I was coming up to bed as softly as I could,
because I knew you had gone to rest some time before.  The clock was 
striking
twelve, and as I went past it some of my clothes, I suppose, caught the 
large
weight, but it was knocked off, and down the stairs it rolled, going with 
such
a lump from one to the other, and I couldn't catch it because it rolled so
fast, that I made sure you would be awakened; so I came down to tell you 
what
it was, and it was some time before I could get your room door open, and 
when
I did I found you out of bed and insensible.'"

     There was a general look of disappointment when this explanation was
given, and one said, --

     "Then it was not the vampire?"

     "Certainly not."

     "And, after all, only a clock weight."

     "That's about it."

     "Why didn't you tell us about that at first?"

     "Because that would have spoilt the story."

     There was a general murmur of discontent, and, after a few moments one
man said, with some vivacity, --

     "Well, although our friend's vampyre has turned out, after all, to be
nothing but a confounded clock-weight, there's no disputing the fact about 
Sir
Francis Varney being a vampyre, and not a clock-weight."

     "Very true -- very true."

     "And what's to be done to rid the town of such a man?"

     "Oh, don't call him a man."

     "Well, a monster."

     "Ah, that's more like.  I tell you what, sir, if you had got a light,
when you first heard the noise in your room, and gone out to see what it 
was,
you would have spared yourself much fright."

     "Ah, no doubt; it's always easy afterwards to say, if you had done 
this,
and if you had done the other, so and so would have been the effect; but 
there
is something about the hour of midnight that makes men tremble."

     "Well," said one, who had not yet spoken, "I don't see why twelve at
night should be a whit more disagreeable than twelve at day."

     "Don't you?"

     "Not I."

     "Now, for instance, many a party of pleasure goes to that old ruin 
where
Sir Francis Varney so unaccountably disappeared in broad daylight.  But is
there nay one here who would go to it alone, and at midnight?"

     "Yes."

     "Who?"

     "I would."

     "What! and after what has happened as regards the vampyre in connection
with it?"

     "Yes, I would."

     "I'll bet you twenty shillings you won't."

     "And I -- and I," cried several.

     "Well, gentlemen," said the man, who certainly shewed no signs of fear,
"I will go, and not only will I go and take all your bets, but, if I do meet
the vampyre; then I'll do my best to take him prisoner."

     "And when will you go?"

     "To-night," he cried, and he sprang to his feet; "hark ye all, I don't
believe one word about vampyre.  I'll go at once; it's getting late, and let
any one of you, in order that you may be convinced I haver been to the 
place,
give me any article, which I will hide among the ruins; and tell you where 
to
find it to-morrow in broad daylight."

     "Well," said one, "that's fair, Tom Eccles.  Here's a handkerchief of
mine; I should know it again among a hundred others."

     "Agreed; I'll leave it in the ruins."

     The wagers were fairly agreed upon; several handkerchiefs were handed 
to
Tom Eccles; and at eleven o'clock he fairly started, through the murky
darkness of the night, to the old ruin where Sir Francis Varney and 
Marchdale
were holding their most unholy conference.

     It is one thing to talk and to accept wagers in the snug parlour of an
inn, and another to go alone across a tract of country wrapped in the 
profound
stillness of night to an ancient ruin which, in addition to the natural 
gloom
which might well be supposed to surround it, has superadded associations 
which
are anything but of a pleasant character.

     Tom Eccles, as he was named, was one of those individuals who act 
greatly
from impulse.  He was certainly not a coward, and, perhaps, really as free
from superstition as most persons, but he was human, and consequently he had
nerves, and he had likewise imagination.

     He went to his house first before he started on his errand to the 
ruins. 
It was to get a horse-pistol which he had, and which he duly loaded and 
placed
in his pocket.  Then he wrapped himself up in a great-coat, and with the air
of a man quite determined upon something desperate he left the town.

     The guests at the inn looked after him as he walked from the door of 
that
friendly establishment, and some of them, as they saw his resolved aspect,
began to quake for the amount of the wagers they had laid upon his non-
success.

     However, it was resolved among them, that they would stay until half-
past
twelve, in the expectation of his return, before they separated.

     To while away the time, he who had been so facetious about his story of
the clock-weight, volunteered to tell what happened to a friend of his who
went to take possession of some family property which he became possessed of
as heir-at-law to an uncle who had died without a will, having an 
illegitimate
family unprovided for in every shape.

     "Ah! nobody cares for other people's illegitimate children, and, if 
their
parents don't provide for them, why, the workhouse is open for them, just as
if they were something different from other people."

     "So they are; if their parents don't take care of them, and provide for
them, nobody else will, as you say, neighbour, except when they have a Fitz
put to their name, which tells you they are royal bastards, and of course
unlike anybody else's."

     "But go on -- let's know all about it; we sha'n't hear what he has got 
to
say at all, at this rate."

     "Well, as I was saying, or about to say, the nephew, as soon as he 
heard
his uncle was dead, comes and claps his seal upon everything in the chouse."

     "But, could he do so?" inquired one of the guests.

     "I don't see what was to hinder him," replied a third.  "He could do 
so,
certainly."

     "But there was a son, and, as I take it, a son's nearer than a nephew 
any
day."

     "But the son is illegitimate."

     "Legitimate, or illegitimate, a son's a son; don't bother me about
distinction of that sort; why, now, there was old Weatherbit -- "

     "Order, order."

     "Let's hear the tale."

     "Very good, gentlemen, I'll go on, if I ain't to be interrupted; but 
I'll
say this, that an illegitimate son is no son, in the eyes  of the law; or at
most he's an accident, quite, and ain't what he is, and so can't inherit."

     "Well, that's what I call making matters plain," said one of the 
guests,
who took his pipe from his mouth to make room for the remark; "now that is
what I likes."

     "Well, as I have proved then," resumed the speaker, "the nephew was the
heir, and into the house he would come.  A fine affair it was too -- the
illegitimates looking the color of sloes; but he knew the law, and would 
have
it put in force."

     "Law's law, you know."

     "Uncommonly true that, and the nephew stuck to it like a cobbler to his
last -- he said they should go out, and they did go out; and say what they
would about their natural claims, he would not listen to them, but bundled
them out and out in a pretty short space of time."

     "It was trying to them, mind you, to leave the house they had been born
in with very different expectations to those which now appeared to be their
fate.  Poor things, they looked ruefully enough, and well they might, for
there was a wide world for them, and no prospect of a warm corner."

     "Well, as I was saying, he had them all out, and the house clear to
himself.

     "Now," said he, "I have and open field and no favour.  I don't care for
no -- Eh! what!"

     "There was a sudden knocking, he thought, at the door, and went and
opened it, but nothing was to be seen."

     "Oh, I see -- somebody next door; and if it wasn't it don't matter. 
There's nobody here. I'm alone, and there's plenty of valuables in the 
house. 
That is what I call very good company.  I wouldn't wish for better."

     He turned about, looked over room after room, and satisfied himself 
that
he was alone -- that the house was empty.

     At every room he entered he paused to think over the value -- what it 
was
worth, and that he was a very fortunate man in having dropped into such a 
good
thing."

     "Ah! there's the old boy's secretary, too -- his bureau -- there'll be
something in that that will amuse me mightily; but I don't think I shall sit
up late.  He was a rum old man, to say the least of it -- a very odd sort of
man."  With that he gave himself a shrug, as if some very uncomfortable
feeling had come over him.

     "I'll go to bed early, and get some sleep, and then in daylight I can
look after these papers.  They won't be less interesting in the morning than
they are now."

     There was been some rum stories about the old man, and now the nephew
seemed to think that he might have let the family sleep on the premises for
that night; yes, at that moment he could have found it in his heart to have
paid for all the expense of their keep, had it been possible to have had 
them
back to remain the night.

     But that wasn't possible, for they would not have done it, but sooner
have remained in the streets all night than stay there all night, like so 
many
house-dogs, employed by one who stepped in between them and their father's
goods, which were their inheritance, but for one trifling circumstance -- a
mere ceremony.

     The night came on, and he had lights.  True it was that he had not been
down stairs, only just to have a look.  He could not tell what sort of a 
place
it was; there were a good many odd sort of passages, that seemed to end
nowhere, and others that did.

     There were large doors; but they were all locked, and he had the keys; 
so
he didn't mind, but secured all places that were not fastened.

     He then went up stairs again, and sat down in the room where the bureau
was placed.

     "I'll be bound," said one of the guests, "he was in a bit of a stew,
notwithstanding all his brag."

     "Oh! I don't believe," said another, "that anything done that is
dangerous, or supposed to be dangerous, by the bravest man, is any way 
wholly
without some uncomfortable feelings.  They may not be strong enough to 
prevent
the thing proposed to be done from being done, but they give a disagreeable
sensation to the skin."

     "You have felt it, then?"

     "Ha! ha! ha!"

     "Why, at that time I slept in the churchyard for a wager, I must say I
felt cold all over, as if my skin was walking about me in an uncomfortable
manner."

     "But you won your wager?"

     "I did."

     "And of course you slept there?"

     "To be sure I did."

     "And met with nothing?"

     "Nothing, save a few bumps against the gravestones."

     "Those were hard knocks, I should say."

     They were, I assure you; but I lay there, and slept there, and won my
wager."

     "Would you do it again?"

     "No."

     "And why not?"

     "Because of the rheumatism?"

     "You caught that?"

     "I did; I would give ten times my wager to get rid of them.  I have 
them
very badly."

     "Come, order, order -- the tale; let's hear the end of that, since it 
has
begun."

     "With all my heart.  Come, neighbour."

     "Well, as I said, he was fidgetty; but yet he was not a man to be very
easily frightened or overcome, for he was stout and bold.

     When he shut himself up in the room, he took out a bottle of some good
wine, and helped himself to drink; it was good old wine, and he soon felt
himself warmed and comforted.  He could have faced the enemy.

     "If one bottle produces such an effect," he muttered, "what will two 
do?"

     This was a question that could only be solved by trying it, and this he
proceeded to do.

     But first he drew a brace of long barrelled pistols from his coat 
pocket,
and taking a powder-flask and bullets from his pocket also, he loaded them
very carefully.

     "There," said he, "are my bull-dogs; and rare watch-dogs they are.  
They
never bark but they bite.  Now, if anybody does come, it will be all up with
them.  Tricks upon travellers ain't a safe game when I have these; and now 
for
the other bottle."

     He drew the other bottle, and thought, if anything, it was better than
the first.  He drank it rather quick, to be sure, and then he began to feel
sleepy and tired.

     "I think I shall go to bed," he said; "that is, if I can find my way
there, for it does seem to me as if the door was travelling.  Never mind, it
will make a call here again presently, and then I'll get through."

     So saying, he arose.  Taking the candle in his hand, he walked with a
better step than might have been expected under the circumstance.  True it 
was
the candle wagged to and fro, and his shadow danced upon the wall; but 
still,
when he got to the bed, he secured his door, put the light in a safe place,
threw himself down, and was fast asleep in a few moments, or rather he fell
into a doze instantaneously.

     How long he remained in this state he knew not, but he was suddenly
awakened by a loud bang, as though something heavy had flat had fallen upon
the floor -- such, for instance, as a door, or anything of that sort.  He
jumped up, rubbed his eyes, and could even then hear the reverberations
through the house.

     "What is that?" he muttered; "what is that?"

     He listened, and thought he could hear something moving down stairs, 
and
for a moment he was seized with an ague fit; but recollecting, I suppose, 
that
there were some valuables down stairs that were worth fighting for, he
carefully extinguished the light that still burned, and softly crept down
stairs.

     When he got down stairs he thought he could hear some one scramble up 
the
kitchen stairs, and then into the room where the bureau was.  Listening for 
a
moment to ascertain if there were more than one, and then feeling convinced
there was not, he followed into the parlour, when he heard the cabinet open 
by
a key.

     This was a new miracle, and one he could not understand; and then he
heard the papers begin to rattle and rustle; so, drawing out one of the
pistols, he cocked it, and walked in.

     The figure instantly began to jump about; it was dressed in white -- in
grave-clothes.  He was terribly nervous, and shook so he feared to fire the
pistol; but at length he did, and the report was followed by a fall and a 
loud
groan.

     This was very dreadful -- very dreadful; but all was quiet, and he lit
the candle again, and approached the body to examine it and ascertain if he
knew who it was.  A groan came from it. The bureau was open, and the figure
clutched firmly a will in his hand.

     The figure was dressed in grave-clothes, and he started up when he saw
the form and features of his own uncle, the man who was dead, who somehow or
other had escaped his confinement, and found his way up, here.  He held his
will firmly; and the nephew was so horrified and stunned, that he threw down
the light, and rushed out of the room with a shout of terror, and never
returned again.

          *          *          *          *          *          *           

     The narrator concluded, and one of the guests said,--

     "And do you really believe it?" -- "No, no -- to be sure not."

     "You don't?" -- "Why should I?  My friend was, out of all hand, one of
the greatest liars I ever came near; and why, therefore, should I believe 
him?
I don't, on my conscience, believe one word of it."

     "It was now half-past twelve, and, as Tom Eccles came not back, and the
landlord did not feel disposed to draw any more liquor, they left the inn, 
and
retired to their separate houses in a great state of anxiety to know the 
fate
of their respective wagers.

Next Time: The Vampire in the Moonlight Moonlight. -- The False Friend.




                               Chapter LXIV.

THE VAMPIRE IN THE MOONLIGHT. -- THE FALSE FRIEND.


      Part of the distance being accomplished toward the old ruins, Tom 
Eccles
began to feel that what he had undertaken was not altogether such child's-
play
as he had at first imagined it to be.  Somehow or another, with a singular 
and
uncomfortable sort of distinctness, there came across his mind every story
that he had remembered of the wild and the wonderful.  All the long-since-
forgotten tales of superstition that in early childhood he had learned, came
now back upon him, suggesting to his mind a thousand uncomfortable fancies 
of
the strangest description.

     It was not likely that when once a man under such circumstances, got 
into
such a frame of mind, he would readily get out of it again, while he 
continued
surrounded by such scenes as had first called them into existence.

     No doubt, had he turned about, and faced the inn again instead of the 
old
ruins, he would soon have shaken off these "thick-coming fancies;" but such 
a
result was not to be expected, so long as he kept on toward the dismal place
he had pledged himself to reach.

     As he traversed meadow after meadow, he began to ask himself some
questions, which he found that he could not answer exactly in a consolatory
manner, under the present state of things.

     Among these questions was the very pertinent one of, -- "It's no 
argument
against vampyres, because I don't see the use of 'em -- is it?"  This he was
compelled to answer as he had put it; and when, in addition, he began to
recollect that, without the shadow of a doubt, Sir Francis Varney, the
supposed vampyre, had been chased across the fields to that very ruin, 
whither
he was bound, and had then and there disappeared, he certainly found himself
in a decidedly uncomfortable and most unpromising situation.

     "No," he said, "no.  Hang it, I won't go back now, to be made the
laughing-stock of the whole town, which I should be. Come what may of it, I
will go on as I have commenced; so I shall put on as stout a heart as I 
can."

     Then, having come to this resolve, he strove might and main to banish
from his mind those disagreeable reminiscences that had been oppressing him,
to turn his attention to subjects of a different complexion.

     During the progress of making this endeavour, which was rather futile, 
he
came within sight of the ruins.  Then he slackened his pace a little, 
telling
himself, with a pardonable self-deceit, that it was common, ordinary caution
only, which induced him to do so, and nothing at all in the shape of fear.

     "Time enough," he remarked, "to be afraid, when I see anything to be
afraid of, which I don't see as yet.  So, as all's right, I may as well put 
a
good face upon the matter."

     He tried to whistle a tune, but it turned out only a melancholy 
failure;
so he gave that up in despair, and walked on until he got within a hundred
yards, or thereabouts, of the old ruins.

     He thus proceeded, and bending his ear close to the ground, he listened
attentively for several minutes.  Somehow, he fancied that a strange,
murmuring sound came to his ears; but he was not quite sure that it 
proceeded
from the ruins, because it was just that sort of sound that might come from 
a
long way off, being mellowed by distance, although, perhaps, loud enough at
its source.

     "Well, well," he whispered to himself, "it don't matter much, after 
all. 
Go I must, and hide the handkerchiefs somewhere, or else be laughed at,
besides losing my wages.  The former I don't like, and the latter I cannot
afford."

     Thus clinching the matter by such knock-down arguments, he walked on
until he was almost within the very shadow of the ruins, and, probably, it 
was
at this juncture that his footsteps may have been heard by Marchdale and Sir
Francis Varney.

     Then he paused again; but all was profoundly still, and he began to 
think
that the strange sort of murmuring noise that he had heard must have come 
from
far off, and not at all from any person or persons within the ruins.

     "Let me see," he said to himself; "I have five handkerchiefs to hide
among the old ruins somewhere, and the sooner I do so the better, because 
then
I will get away; for, as regards staying here to watch, Heaven knows how 
long,
for Sir Francis Varney, I don't intend to do it, upon second thoughts, and
second thoughts, they say, are generally best."

     With the most careful footsteps now, as if he were treading upon some
fragile substance, which he feared to injure, he advanced until he was 
fairly
within the precincts of the ancient place, which now bore so ill a 
reputation.

     He then made to himself much the same remark that Sir Francis Varney 
had
made to Marchdale, with respect to the brightening up of the sky, in
consequence of its being near the time for the moon to rise from the 
horizon,
and he saw more clearly around him, although he could not find any good 
place
to hide the handkerchiefs in.

     "I must and will," he said, "hide them securely; for it would, indeed, 
be
remarkably unpleasant, after coming here and winning my wages, to have the
proofs that I had done so taken away by some chance visitor to the place."

     He at length saw a tolerably large stone, which stood, in a slant
position, up against one of the walls.  Its size attracted him.  He thought,
if his strength was sufficient to move it, that it would be a good thing to 
do
so, and to place the handkerchiefs beneath it, for at all events, it was so
heavy that it could not be kicked aside, and no one, without some sort of
motive to do so, beyond the mere love of labour, would set about moving it
from its position.

     "I may go further and fare worse," he said to himself; "so here shall 
all
the handkerchiefs lie, to afford a proof that I have been here."

     He packed them into a small compass, and then stooped to roll aside the
heavy stone, when, at the moment, before he could apply his strength to that
purpose, he heard some one, in his immediate neighbourhood, say, -- "Hist!"

     This was so sudden, and so utterly unexpected, that he not only ceased
his exertions to move the stone, but he nearly fell down in his surprise.

     "Hist -- hist!"

     "What -- what," gasped Tom Eccles -- "what are you?" -- "Hush -- hush -
-
hush!"

     The perspiration broke out upon his brow, and he leaned against the 
wall
for support, as he managed to say, faintly, --

     "Well, hush -- what then?" -- "Hist!"

     "Well, I hear you.  Where are you?" -- "Near at hand.  Who are you?"

     "Tom Eccles.  Who are you?" -- "A friend.  Have you seen anything?"

     "No; I wish I could.  I should like to see you if I could." -- "I'm
coming."

     There was a slow and cautious footstep, and Marchdale advanced to where
Tom Eccles was standing.

     "Come, now," said the latter, when he saw the dusky-looking form 
stalking
towards him; "till I know you better, I'll be obliged to you to keep off.  I
am well armed.  Keep your distance, be you friend or foe."

     "Armed!" exclaimed Marchdale, and he at once paused. -- "Yes, I am."

     "But I am a friend.  I have no sort of objection frankly to tell you my
errand.  I am a friend of the Bannerworth family, and have kept watch here 
now
for two nights, in the hopes of meeting with Varney, the vampyre."

     "The deuce you have; and pray what may your name be?" -- "Marchdale."

     "If you be Mr. Marchdale, I know you by sight; for I have seen you with
Mr. Henry Bannerworth several times.  Come out from among the shadows, and 
let
us have a look at you; but, till you do, don't come within arm's length of 
me.
I am not naturally suspicious; but we cannot be too careful."

     "Oh! certainly -- certainly.  The silver edge of the moon is now just
peeping up from the east, and you will be able to see me well, if you step
from the shadow of the wall by which you now are."

     This was a reasonable enough proposition, and Tom Eccles at once 
acceded
to it, by stepping out boldly into the partial moonlight, which now began to
fall upon the open meadows, tinting the grass with a silvery refulgence, and
rendering even minute objects visible.  The moment he saw Marchdale he knew
him, and, advancing frankly to him, he said, --

     "I know you, sir, well."

     "And what brings you here?" -- "A wager for one thing, and a wish to 
see
the vampyre for another."

     "Indeed!" -- "Yes, I must own I have such a wish, along with a still
stronger one, to capture him, if possible; and, as there are now two of us,
why may we not do it?"

     "As for capturing him," said Marchdale, "I should prefer shooting him." 
--
"You would?"

     "I would, indeed.  I have seen him once shot down, and he is now, I 
have
no doubt, as well as ever.  What were you doing with that huge stone I saw 
you
bending over?" -- "I have some handkerchiefs to hide here, as a proof that I
have to-night really been to this place."

     "Oh, I will show you a better spot, where there is a crevice in which 
you
can place them with perfect safety.  Will you walk with me into the ruins?" 
--
"Willingly."

     "It's odd enough," remarked Marchdale, after he had shown Tom Eccles
where to hide the handkerchiefs, "that you and I should both be here upon so
similar an errand." -- "I'm very glad of it.  It robs the place of its 
gloom,
and makes it ten times more endurable than it otherwise would be.  What do 
you
propose to do if you see the vampyre?"

     "I shall try a pistol bullet on him.  You say you are armed?" -- "Yes."

     "With pistols?" -- "One.  Here it is."

     "A huge weapon; loaded well, of course?" -- "Oh, yes, I can depend upon
it; but I did not intend to use it, unless assailed."

     "'Tis well.  What is that?" -- "What -- what?"

     "Don't you see anything there?  Come farther back.  Look -- look.  At 
the
corner of that wall there I am certain there is the flutter of a human
garment."  -- "There is -- there is."

     "Hush!  Keep close.  It must be the vampyre." -- "Give me my pistol. 
What are you doing with it?"

     "Only ramming down the charge more firmly for you.  Take it.  If that 
be
Varney the vampyre, I shall challenge him to surrender the moment he 
appears;
and if he does not, I will fire upon him, and do you do so likewise." --
"Well, I -- I don't know."

     "You have scruples?" -- "I certainly have."

     "Well, well -- don't you fire, then, but leave it to me. There; look --
look.  Now have you any doubt?  There he goes, in his cloak.  It is -- it is 
--
-- " "-- Varney, by Heavens!" cried Tom Eccles.

     "Surrender!" shouted Marchdale.

     At the instant Sir Francis Varney sprang forward, and made off at a 
rapid
pace across the meadows.

     "Fire after him -- fire!" cried Marchdale, "or he will escape.  My 
pistol
has missed fire.  He will be off."

     On the impulse of the moment, and thus urged by the voice and the 
gesture
of his companion, Tom Eccles took aim as well as he could, and fired after 
the
retreating form of Sir Francis Varney.  His conscience smote him as he heard
the report and saw the flash of the large pistol amid the half sort of
darkness that was still around.

     The effect of the shot was then to him painfully apparent. He saw 
Varney
stop instantly; then make a vain attempt to stagger forward a little, and
finally fall heavily to the earth, with all the appearance of one killed 
upon
the spot.

     "You have hit him," said Marchdale -- "you have hit him. Bravo!" -- "I
have -- hit him."

     "Yes, a capital shot, by Jove!" -- "I am very sorry."

     "Sorry! sorry for ridding the world of such a being!  What was in your
pistol?" -- "A couple of slugs."

     "Well, they have made a lodgment in him, that's quite clear.  Let's go 
up
and finish him at once." -- "He seems finished."

     "I beg your pardon there.  When the moonbeams fall upon him he'll get 
up
and walk away as if nothing was the matter." -- "Will he?" cried Tom, with
animation -- "will he?"

     "Certainly he will." -- "Thank God for that.  Now, hark you, Mr.
Marchdale:  I should not have fired if you had not at the moment urged me to
do so.  Now, I shall stay and see if the effect which you talk of will 
ensue,
and although it may convince me that he is a vampyre, and that there are 
such
things, he may go off, scot free, for me."

     "Go off?" --- "Yes; I don't want to have even a vampyre's blood upon my
hands."

     "You are exceedingly delicate." -- "Perhaps I am; it's my way, though.  
I
have shot him -- not you, mind; so, in a manner of speaking, he belongs to 
me.
Now, mark you:  I won't have him touched any more to-night, unless you think
there's a chance of making a prisoner of him without violence."

     "There he lies; you can go and make a prisoner of him at once, dead as 
he
is; and if you take him out of the moonlight --"

     "I understand; he won't recover." -- "Certainly not."

     "But, as I want him to recover, that don't suit me." -- "Well, I cannot
but honour your scruples, although I do not actually share in them; but I
promise you that, since such is your wish, I will take no steps against the
vampyre; but let us come up to him and see if he be really dead, or only 
badly
wounded."

     Tom Eccles hung back a little from this proposal; but upon being urged
again by Marchdale, and told that he need not go closer than he chose, he
consented, and the two of them approached the prostrate form of Sir Francis
Varney, which lay upon its face in the faint moonlight, which each moment 
was
gathering strength and power.

     "He lies upon his face," said Marchdale.  "Will you go and turn him
over?" -- "Who -- I?  God forbid I should touch him."

     "Well -- well, I will.  Come on."

     They halted within a couple of yards of the body.  Tom Eccles would not
go a step farther; so Marchdale advanced alone, and pretended to be, with
great repugnance, examining for the wound.

     "He is quite dead," he said; "but I cannot see the hurt." -- "I think 
he
turned his head as I fired."

     "Did he?  Let us see."

     Marchdale lifted up the head, and disclosed such a mass of clotted-
looking blood, that Tom Eccles at once took to his heels, nor stopped until 
he
was nearly as far off as the ruins. Marchdale followed him more slowly, and
when he came up to him, he said, --

     "The slugs have taken effect on his face." -- "I know it -- I know it. 
Don't tell me."

     "He looks horrible." -- "And I am a murderer."

     "Psha!  You look upon this matter too seriously.  Think of who and what
he was, and then you will soon acquit yourself of being open to any such
charge." -- "I am bewildered, Mr. Marchdale, and cannot now know whether he 
be
a vampyre or not. If he be not, I have murdered, most unjustifiably, a 
fellow-
creature."

     "Well, but if he be?" -- "Why, even then I do not know but that I ought
to consider myself as guilty.  He is one of God's creatures if he were ten
times a vampyre."

     "Well, you really do take a serious view of the affair." -- "Not more
serious than it deserves."

     "And what do you mean to do?" -- "I shall remain here to await the 
result
of what you tell me will ensue, if he be a real vampire.  Even now the
moonbeams are full upon him, and each moment increasing in intensity.  Think
you he will recover?"

     "I do indeed." -- "Then here will I wait."

     "Since that is your resolve, I will keep you company.  We shall easily
find some old stone in the ruins which will serve us for a seat, and there 
at
leisure we can keep our eyes upon the dead body, and be able to observe if 
it
make the least movement."

     This plan was adopted, and they sat down just within the ruins, but in
such a place that they had a full view of the dead body, as it appeared to 
be,
of Sir Francis Varney, upon which the sweet moonbeams shone full and clear.

     Tom Eccles related how he was incited to come upon his expedition, but 
he
might have spared himself that trouble, as Marchdale had been in a retired
corner of the inn parlour before he came to his appointment with Varney, and
heard the business for the most part proposed.

     Half-an-hour, certainly not more, might have elapsed; when suddenly Tom
Eccles uttered an exclamation, partly of surprise and partly of terror, --

     "He moves; he moves!" he cried.  "Look at the vampyre's body."

     Marchdale affected to look with an all-absorbing interest, and there 
was
Sir Francis Varney, raising slowly one arm with the hand outstretched 
towards
the moon, as if invoking that luminary to shed more of its beams upon him. 
Then the body moved slowly, like some one writhing in pain, and yet unable 
to
move from the spot on which it lay.  From the head to the foot, the whole
frame seemed to be convulsed, and now and then as the ghastly object seemed 
to
be gathering more strength, the limbs were thrown out with a rapid and a
frightful looking violence.

     It was truly to one, who might look upon it as a reality and no juggle, 
a
frightful sight to see, and although Marchdale, of course, tolerably well
preserved his equanimity, only now and then, for appearance sake, affecting 
to
be wonderfully shocked, poor Tom Eccles was in such a state of horror and
fright that he could not, if he would, have flown from the spot, so 
fascinated
was he by the horrible spectacle.

     This was a state of things which continued for many minutes, and then 
the
body showed evident symptoms of so much returning animation, that it was 
about
to rise from its gory bed and mingle once again with the living.

     "Behold!" said Marchdale -- "behold!" -- "Heaven have mercy upon us!"

     "It is as I said; the beams of the moon have revived the vampyre.  You
perceive now that there can be no doubt." -- "Yes, yes, I see him; I see 
him."

     Sir Francis Varney now, as if with a great struggle, rose to his feet,
and looked up at the bright moon for some moments with such an air and 
manner
that it would not have required any very great amount of imagination to
conceive that he was returning to it some sort of thanksgiving for the good
that it had done to him.

     He then seemed for some moments in a state of considerable indecision 
as
to which way he should proceed.  He turned around several times.  Then he
advanced a step or two towards the house, but apparently his resolution
changed again, and casting his eyes upon the ruins, he at once made towards
them.

     This was too much for the philosophy as well as for the courage of Tom
Eccles.  It was all very well to look on at some distance, and observe the
wonderful and inexplicable proceedings of the vampyre; but when he showed
symptoms of making a nearer acquaintance, it was not to be borne.

     "Why, he's coming here," said Tom. -- "He seems so indeed," remarked
Marchdale.

     "Do you mean to stay?" -- "I think I shall."

     "You do, do you?" -- "Yes, I should much like to question him, and as 
we
are two to one I think we really can have nothing to fear."

     "Do you?  I'm altogether of a different opinion.  A man who has more
lives than a cat don't much mind at what odds he fights.  You may stay if 
you
like." -- "You do not mean to say that you will desert me?"

     "I don't see a bit how you call it deserting you; if we had come out
together on this adventure, I would have stayed it out with you; but as we
came separate and independent, we may as well go back so." -- "Well, but -- 
"

     "Good morning," cried Tom, and he at once took to his heels towards the
town, without staying to pay any attention to the remonstrances of 
Marchdale,
who called after him in vain.

     Sir Francis Varney, probably, had Tom Eccles not gone off so rapidly,
would have yet taken another thought, and gone in another direction than 
that
which led him to the ruins, and Tom, if he had had his senses  fully about
him, as well as all his powers of perception, would have seen that the
progress of the vampyre was very slow, while he continued to converse with
Marchdale, and that it was only when he went off at good speed that Sir
Francis Varney likewise thought it prudent to do so.

     "Is he much terrified?" said Varney, as he came up to Marchdale. -- 
"Yes, most completely."

     "This, then, will make a good story in the town." -- "It will, indeed,
and not a little enhance your reputation."

     "Well, well; it don't much matter now; but if by terrifying people I 
can
purchase for myself anything like immunity for the past, I shall be
satisfied." -- "I think you may now safely reckon that you have done so.  
This
man who has fled with so much precipitation, had courage."

     "Unquestionably." -- "Or else he would have shrunk from coming here at
all."

     "True, but his courage and presence arose from his strong doubts as to
the existence of such beings as vampyres." -- "Yes, and now that he is
convinced, his bravery has evaporated along with his doubts; and such a tale
as he has now to tell, will be found sufficient to convert even the most
sceptical in the town."

     "I hope so." -- "And yet it cannot much avail you."

     "Not personally, but I must confess that I am not dead to all human
passions, and I feel some desire of revenge against those dastards who by
hundreds have hunted me, burnt down my house, and sought my destruction." --
"That I do not wonder at."

     "I would fain leave among them a legacy of fear.  Such fear as shall
haunt them and their children for years to come.  I would wish that the name
of Varney, the vampire, should be a sound of terror for generations." -- "It
will be so."

     "It shall." -- "And now, then for a consideration of what is to be done
with our prisoner.  What is your resolve upon that point?"

     "I have considered it while I was lying upon yon green sward waiting 
for
the friendly moonbeams to fall upon my face, and it seems to me that there 
is
no sort of resource but to -- " -- "Kill him?"

     "No, no." -- "What then?"

     "To set him free." -- "Nay, have you considered the immense hazard of
doing so?  Think again; I pray you think again.  I am decidedly of opinion
that he more than suspects who are his enemies; and in that case, you know
what consequences would ensue; besides, have we not enough already to
encounter?  Why should we add another young, bold, determined spirit to the
band which is already arrayed against us?"

     "You talk in vain, Marchdale; I know to what it all tends; you have a
strong desire for the death of this young man." -- "No; there you wrong me.  
I
have no desire for his death, for its own sake; but where great interests 
are
at stake, there must be sacrifices made."

     "So there must; therefore, I will make a sacrifice, and let this young
prisoner free from his dungeon." -- "If such be your determination, I know
well it is useless to combat with it. When do you purpose giving him his
freedom?"

     "I will not act so heedlessly as that your principles of caution shall
blame me.  I will attempt to get from him some promise that he will not make
himself an active instrument against me.  Perchance, too, as Bannerworth 
Hall,
which he is sure to visit, wears such an air of desertion, I may be able to
persuade him that the Bannerworth family, as well as his uncle, have left 
this
part of the country altogether; so that, without making any inquiry for them
about the neighbourhood, he may be induced to leave at once." -- "That would
be well."

     "Good; your prudence approves of the plan, and therefore it shall be
done." -- "I am rather inclined to think" said Marchdale, with a slight tone
of sarcasm, "that if my prudence did not approve of the plan, it would still
be done."

     "Most probably," said Varney, calmly.  -- "Will you release him 
tonight?"

     "It is morning, now, and soon the soft grey light of day will tint the
east.  I do not think I will release him till sunset again now.  Has he
provision to last him until then?" -- "He has."

     "Well, then, two hours after sunset, I will come here and release him
from his weary bondage, and now I must go to find some place in which to 
hide
my proscribed head.  As for Bannerworth Hall, I will yet have it in my 
power;
I have sworn to do so, I will keep my oath." -- "The accomplishment of our
purpose, I regret to say, seems as far off as ever."

     "Not so -- not so.  As I before remarked, we must disappear, for a 
time,
so as to lull suspicion.  There will then arise a period when Bannerworth 
Hall
will neither be watched, as it is now, nor will it be inhabited, -- a period
before the Bannerworth family has made up its mind to go back to it, and 
when
long watching without a result has become too tiresome to be continued at 
all;
then we can at once pursue our object." -- "Be it so."

     "And now, Marchdale, I want more money." -- "More money!"

     "Yes; you know that I have had large demands of late." -- "But I
certainly had an impression that you were possessed, by the death of some 
one,
with very ample means."

     "Yes, but there is a means by which all is taken from me. I have no 
real
resources but what are rapidly used up, so I must come upon you again." -- 
"I
have already completely crippled myself as regards money matters in this
enterprise, and I do certainly hope that the fruits will not be far distant. 
If they be much longer delayed, I shall really not know what to do. However,
come to the lodge where you have been staying, and then I will give you, to
the extent of my ability, whatever sum you think your present exigencies
require."

     "Come on, then, at once.  I would certainly, of course, rather leave 
this
placed now, before daybreak.   Come on, I say, come on."

     Sir Francis Varney and Marchdale walked for some time in silence across
the meadows.  It was evident that there was not between these associates the
very best of feelings.  Marchdale was always smarting under an assumption of
authority over him, on the part of Sir Francis Varney, while the latter
scarcely cared to conceal any portion of the contempt with which he regarded
his hypocritical companion.

     Some very strong band of union, indeed, must surely bind these two
strange persons together!  It must be something of a more than common nature
which induces Marchdale not only to obey the behests of his mysterious
companion, but to supply him so readily with money as we perceive he 
promises
to do.

     And as regards Varney, the vampyre, he, too, must have some great 
object
in view to induce him to run such a world of risk, and to take so much 
trouble
as he was doing with the Bannerworth family.

     What his object is, and what is the object of Marchdale, will, now that
we have progressed so far in our story, soon appear, and then much that is
perfectly inexplicable, will become clear and distinct, and we shall find 
that
some strong human motives are at the bottom of it all.

 Next Time: Varney's Visit to the Dungeon of the Lonely Prisoner in the 
Ruins.




                                Chapter LXV.

VARNEY'S VISIT TO THE DUNGEON OF THE LONELY PRISONER IN THE RUINS.


     Evident it was that Marchdale was not near so scrupulous as Sir Francis
Varney, in what he chose to do.  He would, without hesitation, have 
sacrificed
the life of that prisoner in the lonely dungeon, whom it would be an insult 
to
the understanding of our readers, not to presume that they had, long ere 
this,
established in their minds to be Charles Holland.

     His own safety seemed to be the paramount consideration with Marchdale,
and it was evident that he cared for nothing in comparison with that object.

     It says much, however, for Sir Francis Varney, that he did not give in 
to
such a blood-thirsty feeling, but rather chose to set the prisoner free, and
run all the chances of the danger to which he might expose himself by such a
course of conduct, than to insure safety, comparatively, by his destruction.

     Sir Francis Varney is evidently a character of strangely mixed 
feelings. 
It is quite evident that he has some great object in view, which he wishes 
to
accomplish almost at any risk; but it is equally evident, at the same time,
that he wishes to do so with the least possible injury to others, or else he
would never had behaved as he had done in his interview with the beautiful 
and
persecuted Flora Bannerworth, or now suggested the idea of setting Charles
Holland free from the dreary dungeon in which he had so long been confined.

     We are always anxious and willing to give every one credit for the good
that is in them; and, hence, we are pleased to find that Sir Francis Varney,
despite his singular, and apparently preternatural capabilities, has 
something
sufficiently human about his mind and feelings, to induce him to do as 
little
injury as possible to others in the pursuit of his own objects.

     Of the two, vampyre as he is, we prefer him much to the despicable and
hypocritical Marchdale, who, under the pretence of being the friend of the
Bannerworth family, would freely have inflicted upon them the most deadly
injuries.

     It was quite clear that he was most dreadfully disappointed that Sir
Francis Varney, would not permit him to take the life of Charles Holland, 
and
it was with a gloomy and dissatisfied air that he left the ruins to proceed
towards the town, after what we may almost term the altercation he had had
with Varney the vampyre upon that subject.

     It must not be supposed that Sir Francis Varney, however, was blind to
the danger which must inevitably accrue from permitting Charles Holland once
more to obtain his liberty.

     What the latter would be able to state would be more than sufficient to
convince the Bannerworths, and all interested in their fortunes, that
something was going on of a character, which, however supernatural as it 
might
seem to be, still seemed to have some human and ordinary objects for its 
ends.

     Sir Francis Varney thought over all this before he proceeded, according
to his promise, to the dungeon of the prisoner; but it would seem as if 
there
was considerable difficulty, even to an individual of his long practice in 
all
kinds of chicanery and deceit, in arriving at any satisfactory conclusion, 
as
to a means of making Charles Holland's release a matter of less danger to
himself, than it would be likely to be, if, unfettered by obligation, he was
at once set free.

     At the solemn hour of midnight, while all was still, that is, to say, 
on
the night succeeding the one, on which he had held the interview with
Marchdale, we have recorded, Sir Francis Varney alone sought the silent 
ruins.
He was attired, as usual, in his huge cloak, and, indeed, the chilly air of
the evening warranted such protection against its numerous discomforts.

     Had any one seen him, however, upon that evening, they would have
observed an air of great doubt, and irresolution upon his brow, as if he 
were
struggling with some impulses which he found it extremely difficult to
restrain.

     "I know well," he muttered, as he walked among the shadow of the ruins,
"that Marchdale's reasoning is coldly and horribly correct, when he says 
that
there is danger in setting this youth free; but, I am about to leave this
place, and not to show myself for some time, and I cannot reconcile myself 
to
inflicting upon him the horror of a death by starvation, which must ensue."

     It was a night of more than usual dullness, and, as Sir Francis Varney
removed the massy stone, which hid the narrow and tortuous entrance to the
dungeons, a chilly feeling crept over him, and he could not help supposing,
that even then Marchdale might have played him false, and neglected to 
supply
the prisoner food, according to his promise.

     Hastily he descended to the dungeons, and with a step, which had in it
far less of caution, than had usually characterised his proceedings, he
proceeded onwards until he reached that particular dungeon, in which our 
young
friend, to whom we wished so well, had been so long confined from the
beautiful and cheering light of day, and from all that his heart's best
affections most cling to.

     "Speak," said Sir Francis Varney, as he entered the dungeon.  "If the
occupant of this dread place live, let him answer one who is as much his
friend as he has been his enemy."

     "I have no friend," said Charles Holland, faintly; "unless it be one 
who
would come and restore me to liberty."

     "And how know you that I am not he?"

     "Your voice sounds like that of one of my persecutors. Why do you not
place the climax of your injuries by at once taking away my life.  I should 
be
better pleased that you would do so, than that I should wear out the useless
struggle of existence in so dreary and wretched an abode as this."

     "Young man," said Sir Francis Varney, "I have come to you on a greater
errand of mercy than, probably, you will ever give me credit for.  There is
one who would too readily have granted your present request, and who would 
at
once have taken that life of which you  profess to be so wearied; but which
may yet present to you some of its sunniest and most beautiful aspects."

     "Your tones are friendly," said Charles; "but yet I dread some new
deception.  That you are one of those who consigned me by stratagem, and by
brute force, to this place of durance, I am well assured, and, therefore, 
any
good that may be promised by you, presents itself to me in a very doubtful
character."

     "I cannot be surprised," said Sir Francis Varney, "at such sentiments
arising from your lips; but, nevertheless, I am inclined to save you.  You
have been detained here because it was supposed by being so, a particular
object would be best obtained by your absence.  That object, however, has
failed, notwithstanding, and I do not feel further inclined to protract your
sufferings.  Have you any guess as to the parties who have thus confined 
you?"
-- "I am unaccustomed to dissemble, and, therefore, I will say at once that 
I
have a guess."

     "In what way does it tend?" -- "Against Sir Francis Varney, called the
vampyre."

     "Does it strike you that this may be a dangerous candour?" -- "It may, 
or
it may not be; I cannot help it.  I know I am at the mercy of my foes, and I
do not believe that anything I can say or do will make my situation worse or
better."

     "You are much mistaken there.  In other hands than mine, it might make 
it
much worse; but it happens to be one of my weaknesses, that I am charged 
with
candour, and that I admire boldness of disposition." -- "Indeed! and yet can
behave in the manner you have done towards me."

     "Yes.  There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreampt of in
your philosophy.  I am the more encouraged to set you free, because, if I
procure from you a promise, which I intend to attempt, I am inclined to
believe that you will keep it." -- "I shall assuredly keep whatever promise 
I
may make. Propound your conditions, and if they be such as honour and 
honesty
will permit me to accede to, I will do so willingly and at once.  Heaven 
knows
I am weary enough of this miserable imprisonment."

     "Will you promise me then, if I set you free, not to mention your
suspicions that it is to Sir Francis Varney you owe this ill turn, and not 
to
attempt any act of revenge against him as a retaliation for it." -- "I 
cannot
promise so much as that. Freedom, indeed, would be a poor boon, if I were 
not
permitted freely to converse of some of the circumstances connected with my
captivity."

     "You object?" -- "I do to the former of your propositions, but not to 
the
latter.  I will promise not to go at all out of my way to execute any
vengeance upon you; but I will not promise that I will not communicate the
circumstances of my forced absence from them, to those friends whose opinion 
I
so much value, and to return to whom is almost as dear to me as liberty
itself."

     Sir Francis Varney was silent for a few moments, and then he said, in a
tone of deep solemnity, --

     "There are ninety-nine persons out of a hundred who would take your 
life
for the independence of your tongue; but I am as the hundredth one, who 
looks
with a benevolent eye at your proceedings.  Will you promise me, if I remove
the fetters which now bind your limbs, that you will make no personal attack
upon me; for I am weary of personal contention, and I will have no 
disposition
to endure it.  Will you make me this promise?" -- "I will."

     Without another word, but trusting implicitly to the promise which had
been given to him, Sir Francis Varney produced a small key from his pocket,
and unlocked with it a padlock which confined the chains about the prisoner.

     With ease, Charles Holland was then enabled to shake them off, and 
then,
for the first time, for some weeks, he rose to his feet, and felt all the
exquisite relief of being comparatively free from bondage.

     "This is delightful indeed," he said.

     "It is," said Sir Francis Varney -- "it is but a foretaste of the
happiness you will enjoy when you are entirely free.  You see that I have
trusted you."

     "You have trusted me as you might trust me, and you perceive that I 
have
kept my word."

     "You have; and since you decline to make me the promise which I would
fain have from you, to the effect that you would not mention me as one of 
the
authors of your calamity, I must trust to your honour not to attempt revenge
for what you have suffered."

     "That I will promise.  There can be but little difficulty to any 
generous
mind in giving up such a feeling.  In consequence of your sparing me what 
you
might still further have inflicted, I will let the past rest, and as if it 
had
never happened really to me; and speak of it to others, but as a 
circumstance
which I wish not to revert to, but prefer should be buried in oblivion."

     "It is well; and now I have a request to make of you, which, perhaps, 
you
will consider the hardest of all."

     "Name it.  I feel myself bound to a considerable extent to comply with
whatever you may demand of me, that is not contrary to honourable 
principle."

     "Then it is this, that, comparatively free as you are, and in a
condition, as you are, to assert your own freedom, you will not do so 
hastily,
or for a considerable period; in fact, I wish and expect that you should 
wait
yet awhile, until it shall suit me to say that it is my pleasure that you
shall be free."

     "That is, indeed, a hard condition to a man who feels, as you yourself
remark, that he can assert his freedom.  It is one which I have still a hope
you will not persevere in."

     "Nay, young man, I think that I have treated you with generosity, to 
make
you feel that I am not the worst of foes you could have had.  All I require 
of
you is, that you should wait here for about an hour.  It is now nearly one
o'clock; will you wait until you hear it strike two before you actually make
movement to leave this place?"

     Charles Holland hesitated for some moments, and then he said, --

     "Do not fancy that I am not one who appreciates the singular trust you
have reposed in me; and, however repugnant to me it may be to remain here, a
voluntary prisoner, I am inclined to do so, if it be but to convince you 
that
the trust you have reposed in me is not in vain, and that I can behave with
equal generosity to you as you can to me."

     "Be it so," said Sir Francis Varney; "I shall leave you with a full
reliance that you will keep your word; and now, farewell.  When you think of
me, fancy me rather one unfortunate than criminal, and tell yourself that 
even
Varney the vampyre had some traits in his character, which, although they
might not raise your esteem, at all events did not loudly call for your
reprobation."

     "I shall do so.  Oh! Flora, Flora, I shall look upon you once again,
after believing and thinking that I had bidden you a long and last adieu.  
My
own beautiful Flora, it is joy indeed to think that I shall look upon that
face again, which, to my perception, is full of all the majesty of
loveliness."

     Sir Francis Varney looked coldly on while Charles uttered this
enthusiastic speech.

     "Remember," he said, "till two o'clock;" and he walked towards the door
of the dungeon.  "You will have no difficulty in finding your way out of 
this
place.  Doubtless you already perceive the entrance by which I gained
admission."

     "Had I been free," said Charles, "and had the use of my limbs, I 
should,
long ere this, have worked my way to life and liberty."

     "'Tis well.  Good night."

     Varney walked from the place, and just closed the door behind him.  
With
a slow and stately step he left the ruins, and Charles Holland found himself
once more alone, but in a much more enviable condition than for many weeks 
he
could have called his.

 Next Time: Flora Bannerworth's Apparent Inconsistency. -- The Admiral's
 Circumstances and Advice. -- Mr. Chillingworth's Mysterious Absence.




                               Chapter LXVI.

FLORA BANNERWORTH'S APPARENT INCONSISTENCY. -- THE ADMIRAL'S CIRCUMSTANCES 
AND
ADVICE. -- MR. CHILLINGWORTH'S MYSTERIOUS ABSENCE.


     For a brief space let us return to Flora Bannerworth, who had suffered 
so
much on account of her affections, as well as on account of the mysterious
attack that had been made upon her by the reputed vampyre.

     After leaving Bannerworth Hall for a short time, she seemed to recover
her spirits; but this was a state of things which did not last, and only
showed how fallacious it was to expect that, after the grevious things that
had happened, she would rapidly recover her equanimity.

     It is said, by learned physiologists, that two bodily pains cannot 
endure
at the same space of time in the system; and, whether it be so or not, is a
question concerning which it would be foreign to the nature of our work, to
enter into anything like an elaborate disquisition.

     Certainly, however, so far as Flora Bannerworth was concerned, she 
seemed
inclined to show that, mentally, the observation was a true one, for that, 
now
she became released from a continued dread of the visits of the vampyre, her
mind would, with more painful interest than ever, recur to the melancholy
condition, probably, of Charles Holland, if he were alive, and to soul-
harrowing reflections concerning him, if he were dead.

     She could not, and she did not, believe, for one moment, that his
desertion of her had been of a voluntary character. She knew, or fancied she
knew, him by far too well for that; and she more than once expressed her
opinion, to the effect that she was perfectly convinced his disappearance 
was
a part and parcel of all that train of circumstances which had so recently
occurred, and produced such a world of unhappiness to her, as well as to the
whole of the Bannerworth family.

     "If he had never loved me," she said to her brother Henry, "he would 
have
been alive and well; but he has fallen a victim to the truth of a passion, 
and
to the constancy of an affection which, to my dying day, I will believe in."

     Now that Mr. Marchdale had left the place there was no one to dispute
this proposition with Flora, for all, as well as she, were fully inclined to
think well of Charles Holland.

     It was on the very morning which preceded that evening when Sir Francis
Varney called upon Charles Holland in the manner we have related, with the
gratifying news that, upon certain conditions, he might be released, that
Flora Bannerworth, when the admiral came to see them, spoke to him of 
Charles
Holland, saying, --

     "Now, sir, that I am away from Bannerworth Hall, I do not, and cannot
feel satisfied; for the thought that Charles may eventually come back, and
seek us there, still haunts me.  Fancy him, sir, doing so and seeing the 
place
completely deserted."

     "Well, there's something in that," said the admiral; "but, however, 
he's
hardly such a goose, if it were so to happen, to give up the chase -- he'd
find us out somehow."

     "You think he would, sir? or, do you not think that despair would seize
upon him, and that, fancying we had all left the spot for ever, he might
likewise do so; so that we should lose him more effectually than we have 
done
at present?"

     "No; hardly," said the admiral; "he wouldn't be such a goose as that. 
Why, when I was of his age, if I had secured the affections of a young girl
like you, I'd have gone over all the world, but I'd have found out where she
was; and what I mean to say is, if he's half such a goose as you think him, 
he
deserves to lose you."

     "Did you not tell me something, sir, of Mr. Chillingworth talking of
taking possession of the Hall for a brief space of time?"

     "Why, yes, I did; and I expect he is there now; in fact, I'm sure he's
there, for he said he would be."

     "No, he ain't," said Jack Pringle, at that moment entering the room;
"you're wrong again, as you always are, somehow or other."

     "What, you vagabond, are you here, you mutinous rascal?" -- "Ay, ay, 
sir;
go on; don't mind me.  I wonder what you'd do, sir, if you hadn't somebody
like me to go on talking about."

     "Why, you infernal rascal, I wonder what you'd do if you had not an
indulgent commander, who puts up even with real mutiny, and says nothing 
about
it.  But where have you been?  Did you go as I directed you, and take some
provisions to Bannerworth Hall?" -- "Yes, I did; but I brought them back
again; there's nobody there, and don't seem likely to be, except a dead 
body."

     "A dead body!  Whose body can that be?" -- "Tom somebody; for I'm d----
d
if he ain't a great he cat."

     "You scoundrel, how dare you alarm me in such a way?  But do you meant 
to
tell me that you did not see Dr. Chillingworth at the Hall?" -- "How could I
see him, if he wasn't there?"

     "But he was there; he said he would be there."  -- "Then he's gone 
again,
for there's nobody there that I know of in the shape of a doctor.  I went
through every part of the ship -- I mean the house -- and the deuce a soul
could I find; and as it was rather lonely and uncomfortable, I came away
again.  'Who knows,' thought I, 'but some blessed vampyre or another may 
come
across me.'"

     "This won't do," said the old admiral, buttoning up his coat to the 
chin;
"Bannerworth Hall must not be deserted in this way.  It is quite clear that
Sir Francis Varney and his associates have some particular object in view in
getting possession of the place.  Here, you Jack." -- "Ay, ay, sir."

     "Just go back again, and stay at the Hall till somebody comes to you. 
Even such a stupid hound as you will be something to scare away unwelcome
visitors.  Go back to the Hall, I say. What are you staring at?" -- "Back to
Bannerworth Hall!" said Jack.  "What! just where I've come from; all that 
way
off, and nothing to eat, and, what's worse, nothing to drink.  I'll see you
d----d first."

     The admiral caught up a table-fork, and made a rush at Jack; but Henry
Bannerworth interfered.

     "No, no," he said, "admiral, no, no -- not that.  You must recollect 
that
you yourself have given the, no doubt, faithful fellow of yours liberty to 
do
and say a great many things which don't look like good service; but I have 
no
doubt, from what I have seen of his disposition, that he would risk his life
rather than that you should come to any harm.

     "Ay, ay," said Jack; "he quite forgets when the bullets were scuttling
our nobs off Cape Ushant, when that big Frenchman had hold of him by the
_skirf_ of his neck, and began pummelling his head, and the lee scuppers 
were
running with blood, and a bit of Joe Wiggins's brains had come slap in my 
eye,
while some of Jack Marling's guts were hanging round my neck like a nosegay,
all in consequence of grape-shot -- then he didn't say as I was a swab, when 
I
came up, and bored a hole in the Frenchman's back with a pike.  Ay, it's all
very well now, when there's a peace, and no danger, to call Jack Pringle a
lubberly rascal, and mutinous.  I'm blessed if it ain't enough to make an 
old
pair of shoes faint away."

     "Why, you infernal scoundrel," said the admiral, "nothing of the sort
ever happened, and you know it. Jack, you're no seaman." -- "Werry good," 
said
Jack; "then, if I ain't no seaman, you are what shore-going people calls a
jolly fat old humbug."

     "Jack, hold your tongue," said Henry Bannerworth; "you carry these 
things
too far.  You know very well that your master esteems you, and you should 
not
presume too much upon that fact." -- "My master!" said Jack; "don't call him
my master.  I never had a master, and don't intend.  He's my admiral if you
like; but an English sailor don't like a master."

     "I tell you what it is, Jack," said the admiral; "you've got your good
qualities, I admit." -- "Ay, ay, sir -- that's enough; you may as well leave
off well while you can."

     "But I'll just tell you what you resemble more than anything else." --
"Chew me up! what may that be, sir?"

     "A French marine." -- "A what!  A French marine!  Good-bye. I wouldn't
say another word to you, if you was to pay me a dollar a piece.  Of all the
blessed insults rolled into one, this here's the worstest.  You might have
called me a marine, or you might have called me a Frenchman; but to make out
that I'm both a marine and a Frenchman, d--me, if it isn't enough to make
human nature stand on an end!  Now, I've done with you."

     "And a good job, too," said the admiral.  "I wish I'd thought of it
before.  You're worse than a third day's ague, or a hot and a cold fever in
the tropics." -- "Very good," said Jack; "I only hope Providence will have
mercy upon you, and keep an eye upon you when I'm gone, otherwise, I wonder
what will become of you?  It wasn't so when young Belinda, who you took off
the island of Antiggy, in the Ingies, jumped overboard, and I went arter her
in a heavy swell.  Howsumdever, never mind, you shook hands with me then; 
and
while a bushel of the briney was weeping out of the corner of each of your
blinkers, you says, says you, -- "

     "Hold!" cried the admiral, "hold!  I know what I said, Jack.  It's cut 
a
fathom deep in my memory.  Give us your fist, Jack, and -- and -- " -- "Hold
yourself," said Jack; "I know what you're going to say, and I won't hear you
say it -- so there's an end of it.  Lor bless you! I knows you, I ain't a
going to leave you.  Don't be afraid; I only works you up, and works you 
down
again, just to see if there's any of that old spirit in you when we was 
aboard
the Victory.  Don't you recollect, admiral?"

     "Yes -- yes; enough, Jack." -- "Why, let me see -- that was a matter of
forty years ago, nearly, when I was a youngster."

     "There -- there, Jack -- that'll do.  You bring the events of other 
years
fresh upon my memory.  Peace -- peace.  I have not forgotten; but still, to
hear what you know of them, if recited, would give the old man a pang." -- 
"A
pang," said Jack; "I suppose that's some dictionary word for a  punch in the
eye. That would be mutiny with a vengeance; so I'm off."

     "Go, go." -- "I'm a going; and just to please you, I'll go to the Hall,
so you sha'n't say that you told me to do anything that I didn't."

     Away went Jack, whistling an air, that might have been popular when he
and the admiral were young, and Henry Bannerworth could not but remark that 
an
appearance of great sadness came over the old man, when Jack was gone.

     "I fear, sir," he said, "That heedless sailor has touched upon some
episode in your existence, the wounds of which are still fresh enough to 
give
you pain." -- "It is so," said the admiral; "just look at me, now.  Do I 
look
like the hero of a romantic love story?"

     "Not exactly, I admit." -- "Well, notwithstanding that, Jack Pringle 
has
touched a chord that vibrates in my heart yet," replied the admiral.

     "Have you any objection to tell me of it?" -- "None, whatever; and
perhaps, by the time I have done, the doctor may have found his way back
again, or Jack may bring us some news of him.  So here goes for a short, but
true yarn."

 Next Time: The Admiral's Story of the Beautiful Belinda.




                                Chapter LXVII.

THE ADMIRAL'S STORY OF THE BEAUTIFUL BELINDA.

     Just at this moment Flora Bannerworth stole into the room from whence 
she
had departed a short time since; but when she saw that old Admiral Bell was
looking so exceedingly serious, and apparently about to address Henry upon
some very important subject, she would have retired, but he turned towards
her, and said, --

     "My story, my dear, I've no objection to your hearing, and, like all
women folks, a love story never comes amiss to you:  so you may as well stay
and hear it." -- "A love story," said Flora; "you tell a love story, sir?"

     "Yes, my dear, and not only tell it, but be the hero of it, likewise;
ain't you astonished?" -- "I am, indeed."

     "Well, you'll be more astonished then before I've done; so just listen. 
As Jack Pringle says, it was the matter of about somewhere forty years ago,
that I was in command of the Victory frigate, which was placed upon the West
Indian station, during a war then raging, for the protection of our ports 
and
harbours in that vicinity.  We'd not a strong force in that quarter,
therefore, I had to cut about from place to place, and do the best I could. 
After a time, though, I rather think that we frightened off the enemy; 
during
which time I chiefly anchored off the island of Antigua, and was hospitably
received at the house of a planter, of the name of Marchant, who, in fact,
made his house my home, and introduced me to all the _elite_ of the society 
of
the island.  Ah! Miss Flora, you've no idea, to look at me now, what I was
then; I held a captain's commission, and was nearly the youngest man in the
service, with such a rank.  I was as slender, ay, as a dancing master.  
These
withered and bleached locks were black as the raven's plume.  Ay, ay, but no
matter: the planter had a daughter."

     "And you loved her?" said Flora -- "Loved her," said the old man, and 
the
flush of youthful animation came to his countenance; "I loved her, do you 
say!
I adored her; I worshipped her; she was to me -- but what a d----d old fool 
I
am; we'll skip that if you please."

     "Nay, nay," said Flora; "that is what I want to hear." -- "I haven't 
the
least doubt of that, in the world; but that's just what you won't hear; none
of your nonsense, Miss Flora; the old man may be a fool, but he isn't quite 
an
idiot."

     "He's neither," said Flora; "true feelings can never disgrace any one."
-- "Perhaps not; but, however, to make a long story short, somehow or other,
one day, Belinda was sitting alone, and I rudely pounced upon her; I rather
think then I must have said something that I oughtn't to have said, for it
took her so aback; I was forced, somehow or other, to hold her up, and then 
I
-- I -- yes; I'm sure I kissed her; and so, I told her I loved her; and 
then,
what do you think she said?"

     "Why," said Flora, "that she reciprocated the passion." -- "D--n my
rags," said Jack, who at that moment came into the room, "I suppose that's 
the
name of some shell or other."

     "You here, you villain!" said the admiral; "I thought you were gone." -
-
"So I was," said Jack, "but I came back for my hat, you see."

     Away he went again, and the admiral resumed his story.

     "Well, Miss Flora," he said, "you haven't made a good guess, as she
didn't say anything at all, she only clung to me like some wild bird to its
mother's breast, and cried as if her heart would break." -- "Indeed!"

     "Yes; I didn't know the cause of her emotion, but at last I got it out 
of
her." -- "What was it?"

     "Oh, a mere trifle; she was already married to somebody else, that's 
all;
some d----d fellow, who had gone trading about the islands, a fellow she
didn't care a straw about, that was old enough to be her father."

     "And you left her?" -- "No, I didn't.  Guess again.  I was a mad-headed
youngster.  I only felt -- I didn't think.  I persuaded her to come away 
with
me.  I took her aboard my ship, and set sail with her.  A few weeks flew 
like
hours; but one day we were hailed by a vessel, and when we neared her, she
manned a boat and brought a letter on board, addressed to Belinda.  It was
from her father, written in his last moments.  It began with a curse and 
ended
with a blessing.  There was a postscript in another hand, to say the old man
died of grief.  She read it by my side on the quarter-deck.  It dropped from
her grasp, and she plunged into the sea.  Jack Pringle went after her; but I
never saw her again."

     "Gracious Heavens! what a tragedy!" -- "Yes, tolerable," said the old
man.

     He arose and took his hat and placed it on his head.  He gave the crown
of it a blow that sent it nearly over his eyes. He thrust his hands deep 
into
his breeches pockets, clenched his teeth, and muttered something inaudible 
as
he strode from the apartment.

     "Who would have thought, Henry," said Flora, "that such a a man as
Admiral Bell had been the hero of such an adventure?" -- "Ay, who indeed; 
but
it shows that we never can judge from appearances, Flora; and that those who
seem to us the most heart-whole may have experienced the wildest 
vicissitudes
of passion."

     "And we must remember, likewise, that this was forty years ago, Henry,
which makes a material difference in the state of the case as regards 
Admiral
Bell."

     "It does indeed -- more than half a lifetime; and yet how evident it 
was
that his old feelings clung to him.  I can well imagine the many hours of
bitter regret which the memory of this his lost love must have given him."

     "True -- true."  I can feel something for him; for have I not lost one
who loved me -- a worse loss, too, than that which Admiral Bell relates; for
am I not a prey to all the horrors of uncertainty?  Whereas, he knew the
worst, and that, at all events, death had claimed its victim, leaving 
nothing
to conjecture in the shape of suffering, so that the mind had nothing to do
but to recover slowly, but surely, as it would, from the shock which it had
received."

     "That is worse than you, Flora; but rather would I have you cherish 
hope
of soon beholding Charles Holland, probably alive and well, than fancy any
great disaster has come over him."

     "I will endeavour to do so," replied Flora.

     "I long to hear what has become of Dr. Chillingworth.  His 
disappearance
is most singular; for I fully suspected that he had some particular object 
in
view in getting possession for a short time of Bannerworth Hall; but now, 
from
Jack Pringle's account, he appears not to be in it, and, in fact, to have
disappeared completely from the sight of all who knew him."

     "Yes," said Flora; "but he may have done that, brother, still in
furtherance of his object."

     "It may be so, and I will hope that it is so.  Keep yourself close,
sister, and see no one, while I proceed to his house to inquire if they have
heard anything of him.  I will return soon, be assured; and, in the 
meantime,
should you see my brother, tell him I shall be at home in an hour or so, and
not to leave the cottage; for it is more than likely that the admiral has 
gone
to Bannerworth Hall, so that you may not see anything of him for some time."

 Next Time: Marchdale's Attempted Villany, And Its Result.




                               Chapter LXVIII.

MARCHDALE'S ATTEMPTED VILLANY, AND ITS RESULT.


     Varney the vampyre left the dungeon of Charles Holland amid the grey
ruins, with a perfect confidence the young man would keep his word, and not
attempt to escape from that place until the time had elapsed which he had
dictated to him.

     And well might he have that confidence, for having once given his word
that he would remain until he heard the clock strike two from a neighbouring
church, Charles Holland never dreamt for a moment of breaking it.

     To be sure it was a weary time to wait when liberty appeared before 
him;
but he was the soul of honour, and the least likely man in all the world to
infringe in the slightest upon the condition which he had, of his own free
will, acceded to.

     Sir Francis Varney walked rapidly until he came nearly to the outskirts
of the town, and then he slackened his pace, proceeding more cautiously, and
looking carefully about him, as if he feared to meet any one who might
recognize him.

     He had not proceeded far in this manner, when he became conscious of 
the
cautious figure of a man gliding along in the opposite direction that which 
he
was taking.

     A suspicion struck him, from the general appearance, that it was
Marchdale, and if so, he wondered to see him abroad at such a time.  Still 
he
would not be quite certain; but he hurried forward, so as to meet the
advancing figure, and then his suspicions were confirmed; and Marchdale with
some confusion in his looks and manners, accosted him.

     "Ah, Sir Francis Varney," he said, "you are out late." -- "Why, you 
know
I should be out late," said Varney, "and you likewise know the errand upon
which I was to be out."

     "Oh, I recollect; you were to release your prisoner." -- "Yes, I was."

     "And have you done so?" -- "Oh, no."

     "Oh, indeed.  I -- I am glad you have taken better thought of it.  Good
night -- good night; we shall meet to-morrow." -- "Adieu," said Sir Francis
Varney; and he watched the retreating figure of Marchdale, and then he 
added,
in a low tone to himself, --

     "I know his object well.  His craven spirit shrinks at the notion, a
probable enough one, I will admit, that Charles Holland has recognised him,
and that, if once free, he would denounce him to the Bannerworths, holding 
him
up to scorn in his true colours, and bringing down upon his head, perhaps,
something more than detestation and comtempt.  The villain! he is going now 
to
take the life of the man whom he considers chained to the ground.  Well, 
well,
they must fight it out together. Charles Holland is sufficiently free to 
take
his own part, although Marchdale little thinks such is the case."

     Marchdale walked on for some little distance, and then he turned and
looked after Sir Francis Varney.

     "Indeed!" he said; "so you have not released him to-night, but I know
well will do so soon.  I do not, for my part, admire this romantic 
generosity
which sets a fox free at the moment that he's the most dangerous.  It's all
very well to be generous, but it is better to be just first, and that I
consider means looking after one's self first.  I have a poniard here which
will soon put an end to the troubles of the prisoner in his dungeon -- its
edge is keen and sharp, and will readily find a way to his heart."

     He walked on quite exultingly and carelessly now, for he had got into 
the
open country, and it was extremely unlikely that he would meet anybody on 
his
road to the ruins.

     It did not take many minutes sharp walking now to bring him close to 
the
spot which he intended should become such a scene of treacherous slaughter,
and just then he heard from afar off something like the muttering of 
thunder,
as if Heaven itself was proclaiming its vengeance against the man who had 
come
out to slay one of its best and noblest creatures.

     "What is that?" said Marchdale, shrinking back a moment; "what is that 
--
an approaching storm?  It must be so, for, now I recollect me, the sun set
behind a bank of clouds of a fiery redness, and as the evening drew in there
was every appearance in the heavens of some ensuing strife of the elements."

     He listened for a few moments, and fixed his eyes intently in the
direction of the horizon from where the muttering sounds had proceeded.

     He had not long to wait before he saw a bright flash of blue lightning,
which for one instant illumined the sky; then by the time he could have
counted twelve there came the thunder which the flash preceded, and he felt
terribly anxious to complete his enterprize, so that he might get back to 
the
town and be safely housed before the storm, which was evidently approaching,
should burst upon him.

     "It is sweeping on apace," he said; "why did I not come earlier?"

     Even as he spoke he plunged among the recesses of the ruins, and
searching about for the old stone which covered the entrance to the dungeon,
he was surprised to find it rolled from its place and the aperture open.

     "What is the meaning of this?" he said; "how negligent of Sir Francis
Varney; or perhaps, after all, he was only jesting with me, and let the
prisoner go.  If that should be the case, I am foiled indeed; but surely he
could not be so full of indiscretion."

     Again came a dazzling flash of lightning, which now, surrounded by the
ruins as he was, made him shrink back and cover his eyes for a moment; and
then followed a peal of thunder with not half the duration of time between 
it
and the flash which had characterized the previous electric phenomenon.

     "The storm approaches fast," said Marchdale; "I must get my work done
quickly, if indeed my victim be here, which I begin seriously to doubt."

     He descended the intricate winding passage to the vault below, which
served the purpose of a dungeon, and when he got very nearly into the depth 
of
the recesses, he called aloud, saying, --

     "Ho! what ho! is there any one here?" -- "Yes," said Charles Holland, 
who
fancied it might be his former visitor returned. "Have you come to repent of
your purpose?"

     "Ah!" said Marchdale to himself, "Sir Francis, after all, has told me 
the
truth -- the prisoner is still here."

     The light from without was not near sufficient to send the least ray 
into
the depths of that dungeon; so that Marchdale, when he entered the place,
could see nothing but an absolute blackness.

     It was not so, however, with Charles Holland, whose eyes had been now 
so
long accustomed to the place that he could see in it as if a dim twilight
irradiated it, and he at once, in his visitor, saw his worst foe, and not 
the
man who had comparatively set him free.

     He saw, too, that the hand of his visitor grasped a weapon, which
Marchdale thought that, favoured by the darkness, he might carry openly in
perfect security.

     "Where are you?" said Marchdale; "I cannot see you." -- "Here!" said
Charles, "you may feel my grip;" and he sprung upon him in an instant.

     The attack was so sudden and so utterly unexpected, that Marchdale was
thrown backwards, and the dagger wrested from his grasp, during the first
impulse which Charles Holland had thrown into his attack.

     Moreover, his head struck with such violence against the earthen floor,
that it produced a temporary confusion of his faculties, so that, had 
Charles
Holland been so inclined, he might, with Marchdale's own weapon, have easily
taken his life.

     The young man did, on the impulse of the moment, raise it in his hand,
but, on the impulse of another thought, he cast it from him, exclaiming --

     "No, no! not that; I should be as bad as he, or nearly so. This villain
has come to murder me, but yet I will not take his life for the deed.  What
shall I do with him?  Ha! a lucky thought -- chains!"

     He dragged Marchdale to the identical spot of earth on which he had 
lain
so long; and, as Sir Francis Varney had left the key of the padlock which
bound the chains together in it, he, in a few moments, had succeeded in
placing the villain Marchdale in the same durance from which he had himself
shortly since escaped.

     "Remain there," he said, "until some one comes to rescue you.  I will 
not
let you starve to death, but I will give you a long fast; and, when I come
again, it shall be along with some of the Bannerworth family, to show them
what a viper they have fostered in their hearts."

     Marchdale was just sufficiently conscious now to feel all the realities
of his situation.  In vain he attempted to rise from his prostrate position. 
The chains did their duty, keeping down a villain with the same means that
they had held in ignominious confinment a true man.

     He was in a perfect agony, inasmuch as he considered that he would be
allowed to remain there to starve to death, thus achieving for himself a 
more
horrible death than any he had ever thought of inflicting.

     "Villain!" exclaimed Charles Holland, "you shall there remain; and, let
you have what mental sufferings you may, you richly deserve them."

     He heeded not the cries of Marchdale -- he heeded not his imprecations
any more than he did his prayers; and the arch hypocrite used both in
abundance.  Charles was but too happy once more to look upon the open sky,
although it was then in darkness, to heed anything that Marchdale, in the
agony to which he was now reduced, might feel inclined to say; and, after
glancing around him for some few moments, when he was free of the ruins, and
inhaling with exquisite delight the free air of the surrounding meadows, he
saw, by the twinkling of the lights, in which direction the town lay, and
knowing that by taking a line in that path, and then after a time diverging 
a
little to the right, he should come to Bannerworth Hall, he walked on, never
in his whole life probably feeling such an enjoyment of the mere fact of
existence as at such a moment as that of exquisite liberty.

     Our readers may with us imagine what it is to taste the free, fresh air
of heaven, after being long pent up, as he, Charles Holland, had been, in a
damp, noisome dungeon, teeming with unwholesome exhalations.  They may well
suppose with what an amount of rapture he now found himself unrestrained in
his movements by those galling fetters which had hung for so long a period
upon his youthful limbs, and which, not unfrequently in the despair of his
heart, he had thought he should surely die in.

     And last, although not least in his dear esteem, did the rapturous
thought of once more looking in the sweet face of her he loved come cross 
him
with a gust of delight.

     "Yes!" he exclaimed, as he quickened his pace; "yes! I shall be able to
tell Flora Bannerworth how well and how truly I love her.  I shall be able 
to
tell her that, in my weary and hideous imprisonment, the thought alone of 
her
has supported me."

     As he neared the Hall, he quickened his pace to such an extent that 
soon
he was forced to pause altogether, as the exertion he had undertaken pretty
plainly told him that the emprisonment, scanty diet, and want of exercise,
which had been his portion for some time past, had most materially decreased
his strength.

     His limbs trembled, and a profuse persperation bedewed his brow, 
although
the night was rather cold otherwise.

     "I am very weak," he said; "and much I wonder now that I succeeded in
overcoming that villain Marchdale; who, if I had not done so, would most
assuredly have murdered me."

     And it was a wonder; for Marchdale was not an old man, although he 
might
be considered certainly as past the prime of life, and he was of a strong 
and
athletic build.  But it was the suddenness of this attack upon him which had
given Charles Holland the great advantage, and had caused the defeat of the
ruffian who came bent on one of the most cowardly and dastardly murders that
could be committted -- namely, upon an unoffending man, whom he supposed to 
be
loaded with chains, and incapable of making the least efficient resistance.

     Charles soon again recovered sufficient breath and strength to proceed
towards the Hall, and now warned, by the exhaustion which had come over him
that he had not really anything like strength enough to allow him to proceed
rapidly, he walked with slow and deliberate steps.

     This mode of proceeding was more favourable to reflection than the 
wild,
rapid one which he had at first adopted, and in all the glowing colours of
youthful and ingenious fancy did he depict to himself the surprise and the
pleasure that would beam in the countenance of his beloved Flora when she
should find him once again by her side.

     Of course, he, Charles, could know nothing of the contrivances which 
had
been resorted to, and which the reader may lay wholly to the charge of
Marchdale, to blacken his character, and to make him appear faithless to the
love he had professed.

     Had he known this, it is probable that indignation would have added
wings to his progress, and he would not have been able to proceed at the
leisurely pace he felt that his state of physical weakness dictated to him.

     And now he saw the topmost portion of Bannerworth Hall pushing out from
amongst the trees with which the ancient pile was so much surrounded, and 
the
sight of the home of his beloved revived him, and quickened the circulation 
of
the warm blood in the veins.

     "I shall behold her now," he said -- "I shall behold her now!  A few
minutes more, and I shall hold her to my heart -- that heart which has been
ever hers, and which carried her image enshrined in its deepest recesses, 
even
into the gloom of a dungeon!"

     But let us, while Charles Holland is indulging in these delightful
anticipations -- anticipations which, we regret, in consequence of the
departure of the Bannerworths from the Hall, will not be realized so soon as
he supposes -- look back upon the discomfited hypocrite and villain,
Marchdale, who occupies his place in the dungeon of the old ruins.

     Until Charles Holland actually had left the strange, horrible, and 
cell-
like place, he could scarcely make up his mind that the young man 
entertained
a serious intention of leaving him there.

     Perhaps he did not think any one could be so cruel and so wicked as he
himself; for the reader will no doubt recollect that his, Marchdale's, 
counsel
to Varney, was to leave Charles Holland to his fate, chained down as he was 
in
the dungeon, and that fate would have been the horrible one of being starved
to death in the course of a few days.

     When now, however, he felt confident that he was deserted -- when he
heard the sound of Charles Holland's retreating footsteps slowly dying away 
in
the distance, until not the faintest echo of them reached his ears, he
despaired indeed; and the horror he experienced during the succeeding ten
minutes, might be considered an ample atonement for some of his crimes. His
brain was in a complete whirl; nothing of a tangible nature, but that he was
there, chained down, and left to starve to death, came across his intellect. 
Then a kind of madness, for a moment or two, took possession of him; he made 
a
tremendous effort to burst asunder the bands that held him.

     But it was in vain.  The chains -- which had been placed upon Charles
Holland during the first few days of his confinement, when he had a little
recovered from the effects of the violence which had been committed upon him
at the time when he was captured -- effectually resisted Marchdale.

     They even cut into his flesh, inflicting upon him some grevious wounds;
but that was all he achieved by his great effort to free himself, so that,
after a few moments, bleeding and in great pain, he, with a deep groan,
desisted from the fruitless efforts he had better not to have commenced.

     Then he remained silent for a time, but it was not the silence of
reflection; it was that of exhaustion, and, as such, was not likely to last
long; nor did it, for, in the course of another five minutes, he called out
loudly.

     Perhaps he thought there might be a remote chance that some one
traversing the meadows would hear him; and yet, if he had duly considered 
the
matter, which he was not in a fitting frame of mind to do, he would have
recollected that, in choosing a dungeon among the underground vaults of 
these
ruins, he had, by experiment, made certain that no cry, however loud, from
where he lay, could reach the upper air.  And thus had this villain, by the
very cautions which he had himself taken to ensure the safe custody of
another, been his own greatest enemy.

     "Help! help! help!" he cried frantically.  "Varney! Charles Holland! 
have
mercy upon me, and do not leave me here to starve!  Help, oh, Heaven!  
Curses
on all your heads -- curses! Oh, mercy -- mercy -- mercy!"

     In suchlike incoherent expressions did he pass some hours, until, what
with exhaustion and a raging thirst that came over him, he could not utter
another word, but lay the very picture of despair and discomfited malice and
wickedness.

 Next Time: Flora Bannerworth and Her Mother. -- The Episode of Chivalry.




                               Chapter LXIX.

FLORA BANNERWORTH AND HER MOTHER. -- THE EPISODE OF CHIVALRY.


     Gladly we turn from such a man as Marchdale to a consideration of the
beautiful and accomplished Flora Bannerworth, to whom we may, without
destroying in any way the interest of our plot, predict a much happier 
destiny
than, probably, at that time, she considers as at all likely to be hers.

     She certainly enjoyed, upon her first removal from Bannerworth Hall,
greater serenity of mind than she had done there; but, as we have already
remarked of her, the more her mind was withdrawn, by change of scene, from 
the
horrible considerations which the attack of the vampyre had forced upon her,
the more she reverted to the fate of Charles Holland, which was still 
shrouded
in so much gloom.

     She would sit and converse with her mother upon that subject until she
worked up her feelings to a most uncomfortable pitch of excitement, and then
Mrs. Bannerworth would get her younger brother to join them, who would
occasionally read to her some compositions of his own, or of some favourite
writer whom he thought would amuse her.

     It was on the very evening when Sir Francis Varney had made up his mind
to release Charles Holland, that young Bannerworth read to his sister and 
his
mother the following little chivalric incident, which he told them he 
himself
had collated from authentic sources: --

     "The knight with the green shield," exclaimed one of a party of men-at-
arms, who were drinking together at an ancient hostel, not far from 
Shrewsbury
-- "the knight with the green shield is as good a knight as ever buckled on 
a
sword, or wore spurs." -- "Then how comes it that he is not one of the 
victors
in the day's tournament?" exclaimed another. -- "By the bones of Alfred!" 
said
a third, "a man must be judged of by his deserts, and not by the partiality 
of
his friends.  That's my opinion, friends." -- "And mine too," said another.

     "That is all very true, and my opinion would go with yours, too; but 
not
in this instance.  Though you may accuse me of partiality, yet I am not so;
for I have seen some of the victors of to-day by no means forward in the 
press
of battle -- men who, I will not say feared danger, but who liked it not so
well but they avoided it as much as possible."

     "Ay, marry, and so have I.  The reason is, 'tis much easier to face a
blunted lance, than one with a spear-head; and a man may practise the one 
and
thrive in it, but not the other; for the best lance in the tournament is not
always the best arm in the battle."

     "And that is the reason of my saying the knight with the green shield 
was
a good knight.  I have seen him in the midst of the melee, when men and 
horses
have been hurled to the ground by the shock; there he has behaved himself 
like
a brave knight, and has more than once been noticed for it."

     "But how came he to be so easily over thrown to-day?  That speaks
something." -- "His horse is an old one."

     "So much the better," said another; "he's used to his work, and as
cunning as an old man." -- "But he has been wounded more than once, and is
weakened very much; besides, I saw him lose his footing, else he had
overthrown his opponent."

     "He did not seem distressed about his accident at all events, but sat
contented in the tent." -- "He knows well that those who know him will never
attribute his misadventure either to want of courage or conduct; moreover, 
he
seems to be one of those who care but little for the opinion of men who care
nothing for him."

     "And he's right.  Well, dear comrades, the health of Green Knight, or 
the
Knight with a Green Shield, for that's his name or the designation he 
chooses
to go by." -- "A health to the Knight with the Green Shield!" shouted the 
men-
at-arms, as they lifted their cups on high.

     "Who is he?" inquired one of the men-at-arms, of him who had spoken
favourably of the stranger. -- "I don't know."

     "And yet you spoke favourably of him but a few seconds back, and said
what a brave knight he was!" -- "And so I uphold him to be; but, I tell you
what, friend, I would do as much for the greatest stranger I ever met.  I 
have
seen him fight where men and horses have bit the dust in hundreds; and that,
in my opinion, speaks out for the man and warrior; he who cannot, then, 
fight
like a soldier, have better tilt at home in the castle-yard, and there win
ladies' smiles, but not the commendation of the leader of the battle."

     "That's true; I myself recollect very well Sir Hugh de Colbert, a very
accomplished knight in the castle-yard; but his men were as fine a set of
fellows as ever crossed a horse, to look at, but they proved deficient at 
the
moment of trial; they were broken, and fled in a moment, and scarce one of
them received a scratch."

     "Then they hadn't stood the shock of the foeman?" -- "No; that's
certain."

     "But still I should like to know the knight, -- to know his name very
well." -- "I know it not; he has some reason for keeping it secret, I 
suppose;
but his deeds will not shame it, be it what it may.  I can bear witness to
more than one foeman falling beneath his battle-axe."

     "Indeed!" -- "Yes; and he took a banner from the enemy in the last 
battle
that was fought."

     "Ah, well! he deserves a better fortune to-morrow.  Who is to be the
bridegroom of the beautiful Bertha, daughter of Lord de Cauci?" -- "That 
will
have to be decided:  but it is presumed that Sir Guthrie de Beaumont is the
intended."

     "Ah! but should he not prove the victor?" -- "It's understood; because
it's known he is intended by the parents of the lady, and none would be
ungallant enough to prevail against him, -- save on such conditions as would
not endanger the fruits of the victory."

     "No?" -- "Certainly not; they would lay the trophies at the foot of the
beauty worshipped by the knights at the tournament."

     "So, triumphant or not, he's to be the bridegroom; bearing off the 
prize
of valour whether or no, -- in fact deserve her or not, -- that's the fact." 
--
"So it is; so it is."

     "And a shame, too, friends; but so it is now; but yet, if the knight's
horse recovers from the strain, and is fit for work to-morrow, it strikes me
that the Green Shield will give some work to the holiday knight."

                              *    *    *    *

     There had been a grand tournament held near Shrewsbury Castle, in 
honour
of the intended nuptials of the beautiful Lady Bertha de Cauci.  She was the
only daughter of the Earl de Cauci, a nobleman of some note; he was one of 
an
ancient and unblemished name, and of great riches.

     The lady was beautiful, but, at the same time, she was an unwilling
bride, -- every one could see that; but the bridegroom cared not for that. 
There was a settled sorrow on her brow, -- a sorrow that seemed sincere and
lasting; but she spoke not of it to any one, -- her lips were seldom parted. 
She loved another.  Yes; she loved one who was far away, fighting in the 
wars
of his country, -- one who was not so rich in lands as her present 
bridegroom.

     When he left her, she remembered his promise; it was, to fight on till 
he
earned a fortune, or name that should give him some right to claim her hand,
even from her imperious father. But alas! he came not; and what could she do
against the commands of one who would be obeyed?  Her mother, too, was a
proud, haughty woman, one whose sole anxiety was to increase the grandeur 
and
power of her house by such connections.

     Thus it was pressed on by circumstances, she could no longer hold out,
more especially as she heard nothing of her knight.  She knew not where he
was, or indeed if he were living or dead.  She knew not he was never named. 
This last circumstance, indeed, gave her pain; for it assured her that he 
whom
she loved had been unable to signalize himself from among other men.  That, 
in
fact, he was unknown in the annals of fame, as well as the probability that 
he
had been slain in some of the earlier skirmishes of the war.  This, if it 
had
happened, caused her some pain to think upon; but such events were looked 
upon
with almost indifference by females, save in such cases where their 
affections
were engaged, as on this occasion. But the event was softened by the fact 
that
men were continually falling by the hand of man in such encounters, but at 
the
same time it was considered an honourable and praiseworthy death for a
soldier.  He was wounded, but not with the anguish we now hear of; for the
friends were consoled by the reflection that the deceased warrior died 
covered
with glory.

     Bertha, however, was young, and as yet she knew not the cause of her
absent knight's silence, or why he had not been heard of among the most
forward in the battle.

     "Heaven's will be done," she exclaimed; "what can I do?  I must submit 
to
my father's behests; but my future life will be one of misery and sorrow."

     She wept to think of the past, and to dream of the future; both alike
were sorrowful to think upon -- no comfort in the past and no joy in the
future.

     Thus she wept and sorrowed on the night of the first tournament; there
was to be a second, and that was to be the grand one, where her intended
bridegroom was to show himself off in her eyes, and take his part in the
sport.

                              *    *    *    *

     Bertha sat late -- she sat sorrowing by the light of the lamps and the
flickering flame of the fire, as it rose and fell on the hearth and threw
dancing shadows on the walls.

     "Oh, why, Arthur Home, should you thus be absent?  Absent, too, at such 
a
time when you are more needed than ever.  Alas, alas! you may no longer be 
in
the land of the living.  Your family is great and your name known -- your 
own
has been spoken with commendation from the lips of your friend; what more of
fame do you need? but I am speaking without purpose.  Heaven have mercy on
me."

     As she spoke she looked up and saw one of her women in waiting standing
by.

     "Well, what would you?" -- "My lady, there is one who would speak with
you," said the hand-maiden.

     "With me?" -- "Yes, my lady; be named you the Lady Bertha de Cauci."

     "Who and what is he?" she inquired, with something like trepidation, of
the maiden.  -- "I know not, my lady."

     "But gave he not some token by which I might known who I admit to my
chamber?" -- "None," replied the maiden.

     "And what does he bear by way of distinguishing himself? What crest or
device doth he bear?" -- "Merely a green shield."

     "The unsuccessful knight in the tournament to-day. Heaven's! what can 
he
desire with me; he is not -- no, no, it cannot be."  -- "Will you admit him,
lady?"

     "Indeed, I known not what to do; but yet he may have some intelligence 
to
give me.  Yes, yes, admit him; but first throw some logs on the fire."

     The attendant did as she was desired, and then quitted the room for the
purpose of admitting the stranger knight with the green shield.  In a few
moments she could hear the stride of the knight as he neared the apartment,
and she thought the step was familiar to her ear -- she thought it was the
step of Sir Arthur Home, her lover.  She waited anxiously to see the door
open, and then the stranger entered.  His form and bearing was that of her
lover, but his visor was down, and she was unable to distinguish the 
features
of the stranger.

     His armour was such as had seen many a day's hard wear, and there were
plenty of marks of the battle about him.  His travel- worn accoutrements 
were
altogether such as bespoke service in the field.

     "Sir, you desired to see me; say wherefore you do so, and if it is news
you bring."  The knight answered not, but pointed to the female attendant, 
as
if he desired she would withdraw. "You may retire," said Bertha; "be within
call, and let me know if I am threatened with interruption."

     The attendant retired, and then the knight and lady were left alone.  
The
former seemed at a loss how to break silence for some moments, and then he
said, --

     "Lady --" -- "Oh, Heavens! 'tis he!" exclaimed Bertha, as she sprang to
her feet; "it is Sir Arthur Home!"

     "It is," exclaimed the knight, pulling up his visor, and dropping on 
one
knee he encircled his arm round the waist of the lady, and at the same 
moment
he pressed her lips to his own.

     The first emotion of joy and surprise over, Bertha checked her
transports, and chid the knight for his boldness.

     "Nay, chide me not, dear Bertha; I am what I was when I left you, and
hope to find you the same."

     "Am I not?" said Bertha. -- "Truly I know not, for you seem more
beautiful than you were then; I hope that is the only change."

     "If there be a change, it is only such as you see.  Sorrow and regret
form the principal causes." -- "I understand you."

     "My intended nuptials -- " -- "Yes, I have heard all.  I came here but
late in the morning; and my horse was jaded and tired, and my impatience to
attend the tournament caused me a disaster which it is well it came not on 
the
second day."

     "It is, dear Arthur.  How is it I never heard your name mentioned, or
that I received no news from any one about you during the wars that have
ended?" -- "I had more than one personal enemy, Bertha; men who would have
been glad to see me fall, and who, in default of that, would not have minded
bribing an assassin to secure my death for them at any risk whatever."

     "Heavens! and how did you escape such a death from such people, 
Arthur?"
-- "By adopting such a device as that I wear. The Knight of the Green Shield
I'm called."

     "I saw you to-day in the tournament."  -- "And there my tired and jaded
horse gave way; but to-morrow I shall have, I hope, a different fortune."

     "I hope so too." -- "I will try; my arm has been good in battle, and I
see not why it should be deficient in peaceful jousts."

     "Certainly not.  What fortune have you met with since you left 
England?"
-- "I was of course known but to a few; among those few were the general 
under
whom I served and my more immediate officers, who I knew would not divulge 
my
secret."

     "And they did not?" -- "No; kept it nobly, and kept their eyes upon me 
in
battle; and I have reaped a rich harvest in fame, honour, and riches, I 
assure
you."

     "Thank Heaven!" said Bertha. -- "Bertha, if I be conqueror, may I claim
you in the court-yard before all the spectators?"

     "You may," said Bertha, and she hung her head. -- "Moreover," said Sir
Arthur, "you will not make a half promise, but when I demand you, you will 
at
once come down to me and accept me as your husband; if I be the victor then 
he
cannot object to the match."

     "But he will have many friends, and his intended bridegroom will have
many more, so that you may run some danger among so many enemies." -- "Never
fear for me, Bertha, because I shall have many friends of distinction there
too -- many old friends who are tried men in battle, and whose deeds are a
glory and honour to them; besides, I shall have my commander and several
gentlemen who would at once interfere in case any unfair advantage was
attempted to be taken of my supposed weakness."

     "Have you a fresh horse?" inquired Bertha. -- "I have, or shall have by
the morning; but promise me you will do what I ask you, and then my arm will
be nerved to its utmost, and I am sure to be victorious."

     "I do promise," said Bertha; "I hope you may be as successful as you 
hope
to be, Arthur; but suppose fortune should declare against you; suppose an
accident of any kind were to happen, what could be done then?" -- "I must be
content to hide myself for ever afterwards, as a defeated knight; how can I
appear before your friends as the claimant of your hand?"

     "I will never have any other." -- "But you will be forced to accept 
this
Guthrie de Beaumont, your father's chosen son-in- law."

     "I will seek refuge in a cloister." -- "Will you fly with me, Bertha, 
to
some sequestered spot, where we can live in each others society?"

     "Yes," said Bertha, "anything, save marriage with Guthrie de Beaumont."
-- "Then await the tournament of to-morrow," said Sir Arthur, "and then this
may be avoided; in the meantime, keep up a good heart and remember I am at
hand."
        
                              *    *    *    *

     These two lovers parted for the present, after a protracted interview,
Bertha to her chamber, and the Knight of the Green Shield to his tent.

     The following morning was one of great preparation; the lists had been
enlarged, and the seats made more commodious, for the influx of visitors
appeared to be much greater than had been anticipated.

     Moreover, there were many old warriors of distinction to be present,
which made the bridegroom look pale and feel uncomfortable as to the results
of the tournament.  The tilting was to begin at an early hour, and then the
feasting and the revelry would begin early in the evening, after the tilting
had all passed off.

     In that day's work there were many thrown from their saddles, and many
broke their lances.  The bridegroom tilted with several knights, and came 
off
victorious, or without disadvantage to either.

     The green knight, on the contrary, tilted with but few, and always
victorious, and such matches were with men who had been men of some name in
the wars, or at least in the tilt yard.

     The sports drew to a close, and when the bridegroom became the
challenger, the Knight of the Green Shield at once rode out quietly to meet
him.  The encounter could not well be avoided, and the bridegroom would
willingly have declined the joust with a knight who had disposed of his
enemies so easily, and so unceremoniously as he had.

     The first encounter was enough; the bridegroom was thrown to a great
distance, and lay insensible on the ground, and was carried out of the 
field. 
There was an immediate sensation among the friends of the bridegroom, 
several
of whom rode out to challenge the stranger knight for his presumption.

     In this, however, they had misreckoned the chances, for the challenged
accepted their challenges with alacrity and disposed of them one by one with
credit to himself until the day was concluded.  The stranger was then asked 
to
declare who he was, upon which he lifted his visor and said,

     "I am Sir Arthur Home, and claim the Lady Bertha as my bride, by the 
laws
of arms, and by those of love."

                              *    *    *    *

     Again the tent was felled, and again the hostelry was tenanted by the
soldier, who declared for one side and then for the other, as the cups 
clanged
and gingled together.

     "Said I not," exclaimed one of the troopers, "that the knight with a
green shield was a good knight?" -- "You did," replied the other.

     "And you knew who he was?" said another of the troopers. -- "Not I,
comrades; I had seen him fight in battle, and, therefore, partly guessed how
it would be if he had any chance with the bridegroom.  I'm glad he has won 
the
lady."

     It was true, the Lady Bertha was won, and Sir Arthur Home claimed his
bride, and then they attempted to defeat his claim; yet Bertha at once
expressed herself in his favour, so strongly that they were, however
reluctantly compelled, to consent at last.

     At this moment, a loud shout as from a multitude of persons came upon
their ears and Flora started from her seat in alarm. The cause of the alarm 
we
shall proceed to detail.

 Next Time: The Funeral of the Stranger of the Inn. -- The Popular 
Commotion,
 and Mrs. Chillingworth's Appeal to the Mob. -- The New Riot. -- The Hall in
 Danger.




                                 Chapter LXX.

THE FUNERAL OF THE STRANGER OF THE INN. -- THE POPULAR COMMOTION, AND MRS.
CHILLINGWORTH'S APPEAL TO THE MOB. -- THE NEW RIOT. -- THE HALL IN DANGER.

     A yet the town was quiet; and, though there was no appearance of riot 
or
disturbance, yet the magistracy had taken every precaution they deemed
needful, or their position and necessities warranted, to secure the peace of
the town from the like disturbance to that which had been, of late, a 
disgrace
and terror of peaceably-disposed persons.

     The populace were well advertised of the fact, that the body of the
stranger was to be buried that morning in their churchyard; and that, to
protect the body, should there be any necessity for so doing, a large body 
of
constables would be employed.

     There was no disposition to riot; at least, none was visible.  It 
looked
as if there was some event about to take place that was highly interesting 
to
all parties, who were peaceably assembling to witness the interment of 
nobody
knew who.

     The early hour at which persons were assembling, at different points,
clearly indicated that there was a spirit of curiosity about the town, so
uncommon that none would have noticed it but for the fact of the crowd of
people who hung about the streets, and there remained, listless and 
impatient.

     The inn, too, was crowded with visitors, and there were many who, not
being blessed with the strength of purse that some were, were hanging about 
in
the distance, waiting and watching the moitions of those who were better
provided.

     "Ah!" said one of the visitors, "this is a disagreeable job in your
house, landlord." -- "Yes, sir; I'd sooner it had happened elsewhere, I 
assure
you.  I know it has done me no good."

     "No; no man could expect any, and yet it is none the less unfortunate 
for
that." -- "I would sooner anything else happen than that, whatever it might
be.  I think it must be something very bad, at all events; but I dare say I
shall never see the like again."

     "So much the better for the town," said another; "for, what with 
vampyres
and riots, there has been but little else stirring than mischief and
disturbances of one kind or another."

     "Yes; and, what between Varneys and Bannerworths, we have had but 
little
peace here."

     "Precisely.  Do you know it's my opinion that the least thing would 
upset
the whole town.  Any one unlucky word would do it, I am sure," said a tall
thin man.

     "I have no doubt of it," said another; "but I hope the military would 
do
their duty under such circumstances, for people's lives and property are not
safe in such a state of things." -- "Oh, dear no."

     "I wonder what has become of Varney, or where he can have gone to." --
"Some thought he must have been burned when they burned his house," replied
the landlord.

     "But I believe it generally understood he's escaped, has he not?  No
traces of his body were found in the ruins." -- "None.  Oh! he's escaped,
there can be no doubt of that.  I wish I had some fortune depending upon the
fact; it would be mine, I am sure."

     "Well, the lord keep us from vampyres and such-like cattle," said an 
old
woman.  "I shall never sleep again in my bed with any safety.  It frightens
one out of one's life to think of it.  What a shame the men didn't cath him
and stake him!"

     The old woman left the inn as soon as she had spoke this Christian
speech.

     "Humane!" said a gentleman, with a sporting coat on.  "The old woman is
no advocate for half measures!"

     "You are right, sir," said the landlord; "and a very good look-out she
keeps upon the pot, to see it's full, and carefully blows the froth off!" --
"Ah! I thought as much."

     "How soon will the funeral take place, landlord?" inquired a person, 
who
had at that moment entered the inn. -- "In about an hour's time, sir."

     "Oh! the town seems pretty full, though it is very quiet.  I suppose it
is more as a matter of curiosity people congregate to see the funeral of 
this
stranger?"

     "I hope so, sir."

     "The time is wearing on, and if they don't make a dust, why then the
military will not be troubled."

     "I do not expect anything more, sir," said the landlord; "for you see
they must have had their swing out, as the saying is, and be fully 
satisfied. 
They cannot have much more to do in the way of exhibiting their anger or
dislike to vampyres-- they all have done enough."

     "So they have-- so they have."

     "Granted," said an old man with a troublesome cough; "but when did you
ever know a mob to be satisfied?  If they wanted the moon and got it, they'd
find out it would be necessary to have the stars also."

     "That's uncommonly true," said the landlord.  "I shouldn't be surprised
if they didn't do something worse than ever." -- "Nothing more likely," said
the little old man.  "I can believe anything of a mob-- anything-- no matter
what."

     The inn was crowded with visitors, and several extra hands were 
employed
to wait upon the customers, and a scene of bustle and activity was displayed
that was never before seen.  It would glad the heart of a landlord, though 
he
were made of stone, and landlords are usually of much more malleable 
materials
than that.

     However, the landlord had hardly time to congratulate himself, for the
bearers were come now, and the undertaker and his troop of death-following
officials.

     There was a stir among the people, who began now to awaken from the
lethargy that seemed to have come over them while they were waiting for the
moment when it should arrive, that was to place the body under the green 
sod,
against which so much of their anger had been raised.  There was a decent
silence that pervaded the mob of individuals who had assembled.

     Death, with all its ghastly insignia, had an effect even upon the
unthinking multitude, who were ever ready to inflict death or any violent
injury upon any object that came in their way-- they never hesitated; but
even these, now the object of their hatred was no more, felt appalled.

     'Tis strange what a change comes over masses of men as they gaze upon a
dead body.  It may be that they all know that to that complexion they must
come at last.  This may be the secret of the respect offered to the dead.

     The undertakers are men, however, who are used to the presence of 
death--
it is their element; they gain a living by attending upon the last obsequies
of the dead; they are used to dead bodies, and care not for them.  Some of
them are humane men, that is, in their way; and even among them are men who
wouldn't be deprived of their joke as they screwed down the last screw.  
They
could not forbear, even on this occasion, to hold their converse when left
alone.

     "Jacobs," said one who was turning a long screw, "Jacobs, my boy, do 
you
take the chair to-night?" -- "Yes," said Jacobs, who was a long lugubrious-
looking man, "I do take the chair, if I live over this blessed event."

     "You are not croaking, Jacobs, are you?  Well you are a lively 
customer,
you are." -- "Lively-- do you expect people to be lively when they are full
dressed for a funeral?  You are a nice article for your profession.  You 
don't
feel like an undertaker, you don't."

     "Don't, Jacobs, my boy.  As long as I look like one when occasion
demands; when I have done my job I puts my comfort in my pocket, and thinks
how much more pleasanter it is to be going to other people's funerals than 
to
our own, and then only see the difference as regards the money."

     "True," said Jacobs with a groan; "but death's a melancholy article, at
all events." -- "So it is."

     "And then when you come to consider the number of people we have 
buried--
how many have gone to their last homes-- and how many more will go the same
way." -- "Yes, yes; that's all very well, Jacob.  You are precious surly 
this
morning.  I'll come to-night.  You're brewing a sentimental tale as sure as
eggs is eggs."

     "Well, that is pretty certain; but as I was saying how many more are
there---"

     "Ah, don't bother yourself with calculations that have neither 
beginning
nor end, and which haven't one point to go.  Come, Jacob, have you finished
yet?" -- "Quite," said Jacob.

     They now arranged the pall, and placed all in readiness, and returned 
to
a place down stairs where they could enjoy themselves for an odd half hour,
and pass that time away until the moment should arrive when his reverence
would be ready to bury the deceased, upon consideration of the fees to paid
upon the occasion.

     The tap-room was crowded, and there was no room for the men, and they
were taken into the kitchen, where they were seated, and earnestly at work,
preparing bodily for the ceremony that had so shortly to be performed.

     "Any better, Jacobs?" -- "What do you mean?" inquired Jacobs, with a
groan.  "It's news to me if I have been ill."

     "Oh, yes, you were doleful up stairs, you know." -- "I've a proper 
regard
for my profession-- that's the difference between you and I, you know."

     "I'll wager you what you like, now, that I'll handle a corpse and drive 
a
screw in a coffin as well as you, now, although you are so solid and
miserable." -- "So you may-- so you may."

     "Then what do you mean by saying I haven't a proper regard for my
profession?" -- "I say you haven't, and there's the thing that shall prove
it-- you don't look it, and that's the truth."

     "I don't look like an undertaker! indeed I dare say I don't if I ain't
dressed like one." -- "Nor when you are," reiterated Jacob.

     "Why not, pray?" -- "Because you have always a grin on your face as 
broad
as a gridiron-- that's why."

     This ended the dispute, for the employer of the men suddenly put his 
head
in, saying,--

     "Come, now, time's up; you are wanted up stairs, all of you.  Be quick;
we shall have his reverence waiting for us, and then we shall lose his
recommendation."

     "Ready, sir," said the round man, taking up his pint and finishing it 
off
as a draught, at the same moment he thrust the remains of some bread and
cheese into his pocket.

     Jacob, too, took his pot, and, having finished it, with great gravity
followed the example of his more jocose companion, and they all left the
kitchen for the room above, where the corpse was lying ready for interment.

     There was an unusual bustle; everybody was on the tip-top of 
expectation,
and awaiting the result in a quiet hurry, and hoped to have the first 
glimpse
of the coffin, though why they should do so it was difficult to define.  But
in this fit of mysterious hope and expectation they certainly stood.

     "Will they be long?" inquired a man at the door of one inside, -- "will
they be long before they come?" -- "They are coming now," said the man.  "Do
you all keep quiet; they are knocking their heads against the top of the
landing.  Hark!  There, I told you so."

     The man departed, hearing something, and being satisfied that he had 
got
some information.

     "Now, then," said the landlord, "move out of the way, and allow the
corpse to pass out.  Let me have no indecent conduct; let everything be as 
it
should be."

     The people soon removed from the passage and vicinity of the doorway, 
and
then the mournful procession-- as the newspapers have it-- moved forward. 
They were heard coming down stairs, and thence along the passage, until they
came to the street, and then the whole number of attendants was plainly
discernible.

     How different was the funeral of one who had friends.  He was alone; 
none
followed, save the undertaker and his attendants, all of whom looked solemn
from habit and professional motives.  Even the jocose man was a 
supernaturally
solemn as could be well imagined; indeed, nobody knew he was the same man.

     "Well," said the landlord, as he watched them down the street, as they
slowly paced their way with funeral, not sorrowful, solemnity-- "well, I am
very glad that it is all over."

     "It has been a sad plague to you," said one.

     "It has, indeed; it must be to any one who has had another such a job 
as
this.  I don't say it out of any disrespect to the poor man who is dead and
gone-- quite the reverse; but I would not have such another affair on my 
hands
for pounds."

     "I can easily believe you, especially when we come to consider the
disagreeables of a mob."

     "You may say that.  There's no knowing what they will or won't do,
confound them!  If they'd act like men, and pay for what they have, why, 
then
I shouldn't care much about them; but it don't do to have other people in 
the
bar."

     "I should think not, indeed; that would alter the scale of your 
profits,
I reckon."

     "It would make all the difference to me.  Business," added the 
landlord,
"conducted on that scale, would become a loss; and a man might as well walk
into a well at once."

     "So I should say.  Have many such occurrences as these been usual in 
this
part of the country?" inquired the stranger.

     "Not usual at all," said the landlord; "but the fact is, the whole
neighbourhood has run distracted about some superhuman being they call a
vampyre."

     "Indeed!" -- "Yes; and they suspected the unfortunate man who has been
lying up-stairs, a corpse, for some days."

     "Oh, the man they have just taken in the coffin to bury?" said the
stranger. -- "Yes, sir, the same."

     "Well, I thought perhaps somebody of great consequence had suddenly
become defunct." -- "Oh, dear no; it would not have caused half the 
sensation;
people have been really mad."

     "It was a strange occurrence, altogether, I believe, was it?" inquired
the stranger. -- "Indeed it was, sir.  I hardly know the particulars, there
have been so many tales afloat; though they all concur in one point, and 
that
is, it has destroyed the peace of one family."

     "Who had done so?" -- "The vampyre."

     "Indeed! I never heard of such an animal, save as a fable, before; it
seems to me extraordinary."

     "So it would do to any one, sir, as was not on the spot, to see it;  
I'm
sure I wouldn't."

                    *      *      *      *      *      *
                    
     In the meantime, the procession, short as it was of itself, moved along                    
in slow time through a throng of people who ran out of their houses on 
either
side of the way, and lined the whole length of the town.

     Many of these closed in behind, and followed the mourners until they 
were
near the church, and then they made a rush to get into the churchyard.

     As yet all had been conducted with toerable propriety, the funeral met
with no impediment.  The presence of death among so many of them seemed some
check upon the license of the mob, who bowed in silence to the majesty of
death.

     Who could bear ill-will against him who was now no more?  Man, while he
is man, is always the subject of hatred, fear, or love.  Some one of these
passions, in a modified state, exists in all men, and with such feelings 
they
will regard each other; and it is barely possible that any one should not be
the object of some of these, and hence the stranger's corpse was treated 
with
respect.

     In silence the body proceeded along the highway until it came to the
churchyard, and followed by an immense multitude of people of all grades.

     The authorities trembled; they knew not what all this portended.  They
thought it might pass off; but it might become a storm first; they hoped and
feared by turns, till some of them fell sick with apprehension.

     There was a deep silence observed by all those in the immediate 
vicinity
of the coffin, but those farther in the rear found full expression for their
feelings.

     "Do you think," said an old man to another, "that he will come to life
again, eh?" -- "Oh, yes, vampyres always do, and lay in the moonlight, and
then they come to life again.  Moonlight recovers a vampyre to life again."

     "And yet the moonlight is cold." -- "Ah, but who's to tell what may
happen to a vampyre, or what's hot or what's cold?"

     "Certainly not; oh, dear, no." -- "And then they have permission to 
suck
the blood of other people, to live themselves, and to make other people
vampyres, too."

     "The lord have mercy upon us!" -- "Ay, but they have driven a stake
through this one, and he can't get in moonlight or daylight; it's all over--
he's certainly done for; we may congratulate ourselves on this point."

     "So we may-- so we may."

     They now neared the grave, the clergyman officiating as usual on such
occasions.  There was a large mob of persons on all sides, with serious 
faces,
watching the progress of the ceremony, and who listened in quietness.

     There was no sign of any disturbance amongst the people, and the
authorities were well pleased; they congratulated themselves upon the
quietness and orderliness of the assemblage.

     The service was ended and the coffin lowered, and the earth was thrown 
on
the coffin-lid with a hollow sound.  Nobody could hear that sound unmoved. 
But in a short while the sound ceased as the grave became filled; it was 
then
trodden carefully down.

     There were no relatives there to feel affected at the last scene of 
all. 
They were far away, and, according to popular belief upon the subject, they
must have been dead some ages.
                              
                    *      *      *      *      *      *

     The mob watched the last shovel-full of earth thrown upon the coffin, 
and
witnessed the ramming down of the soil, and the heaping of it over at top to
make the usual monument; for all this was done speedily and carefully, lest
there should be any tendency to exhume the body of the deceased.

     The people were now somewhat relieved, as to their state of solemnity 
and
silence.  They would all of them converse freely on the matter that had so
long occupied their thoughts.

     They seemed now let loose, and everybody found himself at liberty to 
say
or do something, no matter if it were not very reasonable; that is not 
always
required of human beings who have souls, or, at least, it is unexpected; and
were it expected, the expectation would never be realized.

     The day was likely to wear away without a riot, nay, even without a
fight; a most extraordinary occurrence for such a place, under the existing
circumstances; for of late the populace, or perhaps, the townspeople, were
extremely pugnacious, and many were the disputes that were settled by the 
very
satisfactory application of the knuckles to the head of the party holding a
contrary opinion.

     Thus it was they were ready to take fire, and a hubbub would be the
result of the slightest provocation.  But, on the present occasion, there 
was
a remarkable dearth of all subjects of the nature described.

     Who was to lead Israel out to battle?  Alas! no one on the present
occasion.

     Such a one, however, appeared; at least, one who furnished a ready 
excuse
for a disturbance.

     Suddenly, Mrs. Chillingworth appeared in the midst of a large concourse
of people.  She had just left her house, which was close at hand; her eyes 
red
with weaping, and her children around her on this occasion.  The crowd made
way for her, and gathered round her to see what was going to happen.

     "Friends and neighbours," she said, "can any of you relieve the tears 
of
a distressed wife and mother; have any of you seen anything of my husband,
Mr. Chillingworth?"

     "What the doctor?" exclaimed one. -- "Yes; Mr. Chillingworth, the
surgeon.  He has not been home two days and a night.  I'm distracted! -- 
what
can have become of him I don't know, unless---"

     Here Mrs. Chillingworth paused; and some person said,--

     "Unless what, Mrs. Chillingworth? there are none but friends here, who
wish the doctor well, and would do anything to serve him-- unless what? 
speak
out."

     "Unless he's been destroyed by the vampyre.  Heaven knows what we may 
all
come to!  Here am I and my children deprived of our protector by some means
which we cannot imagine.  He never, in all his life, did the same before."

     "He must have been spirited away by some of the vampyres.  I'll tell 
you
what, friend," said one to another, "that something must be done; nobody's
safe in their bed."

     "No; they are not, indeed.  I think that all vampyres ought to be 
burned
and a stake run through them, and then we should be safe."

     "Ay; but you must destroy all those who are even suspected of being
vampyres, or else one may do all the mischief." -- "So he might."

     "Hurrah! shouted the mob.  "Chillingworth for ever!  We'll find the
doctor somewhere, if we pull down the whole town."

     "There was an immense commotion among the populace, who began to start
throwing stones, and do all sorts of things without any particular object, 
and
some, as they said, to find the doctor, or to show how willing they were to 
do
so if they knew how.

     Mrs. Chillingworth, however, kept on talking to the mob, who continued
shouting; and the authorities anticipated an immediate outbreak of popular
opinion, which is generally accompanied by some forcible demonstration, and 
on
this occasion some one suggested the propriety of burning down Bannerworth
Hall; because they had burned down the vampyre's house, and they might as
well burn down that of the injured party, which was carried by acclamation;
and with loud shouts they started on their errand.

     "This was a mob's proceeding all over, and we regret very much to say,
that it is very much the characteristic of English mobs.  What an uncommonly
strange thing it is that people in multitudes seem completely to get rid of
all reason-- all honour-- all common ordinary honesty; while, if you were to
take the same people singly, you would find that they were reasonable 
enough,
and would shrink with a feeling quite approaching to horror from anything in
the shape of very flagrant injustice.

     This can only be accounted for by a piece of cowardice in the human 
race,
which induces them when alone, and acting with the full responsibility of 
their actions, to shrink from what it is quite evident they have a full
inclination to do, and will do when, having partially lost their 
individuality
in a crowd, they fancy, that to a certain extent they can do so with 
impunity.

     The burning of Sir Francis Varney's house, although it was one of those
proceedings which would not bear the test of patient examination, was yet,
when we take all the circumstances into consideration, an act really 
justifiable and natural in comparison with the one which was now meditated.

     Bannerworth Hall had never been the residence even of any one who had
done the people any injury or given them any offence, so that to let it 
become
a prey to the flames was but a gratuitous act of mischief.

     It was, however, or seemed to be, doomed, for all who have had any
experience in mobs, must know how extremely difficult it is to withdraw them
from any impulse once given, especially when that impulse, as in the present
instance, is of a violent character.

     "Down with Bannerworth Hall!" was the cry.  "Burn it -- burn it," and
augmented by fresh numbers each minute, the ignorant, and, in many respects,
ruffianly assemblage, soon arrived within sight of what had been for so many
years the bane of the Bannerworths, and whatever may have been the fault of
some of that race, those faults had been of a domestic character, and not at
all such as would interfere with the public weal.

     The astonished, and almost worn-out authorities, hastily, now, after
having disposed of their prisoners, collected together what troops they 
could,
and by the time the misguided, or rather the not guided at all populace, had
got half way to Bannerworth Hall, they were being outflanked by some of the
dragoons, who, by taking a more direct route, hoped to reach Bannerworth 
Hall
first, and so perhaps, by letting the mob see that it was defended, induce
them to give up the idea of its destruction on account of the danger 
attendant
upon the proceeding by far exceeding any of the anticipated delight of the
disturbance.

 Next Time: The Strange Meeting at the Hall Between Mr. Chillingworth and 
the
 Mysterious Friend of Varney.




                                Chapter LXXI.

THE STRANGE MEETING AT THE HALL BETWEEN MR. CHILLINGWORTH AND THE MYSTERIOUS
FRIEND OF VARNEY.


     When we praise our friend Mr. Chillingworth for not telling his wife
where he was going, in pursuance of a caution and a discrimination so highly
creditable to him, we are quite certain that he has no such excuse as 
regards
the reader.  Therefore we say at once that he had his own reasons now for
taking up his abode at Bannerwoth Hall for a time.  These reasons seemed to 
be
all dependant upon the fact of having met the mysterious man at Sir Francis
Varney's; and although we perhaps would have hoped that the doctor might 
have
communicated to Henry Bannerworth all that he knew and all that he surmised,
yet have we no doubt that what he keeps to himself he has good reasons for 
so
keeping, and that his actions as regards it are founded upon some very just
conclusions.

     He has then made a determination to take possession of, and remain in,
Bannerworth Hall according to the full and free leave which the admiral had
given him so to do.  What results he anticipated from so lonely and so 
secret
a watch we cannot say, but probably they will soon exhibit themselves.  It
needed no sort of extraordinary discrimination for any one to feel at once 
that not the least good, in the way of an ambuscade, was likely to be 
effected
 by such persons as Admiral Bell or Jack Pringle.  They were all very well
when fighting should actually ensue, but they both were certainly remarkably
and completely deficient in diplomatic skill, or in that sort of patience
which should enable them at all to compete with the cunning, the skill, and
the nice discrimination of such a man as Sir Francis Varney.

     If anything were to be done in that way it was unquestionably to be 
done
by some one alone, who, like the doctor, would, and could, remain profoundly
quiet and await the issue of events, be they what they might, and probably
remain a spy and attempt no overt act which should be of a hostile 
character. 
This unquestionably was the mode, and perhaps we should not be going too far
when we say it was the only mode which could be with anything like safety
relied upon as one likely to lead really to a discovery of Sir Francis
Varney's motives in making such determined exertions to get possession of
Bannerworth Hall.

     That night was doomed to be a very eventful one, indeed; for on it had
Charles Holland been, by a sort of wild impulsive generosity of Sir Francis
Varney, rescued from the miserable dungeon in which he had been confined, 
and
on that night, too, he, whom we cannot otherwise describe than as the 
villain
Marchdale, had been, in consequence of the evil that he himself meditated, 
and
the crime with which he was quite willing to stain his soul, been condemned 
to
occupy Charles's position.

     On that night, too, had the infuriated mob determined upon the
destruction of Bannerworth Hall, and on that night was Mr. Chillingworth
waiting with what patience he could exert, at the Hall, for whatever in the
chapter of accidents might turn up of an advantageous character to that 
family
in whose welfare and fortunes he felt so friendly and so deep an interest.

     Let us look, then, at the worthy doctor as he keeps his solitary watch.

     He did not, as had been the case when the admiral shared the place with
him in the hope of catching Varney on that memorable occasion when he caught
only his boot, sit in a room with a light and the means and appliances for
making the night pass pleasantly away; but, on the contrary, he abandoned 
the
house altogether, and took up a station in that summer-house which has been
before mentioned as the scene of a remarkable interview between Flora
Bannerworth and Varney the vampyre.

     Alone and in the dark, so that he could not be probably seen, he 
watched
that one window of the chamber where the first appearance of the hideous
vampyre had taken place, and which seemed ever since to be the special 
object
of his attack.

     By remaining from twilight, and getting accustomed to the gradually
increasing darkness of the place, no doubt the doctor was able to see well
enough without the aid of any artificial light whether any one was in the
place besides himself.

     "Night after night," he said, "will I watch here until I have succeeded
in unravelling this mystery; for that there is some fearful and undreamt of
mystery at the bottom of all these proceedings I am well convinced."

     When he made such a determination as this, Dr. Chillingworth was not at
all a likely man to break it, so there, looking like a modern statue in the
arbour, he sat with his eyes fixed upon the balcony and the window of what
used to be called Flora's room for some hours.

     The doctor was a contemplative man, and therefore he did not so acutely
feel the loneliness of his position as many persons would have done; 
moreover,
he was decidedly not of a superstitious turn of mind, although certainly we
cannot deny an imagination to him.  However, if he really had harboured some
strange fears and terrors they would have been excusable, when we consider 
how
many circumstances had combined to make it almost a matter of demonstration
that Sir Francis Varney was something more than mortal.

     What quantities of subjects the doctor thought over during his vigil in
that garden it is hard to say, but never in his whole life, probably, had he
such a glorious opportunity for the most undisturbed contemplation of 
subjects
requiring deep thought to analyze, than as he had then.  At least he felt 
that
since his marriage he had never been so thoroughly quiet, and left so
completely to himself.

     It is to be hoped that he succeeded in settling any medical points of a
knotty character that might be hovering in his brain, and certain it is that
he had become quite absorbed in an abstruse matter connected with 
physiology,
when his ears were startled, and he was at once aroused to a full
consciousness of where he was, and why he had come there, by the distant 
sound
of a man's footstep.

     It was a footstep which seemed to be that of a person who scarcely
thought it at all necessary to use any caution, and the doctor's heart 
leaped
within him as in the lowest possible whisper he said to himself, --

     "I am successful-- I am successful.  It is believed now that the Hall 
is
deserted, and no doubt that is Sir Francis Varney come with confidence, to
carry out his object in so sedulously attacking it, be that object what it
may."

     Elated with this idea, the doctor listened intently to the advancing
footstep, which each moment sounded more clearly upon his ears.

     It was evidently approaching from the garden entrance towards the 
house,
and he thought, by the occasional deadened sound of the person's feet, be he
whom he might, that he could not see his way very well, and, consequently,
frequently strayed from the path, on to some of the numerous flowerbeds 
which
were in the way.

     "Yes," said the doctor, exultingly, "it must be Varney; and now I have
but to watch him, and not to resist him; for what good on earth is it to 
stop
him in what he wishes to do, and, by such means, never wrest his secret from
him.  The only way is to let him go on, and that will I do, most certainly."

     Now he heard the indistinct muttering of the voice of some one, so low
that he could not catch what words were uttered; but he fancied that, in the
deep tones, he recognised, without any doubt, the voice of Sir Francis 
Varney.

     "It must be he," he said, "it surely must be he.  Who else would come
here to disturb the solitude of an empty house?  He comes! he comes!"

     Now the doctor could see a figure emerge from behind some thick 
beeches,
which had before obstructed his vision, and he looked scrutinisingly about,
while some doubts stole slowly over his mind now as to whether it was the
vampyre or not.  The height was in favour of the supposition that it was 
none
other than Varney; but the figure looked so much stouter, that Mr.
Chillingworth felt a little staggered upon the subject, and unable wholly to
make up his mind upon it.

     The pausing of this visitor, too, opposite that window where Sir 
Francis
Varney had made his attempts, was another strong reason why the doctor was
inclined to believe it must be him, and yet he could not quite make up his
mind upon the subject, so as to speak with certainty.

     A very short time, however, indeed, must have sufficed to set such a
question as that at rest; and patience seemed the only quality of mind
necessary under those circumstances for Mr. Chillingworth to exert.

     The visitor continued gazing either at that window, or at the whole 
front
of the house, for several minutes, and then he turned away from a
contemplation of it, and walked slowly along, parallel with the windows of
that dining-room, one of which had been broken so completely on the occasion
of the admiral's attempt to take the vampyre prisoner.

     The moment the stranger altered his position, from looking at the 
window,
and commenced walking away from it, Mr. Chillingworth's mind was made up.  
It
was not Varney -- of that he felt now most positively assured, and could 
have
no doubt whatever upon the subject.

     The gait, the general air, the walk, all were different; and then arose
the anxious question of who could it be that had intruded upon that lonely
place, and what could be the object of any one else but Varney the vampyre 
to
do so.

     The stranger looked a powerful man, and walked with a firm tread, and,
altogether, he was an opponent that, had the doctor been ever so 
belligerently
inclined, it would have been the height of indiscretion for him to attempt 
to
cope with.

     It was a very vexatious thing, too, for any one to come there at such a
juncture, perhaps only from motives of curiosity, or possibly just to
endeavour to commit some petty depredations upon the deserted building, if
possible; and mostly heartily did the doctor wish that, in some way, he 
could
scare away the intruder.

     The man walked along very slowly, indeed, and seemed to be quite taking
his time in making his observations of the building; and this was the more
provoking, as it was getting late, and, if having projected a visit at all, 
it
would surely soon be made, and then, when he found any one there, of course,
he would go.

     Amazed beyond expression, the doctor felt about on the ground at his
feet, until he found a tolerably large stone, which he threw at the stranger
with so good an aim, that it hit him a smart blow on the back, which must 
have
been anything but a pleasant surprise.

     That it was a surprise, and that, too, a most complete one, was evident
from the start which the man gave, and then he uttered a furious oath, and
rubbed his back, as he glanced about him to endeavour to ascertain from 
whence
the missile had come.

     "I'll try him again with that," thought the doctor; "it may succeed in
scaring him away;" and he stooped to search for another stone.

     It was well that he did so at that precise moment; for, before he rose
again, he heard the sharp report of a pistol, and a crashing sound among 
some
of the old wood work of which the summer-house was composed, told him that a
shot had there taken effect.  Affairs were now getting much too serious; 
and,
accordingly, Dr. Chillingworth thought that, rather than stay there to be 
made
a target of, he would face the intruder.

     "Hold-- hold!" he cried.  "Who are you, and what do you mean by that?" 
--
"Oh! somebody is there," cried the man, as he advanced.  "My friend, whoever
you are, you were very foolish to throw a stone at me."

     "And, my friend, whoever you are," responded the doctor, "you were very
spiteful to fire a pistol bullet at me in consequence." -- "Not at all."

     "But I say yes; for, probably, I can prove a right to be here, which 
you
cannot." -- "Ah!" said the stranger, "that voice-- why-- you are Dr.
Chillingworth?"

     "I am; but I don't know you," said the doctor, as he emerged now from 
the
summer-house, and confronted the stranger, who was within a few paces of the
entrance to it.  Then he started, as he added, --

     "Yes, I do know you, though.  How in the name of Heaven, came you here,
and what purpose have you in so coming?"

     "What purpose have you?  Since we met at Varney's, I have been making
some inquiries about this neighbourhood, and learn strange things." -- "That
you may very easily do here; and, what is more extraordinary, the strange
things are, for the most part, I can assure you, quite true."

     The reader will, from what has been said, now readily recognise this 
man
as Sir Francis Varney's mysterious visitor, to whom he gave, from some 
hidden
cause or another, so large a sum of money, and between whom and Dr.
Chillingworth a mutual recognition had taken place, on the occasion when Sir
Francis Varney had, with such cool assurance, invited the admiral to 
breakfast
with him at his new abode.

     "You, however," said the man, "I have no doubt, are fully qualified to
tell me of more than I have been able to learn from other people; and, first
of all, let me ask you why you are here?" -- "Before I answer you that
question, or any other," said the doctor, "let me beg of you to tell me 
truly,
is Sir Francis Varney ----"

     The doctor whispered in the ear of the stranger some name, as if he
feared, even there, in the silence of that garden, where everything 
conspired
to convince him that he could not be overheard, to pronounce it in an 
audible
tone.

     "He is," said the other. -- "You have no manner of doubt of it?"

     "Doubt? -- certainly not.  What doubt can I have?  I know it for a
positive certainty, and he knows, of course, that I do know it, and has
purchased my silence pretty handsomely, although I must confess that nothing
but my positive necessities would have induced me to make the large demands
upon him that I have, and I hope soon to be able to release him altogether
from them."

     The doctor shook his head repeatedly, as he said, --

     "I suspected it; I suspected it, do you know, from the first moment 
that
I saw you there in his house.  His face haunted me ever since-- awfully
haunted me; and yet, although I felt certain that I had once seen it under
strange circumstances, I could not identify it with-- but no matter, no
matter.  I am waiting here for him."

     "Indeed!" -- "Ay, that I am; and I flung a stone at you, not knowing 
you,
with a hope that you would be, by such means, perhaps, scared away, and so
leave the coast clear for him."

     "Then you have an appointment with him?" -- "By no means; but he has 
made
such repeated and determined attacks upon this house that the family who
inhabited it were compelled to leave it, and I am here to watch him, and
ascertain what can possibly be his object."

     "It is as I suspected, then," muttered this man.  "Confound him!  Now 
can
I read, as if in a book, most clearly, the game that he is playing!"

     "Can you?" cried the doctor, energetically-- "can you?  What is it?  
Tell
me, for that is the very thing I want to discover." -- "You don't say so?"

     "It is, indeed; and I assure you that it concerns the peace of a whole
family to know it.  You say you have made inquiries about this 
neighbourhood,
and, if you have done so, you have discovered how the family of the
Bannerworths have been persecuted by Varney, and how, in particular, Flora
Bannerworth, a beautiful and intelligent girl, has been most cruelly made to
suffer."

     "I have heard all that, and I dare say with many exaggerations." -- "It
would be difficult for any one really to exaggerate the horrors that have
taken place in this house, so that any information which you can give
respecting the motives of Varney will tend, probably, to restore peace to
those who have been so cruelly persecuted, and be an act of kindness which I
think not altogether inconsistent with your nature."

     "You think so, and yet know who I am." -- "I do, indeed."

     "And what I am.  Why if I were to go into the market-place of yon town,
and proclaim myself, would not all shun me-- ay, even the lowest and vilest;
and yet you talk of an act of kindness not being altogether inconsistent 
with
my nature!" -- "I do, because I know something more of you than many."

     There was a silence of some moments' duration, and then the stranger
spoke in a tone of voice which looked as if he were struggling with some
emotion.

     "Sir, you do know more of me than many.  You know what I have been, and
you know how I left an occupation which would have made me loathed.  But 
you--
even you-- do not know what made me take to so terrible a trade." -- "I do
not."

     "Would it suit you for me now to tell you?" -- "Will you first promise 
me
that you will do all you can for this persecuted family of the Bannerworths,
in whom I take so strange an interest?"

     "I will.  I promise you that freely.  Of my own knowledge, of course, I
can say but little concerning them, but, upon that warranting, I well 
believe
they deserve abundant sympathy, and from me they shall have it."

     "A thousand thanks!  With your assistance, I have little doubt of being
able to extricate them form the tangled web of dreadful incidents which has
turned them from their home; and now, whatever you may choose to tell me of
the cause which drove you to be what you became, I shall listen to with
abundant interest.  Only let me beseech you to come into this summer-house,
and to talk low."

     "I will, and you can pursue your watch at the same time, while I 
beguile
its weariness." -- "Be it so."

     "You knew me years ago, when I had all the chances in the world of
becoming respectable and respected.  I did, indeed; and you may, therefore,
judge of my surprise when, some years since, being in the metropolis, I met
you, and you shunned my company." -- "Yes; but, at last, you found out why 
it
was that I shunned your company."

     "I did.  You yourself told me once that I met you, and would not leave
you, but insisted upon your dining with me.  Then you told me, when you 
found
that I would take no other course whatever, that you were no other than the-
-
the ----" -- "Out with it!  I can bear to hear it now better than I could
then!  I told you that I was the common hangman of London!"

     "You did, I must confess, to my most intense surprise."

     "Yes, and yet you kept to me; and, but that I respected you too much to
allow you to do so, you would, from old associations, have countenanced me;
but I could not, and I would not, let you do so.  I told you then that,
although I held the terrible office, that I had not been yet called upon to
perform its loathsome functions.  Soon-- soon-- come the first effort-- it 
was
the last!"

     "Indeed!  You left the dreadful trade?" -- "I did-- I did.  But what I
want to tell you, for I could not then, was why I went ever to it.  The 
wounds
my heart had received were then too fresh to allow me to speak of them, but 
I
will tell you now.  The story is a brief one, Mr. Chillingworth.  I pray you
be seated."

 Next Time: The Strange Story. -- The Arrival of the Mob at the Hall, and
 Their Dispersion.




                               Chapter LXXII.

THE STRANGE STORY. -- THE ARRIVAL OF THE MOB AT THE HALL, AND THEIR
DISPERSION.


     "You will find that the time which elapsed since I last saw you in
London, to have been spent in an eventful, varied manner." -- "You were in
good circumstances then," said Mr. Chillingworth. -- "I was, but many events
happened after that which altered the prospect; made it even more gloomy 
than
you can well imagine: but I will tell you all candidly, and you can keep 
watch
upon Bannerworth Hall at the same time.  You are well aware that I was well 
to
do, and had ample funds, and inclination to spend them." -- "I recollect: 
but
you were married then, surely?" -- "I was," said the stranger, sadly, "I was
married then." -- "And now?" -- "I am a widower."  The stranger seemed much
moved, but, after a moment or so, he resumed-- "I am a widower now; but how
that event came about is partly my purpose to tell you.  I had not married
long-- that is very long-- for I have but one child, and she is not old, or 
of
an age to know much more than what she may be taught; she is still in the
course of education.  I was early addicted to gamble; the dice had its 
charms,
as all those who have ever engaged in play but too well know; it is 
perfectly
fascinating." -- "So I have heard," said Mr. Chillingworth; "though, for
myself, I found a wife and professional pursuits quite incompatible with any
pleasure that took either time or resources." -- "It is so.  I would I had
never entered one of those houses where men are deprived of their money and
their own free will, for at the gambling table you have no liberty, save 
that
in gliding down the stream in company with others.  How few have ever 
escaped
destruction-- none, I believe-- men are perfectly fascinated; it is ruin 
alone
that enables a man to see how he has been hurried onwards without thought or
reflection; and how fallacious were all the hopes he ever entertained!  Yes,
ruin, and ruin alone, can do this; but alas! 'tis too late-- the evil is 
done.
Soon after my marriage I fell in with a Chevalier St. John.  He was a man of
the world in every sense of the word, and one that was well versed in all 
the
ways of society.  I never met with any man who was so perfectly master of
himself, and of perfect ease and self-confidence as he was.  He was never at 
a
loss, and, come what would, never betrayed surprise or vexation-- two
qualities, he thought, never ought to be shown by any man who moved in
society." -- "Indeed!" -- "He was a strange man-- a very strange man." -- 
"Did
he gamble?" -- "It is difficult to give you a correct and direct answer.  I
should say he did, and yet he never lost or won much; but I have often 
thought
he was more connected with those who did than was believed." -- "Was that a
fact?" inquired Mr. Chillingworth. -- "You shall see as we go on, and be 
able
to judge for yourself.  I have thought he was.  Well, he first took me to a
handsome saloon, where gambling was carried on.  We had been to the opera.  
As
we came out, he recommended that we should sup at a house where he was well
known, and where he was in the habit of spending his evenings after the 
opera,
and before he retired.  I agreed to this.  I saw no reason why I should not. 
We went there, and bitterly have I repented of so doing for years since, and
do to this day." -- "Your repentance has been sincere and lasting," said Mr.
Chillingworth; "the one proves the other." -- "It does; but I thought not so
then.  The place was glittering, and the wine was good.  It was a kind of
earthly paradise; and when we had taken some wine, the chevalier said to 
me,--

     "'I am desirous of seeing a friend backwards; he is at the hazard-
table. 
Will you go with me?' -- I hesitated.  I feared to see the place where a 
vice
was carried on.  I knew myself inclined to prudential motives.  I said to
him,-- 'No, St. John, I'll wait here for you; it may be as well-- the wine 
is
good, and it will content me?'

     "'Do so,' he said, smiling; 'but remember I seldom or never play 
myself,
nor is there any reason why you should.' -- 'I'll go, but I will not play.' 
--
'Certainly not; you are free alike to look on, play, or quit the place at 
any
moment you please, and not be noticed, probably, by a single soul.'

     "I arose, and we walked backwards, having called one of the men who 
were
waiting about, but who were watchers and doorkeepers of the 'hell.'  We were
led along the passage, and passed through the pair of doors, which were well
secured and rendered the possibility of a surprise almost impossible.  After
these dark places, we were suddenly let into a place where we were dazzled 
by
the light and brilliancy of the saloon.  It was not so large as the one we
left, but it was superior to it in all its appointments.

     "At first I could not well see who was, or who was not, in the room 
where
we were.  As soon, however, as I found the use of my eyes, I noticed many
well-dressed men, who were busily engaged in play, and who took no notice of
any one who entered.  We walked about for some minutes without speaking to 
any
one, but merely looking on.  I saw men engaged in play; some with 
earnestness,
others again with great nonchalance, and money changed hands without the 
least
remark.  There were but few who spoke, and only those in play.  There was a
hum of conversation; but you could not distinguish what was said, unless you
paid some attention to, and was in close vicinity with, the individual who
spoke.

     "'Well,' said St. John, 'what do you think of this place?' -- 'Why,' I
replied, 'I had no notion of seeing a place fitted up as this is.'

     "'No; isn't it superb?' -- 'It is beautifully done.  They have many
visitors,' said I, 'many more than I could have believed.'

     "'Yes, they are all _bona fide_ players; men of stamp and rank -- none 
of
your seedy legs who have only what they can cheat you out of.' -- 'Ah!' --
'And besides,' he added, 'you may often form friendships here that lead to
fortune hereafter.  I do not mean in play, because there is no necessity for
your doing so, or, if yo do so, in going above a stake which you know won't
hurt you.' -- 'Exactly.'

     "'Many men can never approach a table like this, and sit down to an
hour's play, but, if they do, they must stake not only more than they can
afford, but all their property, leaving themselves beggars.'  'They do?' 
said
I.

     "'But men who know themselves, their resources, and choose to indulge 
for
a long time, many often come and lay the foundation to a very pretty 
fortune.'

     "'Do you see your friend?' I inquired. -- 'No, I do not; but I will
inquire if he has been here-- if not, we will go.'

     "He left me for a moment or two to make some inquiry, and I stood 
looking
at the table, where there were four players, and who seemed to be engaged at 
a
friendly game; and when one party won they looked grave, and when the other
party lost they smiled and looked happy.  I walked away, as the chevalier 
did
not return immediately to me; and then I saw a gentleman rise up from a 
table.
 He had evidently lost.  I was standing by the seat, unconsciously holding 
the
back of my hand.  I sat down without thinking or without speaking, and found
myself at the hazard table.

     "'Do you play, sir?' -- 'Yes,' I said.  I had hardly uttered the words
when I was sorry for them; but I could not recall them.  I sat down, and 
play
at once commenced.

     "In about ten or fifteen minutes, often losing and then winning, I 
found
myself about a hundred and twenty pounds in pocket, clear gain by the play.

     "'Ah!' said the chevalier, who came up at that moment, 'I thought you
wouldn't play.' -- 'I really don't know how it happened,' said I, 'but I
suddenly found myself here without any previous intention.'

     "'You are not a loser, I hope?' -- 'Indeed I am not,' I replied; 'but 
not
much a gainer.'

     "'Nor need you desire to be.  Do you desire to give your adversary his
revenge now, or take another opportunity.' -- 'At another time,' I replied.

     "'You will find me here the day after to-morrow, when I shall be at 
your
service; then bowing, he turned away.

     "'He is a very rich man whom you have been playing with,' said the
chevalier. -- 'Indeed!'

     "'Yes, and I have known him to lose for three days together; but you 
may
take his word for any amount; he is a perfect gentleman and man of honour.' 
--
''Tis well to play with such,' I replied; 'but I suppose you are about to
leave.'

     "'Yes, it grows late, and I have some business to transact to-morrow, 
so
I must leave.' -- 'I will accompany you part of the way home.' said I, 'and
then I shall have finished the night.'

     "I did leave with him, and accompanied him home, and then walked to my
own home.            

                     *          *          *          *

     "This was my first visit, and I thought a propitious beginning, but it
was the more dangerous.  Perhaps a loss might have effectually deterred me,
but it doubtful to tell how certain events might have been altered.  It is
just possible that I might have been urged on by my desire to retrieve any
loss I might have incurred, and so made myself at once the miserable being 
it
took months to accomplish in bringing me to.

     "I went the day but one after this, to meet the same individual at the
gambling-table, and played some time with varied success, until I left off
with a trifling loss upon the night's play, which was nothing of any
consequence.

     "Thus matters went on; I sometimes won and sometimes lost, until I won 
a
few hundreds, and this determined me to play for higher stakes than any I 
had
yet played for.

     "It was no use going on in the peddling style I had been going on; I 
had
won two hundred and fifty pounds in three months, and had I been less 
fearful
I might have had twenty-five thousand pounds.  Ah!  I'll try my fortune at a
higher game.

     "Having once made this resolution, I was anxious to begin my new plan,
which I hoped would have the effect of placing me far above my then present
position in society, which was good, and with a little attention it would 
have
made me an independent man; but then it required patience, and nothing more. 
However, the other method was so superior since it might all be done with 
good
luck in a few months.  Ah! good luck; how uncertain is good luck; how
changeful is fortune; how soon is the best prospect blighted by the frosts 
of
adversity.  In less than a month I had lost more than I could pay, and then 
I
gambled on for a living.

     "My wife had but one child; her first and only one; an infant at her
breast; but there was a change came over her; for one had come over me-- a
fearful one it was too-- one not only in manner but in fortune too.  She 
would
beg me to come home early; to attend to other matters, and leave the 
dreadful
life I was then leading.

     "'Lizzy,' said I, 'we are ruined.' -- 'Ruined!' she exclaimed, and
staggered back, until she fell into a seat.  'Ruined!'

     "'Ay, ruined.  It is a short word, but expressive.' -- 'No, no, we are
not ruined.  I know what you mean, you would say, we cannot live as we have
lived; we must retrench, and so we will, right willingly.'

     "'You much retrench most wonderfully,' I said, with desperate calmness,
'for the murder must out.' -- 'And so we will; but you will be with us; you
will not go out night after night, ruining your health, our happiness, and
destroying both peace and prospects.'

     "'No, no, Lizzy, we have no chance of recovering ourselves; house and
home-- all gone-- all, all.' -- 'My God!' she exclaimed.

     "'Ay, rail on.' said I; 'you have cause enough; but, no matter-- we 
have
lost all.' -- 'How-- how?'

     "'It is useless to ask how; I have done, and there is an end of the
matter; you shall know more another day; we must leave this house for a
lodging.' -- 'It matters little,' she said; 'all may be won again, if you 
will
but say you will quit the society of those who have ruined you.'

     "'No one,' said I, 'has ruined me; I did it; it was no fault of any one
else's; I have not that excuse.' -- 'I am sure you can recover.'

     "'I may; some day fortune will shower her favours upon me, and I live 
on
in that expectation.' -- 'You cannot mean that you will chance the gaming-
table? for I am sure you must have lost all there?"

     "'I have.' -- 'God help me,' she said; 'you have done your child a 
wrong,
but you may repair it yet.'

     "'Never!' -- ''Tis a long day! let me implore you, on my knees, to 
leave
this place, and adopt some other mode of life; we can be careful; a little
will do, and we shall, in time, be equal to, and better than what we have
been.'

     "'We never can, save by chance.' -- 'And by chance we never shall,' she
replied; 'if you will exert yourself, we may yet retrieve ourselves.'

     "And exert myself I will.' -- 'And quit the gaming-table?'

     "'Ask me to make no promises,' said I; 'I may not be able to keep them;
therefore, ask me to make none.' -- 'I do ask you, beg of, entreat of you to
promise, and solemnly promise me that you will leave that fearful place, 
where
men not only lose all their goods, but the feelings of nature also.'

     "'Say no more, Lizzy; if I can get a living elsewhere I will, but if 
not,
I must get it there.'

     "She seemed to be cast down at this, and she shed tears.  I left the
room, and again went to the gambling-house, and there, that night, I won a 
few
pounds, which enabled me to take my wife and child away from the house they
had so long lived in, and took them afterwards to a miserable place, -- one
room, where, indeed, there were a few articles of furniture that I had saved
from the general wreck of my own property.

     "She took things much less to heart than I could have anticipated; she
seemed cheerful and happy, -- she endeavoured to make my home as comfortable
as she could.

     "Her whole endeavour was to make me, as much as possible, forget the
past.  She wanted, as much as possible, to wean me away from  my gambling
pursuits, but that was impossible.  I had no hope, no other prospect.

     "Thus she strove, but I could see each day she was getting paler, and
more pale; her figure, before round, was more thin, and betrayed signs of
emaciation.  This preyed upon me; and, when fortune denied me the means of
carrying home that which she so much wanted, I could never return for two 
days
at a time.  Then I would find her shedding tears, and sighing; what could I
say?  If I had anything to take her, then I used to endeavour to make her
forget that I had been away.

     "'Ah!' she would exclaim, 'you will find me dead one of these days; 
what
you do now for one or two days, you will do by-and-bye for many days, 
perhaps
weeks.' -- 'Do not anticipate evil.'

     "'I cannot do otherwise; were you in any other kind of employment but
that of gambling,' she said, 'I should have some hope of you; but, as it is,
there is none.' -- 'Speak not of it; my chances may turn out favourable yet,
and you may be again as you were.'

     "'Never.' -- 'But fortune is inconstant, and may change in my favour as
much as she has done in others.'

     "'Fortune is indeed constant, but misfortune is an inconstant." -- "You
are prophetic of evil."

     "'Ah! I would to Heaven I could predict good; but who ever yet heard of 
a
ruined gambler being able to retrieve himself by the same means that he was
ruined?'

     "Thus we used to converse, but our conversation was usually of but 
little
comfort to either of us, for we could give neither any comfort to the other;
and as that was usually the case, our interviews became less frequent, and 
of
less duration.  My answer was always the same.

     "'I have no other chance; my prospects are limited to that one place;
deprive me of that, and I never more should be able to bring you a mouthful 
of
bread.'

     "Day after day, -- day after day, the same result followed, and I was 
as
far from success as ever I was, and ever should be; I was yet a beggar.

     "The time flew by; my little girl was nearly four years old, but she 
knew
not the misery her father and mother had to endure.  The poor little thing
sometimes went without more than a meal a day; and while I was living thus
upon the town, upon the chances of the gaming table, many a pang did she 
cause
me, and so did her mother.  My constant consolation was this, --

     "'It is bad luck now,' I would say; 'but will be better by-and-bye;
things cannot always continue thus.  It is all for them-- all for them.'

     "I thought that by continuing constantly in one course, I must be at 
land
at the ebb of the tide.  'It cannot always flow one way,' I thought.  I had
often heard people say that if you could but have the resolution to play on,
you must in the end seize the turn of fortune.

     "'If I could but once do that, I would never enter a hell again as long
as I drew breath.'

     "This was a resolve I could not only make but keep, because I had
suffered so much that I would never run through the same misery again that I
had already gone through.  However, fortune never seemed inclined to take 
the
turn I had hoped for; fortune was as far off as ever, and had in no case 
given
me any opportunity of recovering myself.

     "A few pounds were the utmost I could at any time muster, and I had to
keep up something of an appearance, and seem as if I had a thousand a year;
when, God knows, I could not have mustered a thousandth part of that sum, 
were
all done and paid for.

     "Day after day passed on, and yet no change.  I had almost  given 
myself
up to despair, when one night when I went home I saw my wife was more than
usually melancholy and sad, and perhaps ill; I didn't look at her-- I seldom
did, because her looks were always a reproach to me; I could not help 
feeling
them so.

     "'Well,' said I, 'I have come home to you because I have something to
bring you; not what I ought-- but what I can-- you must be satisfied!' -- 'I
am,' she said.

     "'I know also you want it; how is the child, is she quite well?' -- 
'Yes,
quite.'

     "'Where is she?' inquired I, looking round the room, but I didn't see
her; she used to be up. -- 'She has gone to bed,' she said.

     "'It is very early.' -- 'Yes, but she cried so for food that I was
obliged to get her to sleep to forget her hunger; poor thing, she has wanted
bread very badly.'

     "'Poor thing!' I said, 'let her be awakened and partake of what I have
brought home.'

     "With that my wife waked her up, and the moment she opened her eyes she
again began to cry for food, which I immediately gave her, and saw her 
devour
with the utmost haste and hunger.  The sight smote my heart, and my wife sat
by watching, and endeavouring to prevent her from eating so fast.

     "'This is bad,' I said. -- 'Yes, but I hope it may be the worst,' she
replied, in a deep and hollow voice.

     "'Lizzy,' I exclaimed, 'what is the matter-- are you ill?' -- 'Yes, 
very
ill.'

     "'What is the matter with you?  For God's sake tell me,' I said, for I
was alarmed. -- 'I am very ill,' she said, 'very ill indeed; I feel my
strength decreasing every day.  I must drink.'

     "You, too, want food?' -- 'I have and perhaps do, though the desire to
eat seems almost to have left me.'

     "'For Heaven's sake eat,' said I; 'I will bring you home something more
by to-morrow; eat and drink Lizzy.  I have suffered; but for you and your
child's sake, I will do my best.' -- 'Your best,' she said, 'will kill us
both; but, alas, there is no other aid at hand.  You may one day, however,
come here too late to find us living.'

     "'Say no more, Lizzy, you know not my feelings when you speak thus; 
alas,
I have no hope-- no aid-- no friend.' -- 'No,' she replied, 'your love of
gaming drove them from you, because they would not aid a gambler.'

     "'Say no more, Lizzy,' I said; 'if there be not an end to this life 
soon,
there will be an end to me.  In two days more I shall return to you.  Good
bye; God bless you.  Keep up your heart and the child.' -- 'Good bye,' she
said, sorrowfully.  She shed tears, and wrung her hands bitterly.  I 
hastened
away-- my heart was ready to burst, and I could not speak.

     "I walked about to recover my serenity, but could not do so 
sufficiently
well to secure anything like an appearance that would render me fit to go to
the gaming-house.  That night I remained away, but I could not avoid falling
into a debauch to drown my misfortunes, and shift the scene of misery that 
was
continually before my eyes.

                     *          *          *          *

     "The next night I was at the gaming-house.  I went there in better than
usual spirits.  I saw, I thought, a change in fortune, and hailed that as 
the
propitious moment of my life, when I was to rise above my present 
misfortunes.

     "I played and won-- played and lost-- played and won, and then lost
again; thus I went on, fluctuating more and more, until I found I was 
getting
money in my pocket.  I had, at one moment, more than three hundred pounds in
my pocket, and I felt that then was my happy moment-- then the tide of 
fortune
was going in my favour.  I ought to have left off with that-- to have been
satisfied with such an amount of money; but the demon of avarice seemed to
have possessed me, and I went on and on with fluctuating fortune, until I 
lost
the whole of it.

     "I was mad-- desperate, and could have destroyed myself; but I thought 
of
the state my wife and child were in; I thought that that night they would 
want
food; but they cound not hurt for one day-- they must have some, or would
procure some.

     "I was too far gone to be able to go to them, even if I were possessed 
of
means; but I had none, and daylight saw me in a deep sleep, from which I 
awoke
not until the next evening set in, and then I once more determined that I
would make a desperate attempt to get a little money.  I had always paid, 
and
thought my word would be taken for once; and, if I won, all well and good; 
if
not, then I was no worse off than before.

     "This was easy to plan, but not to execute.  I went there, but there 
were
none present in whom I had sufficient interest to dare make the attempt.  I
walked about, and felt in a most uncomfortable state.  I feared I should not
succeed at all, then what was to become of me-- of my wife and child?  This
rendered me almost mad.  I could not understand what I was to do, what to 
attempt, or where to go.  One or two persons came up, and asked me if I were
ill.  My answers were, that I was well enough.  Good God! how far from the
truth was that; but I found I must place more control on my feelings, else I
should cause much conversation, and then I should lose all hope of 
recovering
myself, and all prospect of living, even.

     "At length some one did come in, and I remarked I had been there all 
the
evening, and had not played.  I had an invitation to play with him, which
ended, by a little sleight of hand, in my favour; and on that I had 
calculated
as much as on any good fortune I might meet.  The person I played with
observed it not, and, when we left off playing, I had some six or seven 
pounds
in pocket.  This, to me, was a very great sum; and, the moment I could
decently withdraw myself, I ran off home.

     "I was fearful of the scene that awaited me.  I expected something 
worse
than I had yet seen.  Possibly Lizzy might be angry, and scold as well as
complain.  I therefore tapped at the door gently, but heard no one answer; 
but
of this I took no notice, as I believed that they might be, and were, most
probably, fast asleep.  I had provided myself with a light, and I therefore
opened the door, which was not fastened.

     "'Lizzy!' said I, 'Lizzy!'  There was no answer given, and I paused. 
Everything was as still as death.  I looked on the bed-- there lay my wife
with her clothes on.

     "'Lizzy! Lizzy!' said I.  But still she did not answer me.

     "'Well,' said I, 'she sleeps sound;' and I walked towards the bed, and
placed my hand upon her shoulder, and began to shake her, saying, as I did 
so,
--

     "'Lizzy! Lizzy! I'm come home.'  But still no answer, or signs of
awaking.

     "I went on the other side of the bed to look at her face, and some
misgivings overtook me.  I trembled much.  She lay on the bed, with her back
towards the spot where I stood.

     "I came towards her face.  My hand shook violently as I endeavoured to
look at her.  She had her eyes wide open, as if staring at me.

     "'Lizzy,' said I.  No answer was returned.  I then placed my hand upon
her cheek.  It was enough, and I started back in great horror.  She was 
dead!

     "This was horror itself.  I staggered back and fell into a chair.  The
light I placed down, Heaven knows how or why; but there I sat staring at the
corpse of my unfortunate wife.  I can hardly tell you the tremendous effect
this had upon me.  I could not move.  I was fascinated to the spot.  I could
not move and could not turn.

                *          *          *          *          *

     "It was morning, and the rays of the sun illuminated the apartment; but
there sat I, still gazing upon the face of my unfortunate wife.  I saw, I 
knew
she was dead; but yet I had not spoken, but sat looking at her.

     "I believe my heart was as cold as she was; but extreme horror and 
dread
had dried up all the warm blood in my body, and I hardly think there was a
pulsation left.  The thoughts of my child never once seemed to cross my 
mind. 
I had, however, sat there long-- some hours before I was discovered, and 
this
was by the landlady.

     "I had left the door open behind me, and she, in passing down, had the
curiosity to peep, and saw me sitting in what she thought to be a very 
strange
attitude, and could hear no sounds.

     "After some time she discovered my wife was dead, and, for some time, 
she
thought me so, too.  However, she was convinced to the contrary, and then
began to call for assistance.  This awoke the child, which was nearly
famished.  The landlady, to become useful, and to awaken me from my 
lethargy,
placed the child in my hands, telling me I was the best person now to take
care of it.

     "And so I was; there was no doubt of the truth of that, and I was
compelled to acknowledge it.  I felt much pride and pleasure in my daughter,
and determined she should, if I starved, have the benefit of all I could do
for her in the way of care, &c.

                *          *          *          *          *

     "The funeral over, I took my child and carried it to a school, where I
left her, and paid in advance, promising to do so as often as the quarter 
came
round.  My wife I had seen buried by the hands of man, and I swore I would 
do
the best for my child, and to keep this oath was a work of pleasure.

     "I determined also I would never more enter a gaming-house, be the
extremity what it might; I would suffer even death before I would permit
myself to enter the house in which it took place.

     "'I will,' I thought, 'obtain some employment of some kind or other.  I
could surely obtain that.  I have only to ask and I have it, surely--
something, however menial, that would keep me and my child.  Yes, yes-- she
ought, she must have her charges paid at once.'

     "The effect of my wife's death was a very great shock to me, and such a
one I could not forget-- one I shall ever remember, and one that at least 
made
a lasting impression upon me.

                *          *          *          *          *

     "Strange, but true, I never entered a gambling-house; it was my horror
and my aversion.  And yet I could obtain no employment.  I took my daughter
and placed her at a boarding-school, and tried hard to obtain bread by 
labour;
but, do what I would, none could be had; if my soul depended upon it, I 
could
find none.  I cared not what it was-- anything that was honest.

     "I was reduced low-- very low; gaunt starvation showed itself in my
cheeks; but I wandered about to find employment; none could be found, and 
the
world seemed to have conspired together to throw me back to the gaming-
table.

     "But this I would not.  At last employment was offered; but what was 
it? 
The situation of common hangman was offered me.  The employment was 
disgusting
and horrible; but, at the same time, it was all I could get, and that was a
sufficient inducement for me to accept of it.  I was, therefore, the common
executioner; and in that employment for some time earned a living.  It was
terrible; but necessity compelled me to accept the only thing I could 
obtain.
You now know the reason why I became what I have told you."

 Next Time: The Visit of the Vampire. -- The General Meeting.




                               Chapter LXXIII.

THE VISIT OF THE VAMPIRE. -- THE GENERAL MEETING.


     "The mysterious friend of Mr. Chillingworth finished his narrative, and
then the doctor said to him,--

     "And that, then, is the real cause of why you, a man evidently far 
above
the position in life which is usually that of those who occupy the dreadful
post of executioner, came to accept of it." -- "The real reason, sir.  I
considered, too, that in holding such a humiliating situation that I was
justly served for the barbarity of which I had been guilty; for what can be 
a
greater act of cruelty than to squander, as I did, in the pursuit of mad
excitement, those means which should have rendered my home happy, and 
conduced
to the welfare of those who were dependant upon me?"

     "I do not mean to say that your self-reproaches are unjust altogether,
but--- What noise is that? do you hear anything? -- "Yes-- yes."

     "What do you take it to be?" -- "It seemed like the footsteps of a 
number
of persons, and it evidently approaches nearer and nearer.  I know not what 
to
think."

     "Shall I tell you?" said a deep-toned voice, and some one, through the
orifice in the back of the summer-house, which, it will be recollected,
sustained some damage at the time that Varney escaped from it, laid a hand
upon Mr. Chillingworth's shoulder.  "God bless me!" exclaimed the doctor;
"who's that?" and he sprang from his seat with the greatest perturbation in
the world.

     "Varney, the vampyre!" added the voice, and then both the doctor and 
his
companion recognised it, and saw the strange, haggard features, that now 
they
knew so well, confronting them.  There was a pause of surprise, for a moment
or two, on the part of the doctor, and then he said, "Sir Francis Varney, 
what
brings you here?  I conjure you to tell me, in the name of common justice 
and
common feeling, what brings you to this house so frequently?  You have
dispossessed the family, whose property it is, of it, and you have caused
great confusion and dismay over a whole county.  I implore you now, not in 
the
language of menace or as an enemy, but as the advocate of the oppressed, and
one who desires to see justice done to all, to tell me what it is you
require."

     "There is no time now for explanation," said Varney, "if explanations
were my full and free intent.  You wished to know what noise was that you
heard?"

     "I did; can you inform me?" -- "I can.  The wild and lawless mob which
you and your friends first induced to interfere in affairs far beyond their
or your control, are now flushed with the desire of riot and of plunder.  
The
noise you hear is that of their advancing footsteps; they come to destroy
Bannerworth Hall."

     "Can that be possible?  The Bannerworth family are the sufferers from 
all
that has happened, and not the inflictors of suffering." -- "Ay, be it so; 
but
he who once raises a mob has raised an evil spirit, which, in the majority 
of
cases, it requires a far more potent spell than he is master of to quell
again."

     "It is so.  That is a melancholy truth; but you address me, Sir Francis
Varney, as if I led on the mob, when in reality I have done all that lay in
my power, from the very first moment of their rising on account of this
affair, which, in the first instance, was your work, to prevent them from
proceeding to acts of violence." -- "It may be so; but if you have now any
regard for your own safety you will quit this place.  It will too soon 
become
the scene of a bloody contention.  A large party of dragoons are even now by
another route coming towards it, and it will be their duty to resist the
aggressions of the mob; then should the rioters persevere, you can guess the
result." -- "I can, indeed."

     "Retire then while you may, and against the bad deeds of Sir Francis
Varney at all events place some of his good ones, that he may not seem 
wholly
without one redeeming trait." -- "I am not accustomed," said the doctor, "to
paint the devil blacker than he really is; but yet the cruel persecutions 
that
the Bannerworth family have endured call aloud for justice.  You still, with
a perseverance which shows you regardless of what others suffer so that you
compass your own ends, hover round a spot which you have rendered desolate."

     "Hark, sir; do you not hear the tramp of horses' feet?" -- "I do."

     The noise made by the feet of the insurgents was now almost drowned in
the louder and more rapid tramp of the horses' feet of the advancing 
dragoons,
and, in a few momemts more, Sir Francis Varney waved his arm, exclaiming,--

     "They are here.  Will you not consult your safety by flight?" -- "No,"
said Mr. Chillingworth's companion; "we prefer remaining here at the risk 
even
of whatever danger may accrue to us."

     "Fools, would you die in a chance _melee_ between an infuriated 
populace
and soldiery?" -- "Do not leave," whispered the ex-hangman to Mr.
Chillingworth; "do not leave, I pray you.  He only wants to have the Hall to
himself."

     There could be no doubt now of the immediate appearance of the cavalry,
and, before Sir Francis Varney could utter another word, a couple of the
foremost of the soldiers cleared the garden fence at a part where it was 
low,
and alighted not many feet from the summer-house in which this short 
colloquy
was taking place.  Sir Francis Varney uttered a bitter oath, and immediately
disappeared in the gloom.

     "What shall we do?" said the hangman. -- "You can do what you like, but 
I
shall avow my presence to the military, and claim to be on their side in the
approaching  contest, if it should come to one, which I sincerely hope it 
will
not."

     The military detachment consisted of about twenty-five dragoons, who 
now
were all in the gardens.  An order was given by the officer in command for
them to dismount, which was at once obeyed, and the horses were fastened by
their bridles to the various trees with which the place abounded.

     "They are going to oppose the mob on foot, with their carbines," said 
the
the hangman; "there will be sad work here I am afraid." -- "Well, at all
events," said Mr. Chillingworth, "I shall decline acting the part of a spy
here any longer; so here goes."

     "Hilloa! a friend, -- a friend here, in the summer-house!"

     "Make it two friends," cried the hangman, "if you please, while you are
about it."

     A couple of the dragoons immediately appeared, and the doctor, with his
companion, were marched, as prisoners, before the officer in command.

     "What do you do here?" he said; "I was informed that the Hall was
deserted.  Here, orderly, whre is  Mr. Adamson, the magistrate, who came 
with
me?" -- "Close at hand, sir, and he says he's not well."

     "Well, or ill, he must come here, and do something with these people."

     A magistrate of the district who had accompanied the troops, and been
accommodated with a seat behind one of the dragoons, which seemed very much 
to
have disagreed with him, for he was as pale as death, now stepped forward.

     "You know me, Mr. Adamson?" said the doctor; "I am Mr. Chillingworth." 
--
"Oh! yes; Lord bless you! how came you here?"

     "Never mind that just now; you can vouch for my having no connection 
with
the rioters." -- "Oh! dear, yes; certainly.  This is a respectable 
gentleman,
Captain Richardson, and a personal friend of mine."

     "Oh! very good." -- "And I," said the doctor's companion, "am likewise 
a
respectable and useful memeber of society, and a great friend of Mr.
Chillingworth."

     "Well, gentlemen," said the captain in command, "you may remain here, 
if
you like, and take the chances, or you may leave."

     They intimated that they preferred remaining, and, almost at the moment
that they did so, a loud shout from many throats announced the near approach
of the mob. -- "Now, Mr. Magistrate, if you please," said the officer; "you
will be so good as to tell the mob that I am here with my troop, under your
orders, and strongly advise them to be off while they can, with whole skins,
for if they persevere in attacking the place, we must persevere in defending
it; and, if they have half a grain of sense among them, they can surely 
guess
what the result of that will be."

     "I will do the best I can, as Heaven is my judge," said the magistrate,
"to produce a peaceable result, -- more no man can do."

     "Hurrah! hurrah!" shouted the mob, "down with the Vampyre! down with 
the
Hall!" and then one, more candid than his fellows shouted,-- "Down with
everything and everybody!"

     "Ah!" remarked the officer; "that fellow now knows what he came about."

     A great number of torches and links were lighted by the mob, but the
moment the glare of light fell upon the helmets and accoutrements of the
military, there was a pause of consternation on the part of the multitude, 
and
Mr. Admason, urged on by the officer, who, it was evident, by no means liked
the service he was on, took advantage of the opportunity, and, stepping
forward, he said,--

     "My good people, and fellow townsmen, let me implore you to listen to
reason, and go to your homes in peace.  If you do not, but, on the contrary,
in defiance of law and good order, persist in attacking this house, it will
become my painful duty to read the riot act, and then the military and you
will have to fight it out together, which I beg you will avoid, for you know
that some of you will be killed, and a lot more of you receive painful 
wounds. 
Now disperse, let me beg of you, at once."

     There seemed for a moment a disposition among the mob to give up the
contest, but there were others among them who were infuriated with drink, 
and
so regardless of all consequences.  Those set up a shout of "Down with the 
red
coats; we are Englishmen, and will do what we like."  Some one then threw a
heavy stone, which struck one of the soldiers, and brought blood from his
cheek.  The officer saw it, but he said at once,--

     "Stand firm, now, stand firm.  No anger-- steady."

     "Twenty pounds for the man who threw that stone," said the magistrate. 
-- 
"Twenty pound ten for old Adamson, the magistrate," cried a voice in the
crowd, which, no doubt came from him who had cast the missile.

     Then, at least fifty stones were thrown, some of which hit the
magistrate, and the remainder came rattling upon the helmets of the 
dragoons,
like a hail shower.

     "I warn you, and beg of you to go," said Mr. Adamson; "for the sake of
your wives and families; I beg of you not to pursue this desperate game."

     Loud cries now arose of "Down with the soldiers; down with the vampyre.
He's in Bannerworth Hall.  Smoke him out.  And then one or two links were
hurled among the dismounted dragoons.  All this was put up with patiently; 
and
then again the mob were implored to leave, which being answered by fresh
taunts, the magistrate proceeded to read the riot act, not one word of which
was audible amid the tumult that prevailed.

     "Put out all the lights," cried a voice among the mob.  The order was
obeyed, and the same voice added; "they dare not fire on us.  Come on:" and 
a
rush was made at the garden wall.

     "Make ready-- present," cried the officer.  And then he added, in an
under tone, "above their heads, now-- fire."

     There was a blaze of light for a moment, a stunning noise, a shout of
dismay from the mob, and in another moment all was still.

     "I hope," said Dr. Chillingworth, "that this is, at all events, a
bloodless victory."

     "You may depend upon that," said his companion; "but is not there some
one yet remaining?  Look there, do you not see a figure clambering over the
fence?"

     "Yes, I do, indeed.  Ah, they have him a prisoner, at all events.  
Those
two dragoons have him, fast enough; we shall now, perhaps, hear from this
fellow who is the actual ringleader in such an affair, which, but for the
pusillanimity of the mob, might have turned out to be really most 
disastrous."

     It was strange how one man should think it expedient to attack the
military post after the mob had been so completely routed at the first
discharge of fire-arms, but so it was.  One man did make an attempt to enter
the garden, and it was so rapid and so desperate an one, that he rather
seemed to throw himself bodily at the fence, which separated it from the
meadows without, than to clamber over it, as any one under ordinary
circumstances, who might wish to effect an entrance by that means, would 
have
done.

     He was no sooner, however, perceived, than a couple of the dismounted
soldiers stepped forward and made a prisoner of him.

     "Good God!" exclaimed Mr. Chillingworth, as they approached nearer with
him.  "Good God! what is the meaning of that?  Do my eyes deceive me, or are
they, indeed, so blessed?"

     "Blessed by what?" exclaimed the hangman.

     "By a sight of the long lost, deeply regretted Charles Holland. 
Charles-- Charles, is that indeed you, or some unsubstantial form in your
likeness?"

     Charles Holland, for it was, indeed, himself, heard the friendly voice 
of
the doctor, and he called out to him.

     "Speak to me of Flora.  Oh, speak to me of Flora, if you would not have
me die at once of suspense, and all the torture of apprehension."

     "She lives and is well."

     "Thank Heaven.  Do with me what you please."

     Dr. Chillingworth sprang forward, and addressing the magistrate, he
said,--

     "Sir, I know this gentleman.  He is not one of the rioters, but a dear
friend of the family of the Bannerworths.  Charles Holland, what in the name
of Heaven had become of you so long, and what brought you here at such a
juncture as this?"

     "I am faint," said Charles; "I-- I only arrived as the crowd did.  I 
had
not the strength to fight my way through them, and was compelled to pause
until they had dispersed.  Can-- can you give me water?"

     "Here's something better," said one of the soldiers, as he handed a 
flask
to Charles, who partook of some of the contents, which greatly revived him,
indeed.

     "I am better now," he said.  "Thank you kindly.  Take me into the 
house. 
Good God! why is it made a point of attack?  Where are Flora and Henry?  Are
they all well?  And my uncle?  Oh! what must you all have thought of my
absence!  But you cannot have endured a hundredth part of what I have
suffered.  Let me look once again upon the face of Flora.  Take me into the
house."

     "Release him," said the officer, as he pointed to his head, and looked
significantly, as much to say, "Some mad patient of yours, I suppose."

     "You are much mistaken, sir," said Dr. Chillingworth; "this gentleman 
has
been cruelly used, I have no doubt.  He has, I am inclined to believe, been
made the victim, for a time, of the intrigues of that very Sir Francis 
Varney,
whose conduct has been the real cause of all the serious disturbances that
have taken place in the country."

     "Confound Sir Francis Varney," muttered the officer; "he is enough to 
set
a whole nation by the ears.  However, Mr. Magistrate, if you are satisfied
that this young man is not one of the rioters, I have, of course, no wish to
hold him a prisoner."

     "I can take Mr. Chillingworth's word for more than that," said the
magistrate.

     Charles Holland was accordingly released, and then the doctor, in 
hurried
accents, told him the principal outlines of what had occurred.

     "Oh! take me to Flora," he said; "let me not delay another moment in
seeking her, and convincing her that I could not have been guilty of the
baseness of deserting her."

     "Hark you, Mr. Holland, I have quite made up my mind that I will not
leave Bannerworth Hall yet; but you can go alone, and easily find them by 
the
directions which I will give you; only let me beg of you not to go abruptly
into the presence of Flora.  She is in an extremely delicate state of 
health,
and although I do not take upon myself to say that a shock of a pleasurable
nature would prove of any paramount bad consequence to her, yet it is as 
well
not to risk it."

     "I will be most careful, you may depend."

     At this moment there was a loud ringing at the garden bell, and, when 
it
was answered by one of the dragoons, who was ordered to do so by his 
officer,
he came back, escorting no other than Jack Pringle, who had been sent by the
admiral to the Hall, but who had solaced himself so much on the road with
divers potations, that he did not reach it till now, which was a full hour
after the reasonable time in which he ought to have gone the distance.

     Jack was not to say dumb, but he had had enough to give him a very 
jolly
sort of feeling of independence, and so he came along quarrelling with the
soldier all the way, the latter only laughing and keeping his temper
admiralbly well, under a great deal of provocation.

     "Why, you land lubbers," cried Jack, "what do you do here, all of you, 
I
wonder?  You are all vamphighers, I'll be bound, every one of you.  You mind
me of marines, you do, and that's quite enough to turn a proper seaman's
stomach, any day in the week."

     The soldier only laughed, and brought Jack up to the little group of
persons consisting of Dr. Chillingworth, the hangman, Charles Holland, and 
the
officer.

     "Why, Jack Pringle," said Dr. Chillingworth, stepping before Charles, 
so
that Jack should not see him, -- "why, Jack Pringle, what brings you here?"

     "A slight squall, sir, to the nor west.  Brought you something to eat."

     Jack produced a bottle.

     "To drink, you mean?"

     "Well, it's all one; only in this here shape you see, it goes down
better, I'm thinking, which does make a little difference somehow."

     "How is the admiral?"

     "Oh, he's as stupid as ever; Lord bless you, he'd be like a ship 
without
a rudder without me, and would go swaying about at the mercy of winds and
waves, poor old man.  He's bad enough as it is, but if so be I wasn't to 
give
the eye to him as I does, bless my heart if I thinks as he'd be above 
hatches
long.  Here's to you all."

     Jack took the cork from the bottle he had with him, and there came from
it a stong odour of rum.  Then he placed it to his lips, and was enjoying 
the
pleasant gurgle of the liquor down his throat, when Charles stepped up to 
him,
and laying hold of the lower end of the bottle, he dragged it from his 
mouth,
saying,--

     "How dare you talk in the way you have of my uncle, you drunken, 
mutinous
rascal, and behind his back too!"

     The voice of Charles Holland was as well known to Jack Pringle as that 
of
the admiral, and his intense astonishment at hearing himself so suddenly
addressed by one, of whose proximity he had not the least idea, made some of
the rum go, what is popularly termed, the wrong way, and nearly choked him.

     He reeled back, till he fell over some obstruction, and then down he 
sat
on a flower bed, while his eyes seemed ready to come out of his head.

     "Avast heavings," he cried.  "Who's that?"

     "Come, come," said Charles Holland, "don't pretend you don't know me; I
will not have my uncle spoken of in a disrespectful manner by you."

     "Well, shiver my timbers, if that ain't our nevey.  Why, Charley, my 
boy,
how are you?  Here we are in port at last.  Won't the old commodore pipe his
eye, now.  Whew! here's a go.  I've found our nevey, after all."

     "You found him," said Dr. Chillingworth; "now, that is as great a piece
of impudence as ever I heard in all my life.  You mean that he has found 
you,
and found you out, too, you drunken fellow.  Jack, you get worse and worse
every day."

     "Ay, ay, sir."

     "What, you admit it?"

     "Ay, ay, sir.  Now Master Charley, I tell you what it is, I shall take
you off to your old uncle, you shore-going sneak, and you'll have to report
what cruise you've been upon all this while, leaving the ship to look after
itself.  Lord love you all, if it hadn't been for me I don't know what 
anybody
would have done."

     "I only know of the result," said Dr. Chillingworth, "that would ensue,
if it were not for you, and that would consist in a great injury to the
revenue, in consequence of the much less consumption of rum and other strong
liquors."

     "I'll be hanged up at the yard if I understands what you mean," said
Jack; "as if I ever drunk anything-- I, of all people in the world.  I am
ashamed of you.  You are drunk."

     Several of the dragoons had to turn aside to keep themselves from
laughing, and the officer himself could not forbear from a smile as he said 
to
the doctor,--

     "Sir, you seem to have many acquaintances, and by some means or another
they all have an inclination to come here tonight.  If, however, you 
consider
that you are bound to remain here from a feeling that the Hall is threatened
with any danger, you may dismiss that fear, for I shall leave a picquet here
all night."

     "No, sir," replied Dr. Chillingworth, "it is not that I fear now, after
the manner in which they have been repulsed, any danger to the Hall from the
mob; but I have reasons for wishing to be in it or near it for some time to
come."

     "As you please."

     "Charles, do not wait for or accept the guidance of that drunken 
fellow,
but go yourself with a direction which I will write down for you in a leaf 
of
my pocket-book."

     "Drunken fellow," exclaimed Jack, who had now scrambled to his feet, 
"who
do you call a drunken fellow?"

     "Why you, unquestionably."

     "Well, now, that is hard.  Come along, nevey; I'll shew you where they
all are.  I could walk a plank on any deck with any man in the service, I
could.  Come along, my boy, come along."

     "You can accept of him as a guide if you like, of course," said the
doctor; "he may be sober enough to conduct you."

     "I think he can," said Charles.  "Lead on, Jack; but mark me, I shall
inform my uncle of this intemperance, as well as of the manner in which you
let your tongue wag about him behind his back, unless you promise to 
reform."

     "He is long past all reformation," remarked Dr. Chillingworth; "it is 
out
of the question."

     "And I am afraid my uncle will not have courage to attempt such an
ungrateful task, when there is so little chance of success."  replied 
Charles
Holland, shaking the worthy doctor by the hand.  "Farewell, for the present,
sir; the next time I see you, I hope we shall both be more pleasantly
situated."

     "Come along, nevey," interrupted Jack Pringle; "now you've found your 
way
back, the first thing you ought to do, is to report yourself as having come
aboard.  Follow me, and I'll soon show yer the port where the old hulk's 
laid
hisself up."

     Jack walked on first, tolerably steady, if one may take into account 
his
divers deep potations, and Charles Holland, anticipating with delight again
looking upon the face of his much loved Flora, followed closely behind him.

     We can well imagine the world of delightful thoughts that came crowding
upon him when Jack, after a rather long walk, announced that they were now
very near the residence of the object of his soul's adoration.

     We trust that there is not one of our readers who, for one moment, will
suppose that Charles Holland was the sort of man to leave even such a 
villain
and double-faced hypocrite as Marchdale, to starve amid the gloomy ruins 
where
he was immured.

     Far from Charles's intentions was any such thing; but he did think that 
a
night passed there, with no other company than his own reflections, would do
him a world of good, and was, at all events, no very great modicum of
punishment for the rascality with which he had behaved.

     Besides, even during that night there were refreshments in the shape of
bread and water, such as had been presented to Charles himself, within
Marchdale's reach as they had been within his.

     That individual now, Charles thought, would have a good opportunity of
testing the quality of that kind of food, and of finding out what an 
extremely
light diet it was for a strong man to live upon.

     But in the morning it was Charles's intention to take Henry Bannerworth
and the admiral with him to the ruins, and then and there release the wretch
from his confinement, on condition that he made a full confession of his
villanies before those persons.

     Oh, how gladly would Marchdale have exchanged the fate which actually
befell him for any amount of personal humiliation, always provided that it
brought with it a commensurate amount of personal safety.

     But that fate was one altogether undreamt of by Charles Holland, and
wholly without his control.

     It was a fate which would have been his, but for the murderous purpose
which had brought Marchdale to the dungeon, and those happy accidents which
had enabled Charles to change places with him, and breathe the free, cool,
fresh air; while he left his enemy loaded with the same chains that had
encumbered his limbs so cruelly, and lying on that same damp dungeon floor,
which he thought would be his grave.

     We mentioned that as Charles left the ruins, the storm, which had been
giving various indications of its coming, seemed to be rapidly approaching.

     It was one of these extremely local tempests which expend all their
principal fury over a small space of country; and, in this instance, the
space seemed to include little more than the river, and the few meadows 
which
immediately surrounded it, and lent it so much of its beauty.

     Marchdale soon found that his cries were drowned by the louder voices 
of
the elements.  The wailing of the wind among the ancient ruins was much more
full of sound than his cries; and, now and then, the full-mouthed thunder
filled the air with such a volume of roaring, and awakened so many echoes
among the ruins, that, had he possessed the voices of fifty men, he could 
not
have hoped to wage war with it.

     And then, although we know that Charles Holland would have encountered
death himself, rather than he would have willingly left anything human to
expire of hunger in that dungeon, yet Marchdale, judging of others by 
himself,
felt by no means sure of any such thing, and, in his horror of apprehension,
fancied that that was just the sort of easy, and pleasant, and complete
revenge that it was in Charles Holland's power to take, and just the one 
which
would suggest itself, under the circumstances, to his mind.

     Could anything be possibly more full of horror than such a thought? 
Death, let it come in any shape it may, is yet a most repulsive and 
unwelcome
guest; but, when it comes, so united with all that can add to its terrors, 
it
is enough to drive reason from its throne, and fill the mind with images of
absolute horror.

     Tired of shrieking, for his parched lips and clogged tongue would 
scarely
now permit him to utter a sound higher than a whisper, Marchdale lay,
listening to the furious storm without, in the last abandonment of despair.

     "Oh! what a death is this," he groaned.  "Here, alone-- all alone-- and
starvation to creep on me by degrees, sapping life's energies one by one. 
Already do I feel the dreadful sickening weakness growing on me.  Help, oh!
help me Heav---- no, no!  Dare I call on Heaven to help me?  Is there no 
fiend
of darkness who now will bid me a price for a human soul?  Is there not one
who will do so-- not one who will rescue me from the horror that surrounds 
me,
for Heaven will not?  I dare not ask mercy there."

     The storm continued louder and louder.  The wind, it is true, was 
nearly
hushed, but the roar and the rattle of the echo-awakening thunder fully made
up for its cessation, while, now and then, even there, in that underground
abode, some sudden reflection of the vivid lightning's light would find its
way, lending, for a fleeting moment, sufficient light to Marchdale, 
wherewith
he could see the gloomy place in which he was.

     At times he wept, and at times he raved, while ever and anon he made 
such
frantic efforts to free himself from the chains that were around him, that,
had they not been strong, he must have succeeded; but, as it was, he only 
made
deep indentations into his flesh, and gave himself much pain.

     "Charles Holland!" he shouted; "oh! release me!  Varney! Varney! why do
you not come to save me?  I have toiled for you most unrequitedly-- I have 
not
had my reward.  Let it all consist in my release from this dreadful bondage. 
Help! help! oh, help!"

     There was no one to hear him.  The storm continued, and now, suddenly, 
a
sudden and a sharper sound than any awakened by the thunder's roar came upon
his startled ear, and, in increased agony, he shouted,--

     "What is that? oh! what is that?  God of heaven, do my fears translate
that sound aright?  Can it be, oh! can it be, that the ruins which have 
stood
for so many a year are now crumbling down before the storm of to-night?"

     The sound came again, and he felt the walls of the dungeon in which he
was shake.  Now there could be no doubt but that the lightning had struck 
some
part of the building, and so endangered the safety of all that was above
ground.  For a moment there came across his brain such a rush of agony, that
he neither spoke nor moved.  Had that dreadful feeling continued much 
longer,
he must have lapsed into insanity; but that amount of mercy-- for mercy it
would have been-- was not shown to him.  He still felt all the accumulating
horrors of his situation, and then, with such shrieks as nothing but a full
appreciation of such horrors could have given him strength to utter, he 
called
upon earth, upon heaven, and upon all that was infernal, to save him from 
his
impending doom.

     All was in vain.  It was an impending doom which nothing but the direct
interposition of Heaven could have at all averted; and it was not likely 
that
any such perversion of the regular laws of nature would take place to save
such a man as Marchdale.

     Again came the crashing sound of falling stones, and he was certain 
that
the old ruins, which had stood for so many hundred years the storm, and the
utmost wrath of the elements, was at length yielding, and crumbling down.

     What else could he expect but to be engulphed among the fragments --
fragments still weighty and destructive, although in decay.  How fearfully 
now
did his horrified imagination take in at one glance, as it were, a panoramic
view of all his past life, and how absolutely contemptible, at that moment,
appeared all that he had been striving for.

     But the walls shake again, and this time the vibration is more fearful
than before.  There is a tremendous uproar above him -- the roof yields to
some superincumbent pressure -- there is one shriek, and Marchdale lies
crushed beneath a mass of masonry that it would take men and machinery days 
to
remove from off him.

     All is over now.  That bold, bad man -- that accomplished hypocrite -- 
that mendacious, would-be murderer was no more.  He lies but a mangled,
crushed, and festering corpse.

     May his soul find mercy with his God!

     The storm, from this moment, seemed to relax in its violence, as if it
had accomplished a great purpose, and, consequently, now, need no longer 
"vex
the air with its boisterous presence."  Gradually the thunder died away in 
the
distance.  The wind no longer blew in blustrous gusts, but, with a gentle
murmuring, swept around the ancient pile, as if singing the requiem of the
dead that lay beneath -- that dead which mortal eyes were never to look 
upon.

 Next Week: The Meeting of Charles and Flora.




                               Chapter LXXIV.

THE MEETING OF CHARLES AND FLORA.


     Charles Holland followed Jack Pringle for some time in silence from
Bannerworth Hall; his mind was too full of thought concerning the past to
allow him to indulge in much of that kind of conversation in which Jack
Pringle might be fully considered to be a proficient.

     As for Jack, somehow or another, he had felt his dignity offended in 
the
garden of Bannerworth Hall, and he had made up his mind, as he afterwards
stated in his own phraseology, not to speak to nobody till somebody spoke to
him.

     A growing anxiety, however, to ascertain from one who had seen her 
lately,
how Flora had borne his absence, at length induced Charles Holland to break
his self-imposed silence.

     "Jack," he said, "you have had the happiness of seeing her lately, tell
me, does Flora Bannerworth look as she was wont to look, or have all the 
roses
faded from her cheeks?"

     "Why, as for the roses," said Jack, "I'm blowed if I can tell, and 
seeing
as how she don't look at me much, I doesn't know nothing about her; I can 
tell
you something, though, about the old admiral that will make you open your
eyes."

     "Indeed, Jack, and what may that be?"

     "Why, he's took to drink, and gets groggy about every day of his life,
and the most singular thing is, that when that's the case with the old man, 
he
says it's me."

     "Indeed, Jack! taken to drinking has my poor old uncle, from grief, I
suppose, Jack at my disappearance."

     "No, I don't think it's grief," said Jack; "it strikes me it's
rum-and-water."

     "Alas, alas, I never could have imagined he could have fallen into that
habit of yours; he always seemed so far from anything of this kind."

     "Ay, ay, sir," said Jack, "I know'd you'd be astonished.  It will be 
the
death of him, that's my opinion; and the idea, you know, Master Charles, of
accusing me when he gets drunk himself."

     "I believe that is a common delusion of intemperate persons," said
Charles.

     "Is it, sir; well, it's a very awkward thing, because you know, sir, as
well as most people, that I'm not the fellow to take a drop too much."

     "I cannot say, Jack, that I know so much, for I have certainly heard my
uncle accuse you of intoxication."

     "Lor', sir, that was all just on account of his trying it hisself; he 
was
a thinking on it then, and wanted to see how I'd take it."

     "But tell me of Flora; are you quite certain that she has had no more
alarms from Varney?"

     "What, that ere vampyre fellow? not a bit of it, your honour.  Lor' 
bless
you, he must have found out by some means or another that I was on the look
out, and that did the business.  He'll never come near Miss Flora again, 
I'll
be bound, though to be sure we moved away from the Hall on account of him; 
but
not that I saw the good of cruising out of one's own latitude, but somehow 
or
another you see the doctor and the admiral got it into their heads to
establish a sort of blockade, and the idea of the thing was to sail away in
the night quite quiet, and after that take up a position that would come
across the enemy on the larboard tack, if so be as he made his appearance."

     "Oh, you allude to watching the Hall, I presume?"

     "Ay, ay, sir, just so; but would you believe it, Master Charlie, the
admiral and the doctor got so blessed drunk that I could do nothing with 
'em."

     "Indeed!"

     "Yes, they did indeed, and made all kinds of queer mistakes, so that 
the 
end of all that was, that the vampyre did come; but he got away again."

     "He did come then; Sir Francis Varney came again after the house was
presumed to be deserted?"

     "He did, sir."

     "That is very strange; what on earth could have been his object?  This
affair is most inexplicably mysterious.  I hope the distance, Jack, is not 
far
that you're taking me, for I'm incapable of enduring much fatigue."

     "Not a great way, your honour; keep two points to the westward, and 
sail
straight on; we'll soon come to port.  My eye, won't there be a squall when
you get in.  I expect as Miss Flora will drop down as dead as a herring, for
she doesn't think you're above the hatches."

     "A good thought, Jack; my sudden appearance may produce alarm.  When we
reach the place of abode of the Bannerworths, you shall precede me, and
prepare them in some measure for my reception."

     "Very good, sir; do you see that there little white cottage a-head, 
there
in the offing?"

     "Yes, yes; is that the place?"

     "Yes, your honour, that's the port to which we are bound."

     "Well, then, Jack, you hasten a-head, and see Miss Flora, and be sure 
you
prepare her gently and by degrees, you know, Jack, for my appearance, so 
that
she shall not be alarmed."

     "Ay, ay, sir, I understand; you wait here, and I'll go and do it; there
would be a squall if you were to make your appearance, sir, all at once.  
She
looks upon you as safely lodged in Davy's locker; she minds me, all the 
world,
of a girl I knew at Portsmouth, called Bet Bumplush.  She was one of your
delicate little creatures as don't live long in this here world; no, blow 
me;
when I came home from a eighteen months' cruise, once I seed her drinking 
rum
out of a quart pot, so I says, 'Hilloa, what cheer?'  And only to think now 
of
the wonderful effect that there had upon her; with that very pot she gives 
the
fellow as was standing treat a knobber on the head as lasted him three 
weeks. 
She was too good for this here world, she was, and too rummantic.  'Go to
blazes,' she says to him, 'here's Jack Pringle come home.'"

     "Very romantic indeed," said Charles.

     "Yes, I believe you, sir; and that puts me in mind of Miss Flora and
you."

     "An extremely flattering comparison.  Of course I feel much obliged."

     "Oh, don't name it, sir.  The British tar as can't oblige a feller-
cretor
is unworthy to tread the quarter-deck, or to bear a hand to the distress of 
a
woman."

     "Very well," said Charles.  "Now, as we are here, precede me, if you
please, and let me beg of you to be especially cautious in your manner of
announcing me."

     "Ay, ay, sir," said Jack; and away he walked towards the cottage, 
leaving
Charles some distance behind.

     Flora and the admiral were sitting together conversing.  The old man, 
who
loved her as if she had been a child of his own, was endeavouring, to the
extent of his ability, to assuage the anguish of her thoughts, which at that
moment chanced to be bent upon Charles Holland.

     "Never mind, my dear," he said; "he'll turn up some of these days, and
when he does, I sha'n't forget to tell him that it was you who stood out for
his honesty and truth, when every one else was against him, including 
myself,
an old wretch that I was."

     "Oh, sir, how could you for one moment believe that those letters could
have been written by your nephew Charles?  They carried, sir, upon the face 
of
them their own refutation; and I'm only surprised that for one instant you, 
or
any one who knew him, could have believed him capable of writing them."

     "Avast, there," said the admiral; "that'll do.  I own you got the 
better
of the old sailor there.  I think you and Jack Pringle were the only two
persons who stood out from the first."

     "Then I honour Jack for doing so."

     "And here he is," said the admiral, "and you'd better tell him.  The
mutinous rascal! he wants all the honour he can get, as a set-off against 
his
drunkenness and other bad habits."

     Jack walked into the room, looked about him in silence for a moment,
thrust his hands in his breeches pockets, and gave a long whistle.

     "What's the matter now?" said the admiral.

     "D--me, if Charles Holland ain't outside, and I've come to prepare you
for the blessed shock," said Jack.  "Don't faint either of you, because I'm
only going to let you know it by degrees, you know."

     A shriek burst from Flora's lips, and she sprung to the door of the
apartment.

     "What!" cried the admiral, "my nephew-- my nephew Charles!  Jack, you
rascal, if you're joking, it's the last joke you shall make in this world; 
and
if it's true, I-- I-- I'm an old fool, that's all."

     "Ay, ay, sir," said Jack; "didn't you know that afore?"

     "Charles-- Charles!" cried Flora.  He heard the voice.  Her name 
escaped
his lips, and rang with a pleasant echo through the house.

     In another moment he was in the room, and had clasped her to his 
breast.

     "My own-- my beautiful-- my true!"

     "Charles, dear Charles!"

     "Oh, Flora, what have I not endured since last we met; but this repays
me-- more than repays me for all."

     "What is the past now," cried Flora-- "what are all its miseries placed
against this happy, happy moment?"

     "D--me, nobody thinks of me," said the admiral.

     "My dear uncle," said Charles, looking over Flora's shoulder, as he 
still
held her in his arms, "is that you?"

     "Yes, yes, swab, it is me, and you know it; but give us your five, you
mutinous vagabond; and I tell you what, I'll do you the greatest favour I've
had an opportunity of doing you some time-- I'll leave you alone, you dog. 
Come along, Jack."

     "Ay, ay, sir," said Jack; and away they went out of the apartment.

     And now those two loving hearts were alone-- they who had been so long
separated by malignant destiny, once again were heart to heart, looking into
each other's faces with all the beaming tenderness of an affection of the
truest, holiest character.

     The admiral had done a favour to them both to leave them alone, 
although
we much doubt whether his presence or the presence of the whole world would
have had the effect of controlling one generous sentiment of noble feeling.

     They would have forgotten everything but that they were together, and
that once again each looked into the other's eyes with all the tenderness of 
a
love purer and higher than ordinarily belongs to mortal affections.

     Language was weak to give utterance to the full gust of happy feelings
that now were theirs.  It was ecstacy enough to feel, to know that the evil
fortune which had so long separted them, depriving each existence of its
sunniest aspect, was over.  It was enough for Charles Holland to feel that 
she
loved him still.  It was enough for Flora Bannerworth to know, as she looked
into his beaming countenance, that that love was not misplaced, but was met 
by
feelings such as she herself would have dictated to be the inhabitants of 
the
of the heart of him whom she would have chosen from the mass of mankind as 
her
own.

     "Flora-- dear Flora," said Charles, "and you have never doubted me?"

     "I've never doubted, Charles, Heaven or you.  To doubt one would have
been to doubt both."

     "Generous and best of girls, what must you have thought of my enforced
absence!  Oh! Flora, I was unjust enough to your truth to make my greatest
pang the thought that you might doubt me, and cast me from your heart for
ever."

     "Ah! Charles, you ought to have known me better.  I stood amid sore
temptation to do so much.  There were those who would have urged me on to
think that you had cast me from your heart for ever.  There were those ready
and willing to place the worst construction upon your conduct, and with a
devilish ingenuity to strive to make me participate in such a feeling; but,
no, Charles, no-- I loved you, and I trusted you, and I could not so far 
belie
my own judgment as to tell you other than what you always seemed to my young
fancy."

     "And you are right, my Flora, right; and is it not a glorious triumph 
to
see that love-- that sentiment of passion-- has enabled you to have so
enduring and so noble a confidence in aught human?"

     "Ay, Charles, it is the sentiment of passion, for our love has been 
more
a sentiment than a passion.  I would fain think that we had loved each other
with an affection not usually known, appreciated, or understood, and so, in
the vanity of my best affections, I would strive to think them something
exclusive, and beyond the common feelings of humanity."

     "And you are right, my Flora; such love as yours is the exception; 
there
may be preferences, there may be passions, and there may be sentiments, but
never, never, surely was there a heart like yours."

     "Nay, Charles, now you speak from a too poetical fancy; but is it
possible that I have had you here so long, with your hand clasped in mine, 
and
asked you not the causes of your absence?"

     "Oh, Flora, I have suffered much-- much physically, but more mentally. 
It was the thought of you that was at once the bane and the antidote of my
existence."

     "Indeed, Charles!  Did I present myself in such contradictory colours 
to
you?"

     "Yes, dearest, as thus.  When I thought of you, sometimes, in the deep
seclusion of a dungeon, that thought almost goaded me to madness, because it
brought with it the conviction-- a conviction peculiar to a lover-- that 
none
could so effectually stand between you and all evil as myself."

     "Yes, yes, Charles; most true."

     "It seemed to me as if all the world in arms could not have protected 
you
so well as this one heart, clad in the triple steel of its affections, could
have shielded you from evil."

     "Ay, Charles; and then I was the bane of your existence, because I 
filled
you with apprehension?"

     "For a time, dearest; and then came the antidote; for when exhausted
alike in mind and body-- when lying helpless, with chains upon my limbs-- 
when
expecting death at every visit of those who had dragged me from light and 
from
liberty, and from love; it was but the thought of thy beauty and thy 
affection
that nerved me, and gave me a hope even amidst the cruellest disasters."

     "And then-- and then, Charles?"

     "You were my blessing, as you have ever been-- as you are, and as you
will ever be-- my own Flora, my beautiful-- my true!"

     We won't go so far as to say it is the fact; but, from a series of
singular sounds which reached even to the passage of the cottage, we have 
our
own private opinion to the effect that Charles began kissing Flora at the 
top
of her forehead, and never stopped, somehow or another, till he got down to

 Next Time: Mutual Explanations, and the Visit to the Ruins.




                                Chapter LXXV.

MUTUAL EXPLANATIONS, AND THE VISIT TO THE RUINS.


     During the next hour, Charles informed Flora of the whole particulars 
of
his forcible abduction; and to his surprise he heard, of course, for the 
first
time, of those letters, purporting to be written by him, which endeavoured 
to
give so bad an aspect to the fact of his sudden disappearance from 
Bannerworth
Hall.

     Flora would insist upon the admiral, Henry, and the rest of the family,
hearing all that Charles had to relate concerning Mr. Marchdale; for well 
she
knew that her mother, from early associations, was so far impressed in the
favour of that hypocritical personage, that nothing but damning facts, much 
to
his prejudice, would suffice to convince her of the character he really was.

     But she was open to conviction, and when she really found what a 
villain
she had cherished and given her confidence to, she shed abundance of tears,
and blamed herself exceedingly as the cause of some of the misfortunes which
had fallen upon her children.

     "Very good," said the admiral; "I ain't surprised a bit.  I knew he was 
a
vagabond from the first time I clapped eyes upon him.  There was a down look
about the fellow's figure-head that I didn't like, and be hanged to him, but 
I
never thought he would have gone the length he has done.  And so you say
you've got him safe in the ruins, Charles?"

     "I have, indeed, uncle."

     "And then there let him remain, and a good place, too, for him."

     "No, uncle, no.  I'm sure you speak without thought.  I intend to 
release
him in a few hours, when I have rested from my fatigues.  He could not come 
to
any harm if he were to go without food entirely for the time that I leave 
him;
but even that he will not do, for there is bread and water in the dungeon."

     "Bread and water! that's too good for him.  But, however, Charles, when
you go to let him out, I'll go with you, just to tell him what I think of 
him,
the vagabond."

     "He must suffer amazingly, for no doubt knowing well, as he does, his 
own
infamous intentions, he will consider that if I were to leave him to starve 
to
death, I should be but retailing upon him the injuries he would have 
inflicted
upon me."

     "The worst of it is," said the admiral, "I can't think what to do with
him."

     "Do nothing, uncle, but just let him go; it will be a sufficient
punishment for such a man to feel that, instead of succeeding in his 
designs,
he has only brought upon himself the bitterest contempt of those whom he 
would
fain have injured.  I can have no desire for revenge on such a man as
Marchdale."

     "You are right, Charles," said Flora; "let him go, and let him go with 
a
feeling that he has acquired the contempt of those whose best opinions might
have been his for a far less amount of trouble than he has taken to acquire
their worst."

     Excitement had kept up Charles to this point, but now, when he arose 
and
expressed his intention of going to the ruins, for the purpose of releasing
Marchdale, he exhibited such unequivocal symptoms of exhaustion and fatigue
that neither his uncle nor Flora would permit him to go, so, in deference to
them, he gave up the point, and commissioned the admiral and Jack, with 
Henry,
to proceed to the place, and give the villain his freedom; little suspecting
what had occurred since he had himself left the neighbourhood of those 
ruins.

     Of course Charles Holland couldn't be at all accountable for the work 
of
the elements, and it was not for him to imagine that when he left Marchdale 
in
the dungeon that so awful a catastrophe as that we have recorded to the 
reader
was to ensue.

     The distance to the ruins was not so great from this cottage even as it
was from Bannerworth Hall, provided those who went knew the most direct and
best road to take; so that the admiral was not gone above a couple of hours,
and when he returned he sat down and looked at Charles with such a peculiar
expression, that the latter could not for the life of him tell what to make 
of
it.

     "Something has happened, uncle," he said, "I am certain; tell me at 
once
what it is."

     "Oh! nothing, nothing," said the admiral, "of any importance."

     "Is that what you call your feelings?" said Jack Pringle.  "Can't you
tell him as there came on a squall last night, and the ruins have come in 
with
a dab upon old Marchdale, crushing his guts, so that we smelt him as soon as
we got nigh at hand?"

     "Good God!" said Charles, "has such a catastrophe occurred?"

     "Yes, Charles, that's just about the catastrophe that has occurred.  
He's
dead; and rum enough it is that it should happen on the very night that you
escaped."

     "Rum!" said Jack, suddenly; "my eye, who mentions rum?  What a singular
sort of liquour rum must be.  I heard of a chap as used to be fond of it 
once
on board a ship; I wonder if there's any in the house."

     "No!" said the admiral; "but there's a fine pump of spring water 
outside
if you feel a little thirsty, Jack; and I'll engage it shall do you more 
good
than all the rum in the world."

     "Uncle," said Charles, "I'm glad to hear you make that observation."

     "What for?"

     "Why, to deal candidly with you, uncle, Jack informed me that you had
lately taken quite a predilection for drinking."

     "Me!" cried the admiral; "why the infernal rascal, I've had to threaten
him with his discharge a dozen times, at least, on that very ground, and no
other."

     "There's somebody calling me," said Jack.  "I'm a coming!  I'm a 
coming!"
and so he bolted out of the room, just in time to escape an inkstand, which
the admiral caught up and flung after him.

     "I'll strike that rascal off the ship's books this very day," muttered
Admiral Bell.  "The drunken vagabond, to pretend that I take anything, when
all the while it's himself!"

     "Well, well, I ought certainly to have suspected the quarter from 
whence
the intelligence came; but he told it to me so circumstantially, and with 
such
an apparent feeling of regret for the weakness into which he said you had
fallen, that I really thought there might be some truth in it."

     "The rascal!  I've done with him from this moment; I have put up with 
too
much from him for years past."

     "I think now that you have given him a great deal of liberty, and that,
with a great deal more he has taken, makes up an amount which you find it
difficult to endure."

     "And I won't endure it."

     "Let me talk to him, and I dare say I shall be able to convince him 
that
he goes too far, and when he finds that such is the case he will mend."

     "Speak to him, if you like, but I have done with such a mutinous 
rascal,
I have.  You can take him into your service, if you like, till you get tired
of him; and that won't be very long."

     "Well, well we shall see.  Jack will apologise to you I have no doubt;
and then I shall intercede for him, and advise you to give him another 
trial."

     "If you get him into the apology, then there's no doubt about me giving
him another trial.  But I know him too well for that; he's as obstinate as a
mule, he is, and you won't get a civil word out of him; but never mind that,
now.  I tell you what, Master Charley, it will take a good lot of roast beef
to get up your good looks again."

     "It will, indeed, uncle; and I require, now, rest, for I am thoroughly
exhausted.  The great privations I have undergone, and the amount of mental
excitement which I have experienced, in consequence of the sudden and
unexpected release from a fearful confinement, have greatly weakened all my
energies.  A few hours' sleep will make quite a different being of me."

     "Well, my boy, you know best," returned the admiral; "and I'll take 
care,
if you sleep till to-morrow, that you sha'n't be disturbed.  So now be off 
to
bed at once."

     The young man shook his uncle's hand in a cordial manner, and then
repaired to the apartment which had been provided for him.

     Charles Holland did, indeed, stand in need of repose; and for the first
time now for many days he laid down with serenity at his heart, and slept 
for
many hours.  And was there not now a great and a happy change in Flora
Bannerworth!  As if by magic, in a few short hours, much of the bloom of her
before-fading beauty returned to her.  Her step again recovered its springy
lightness; again she smiled upon her mother, and suffered herself to talk of 
a
happy future; for the dread even of the vampyre's visitations had faded into
comparative insignificance against the heart's deep dejection which had come
over her at the thought that Charles Holland must surely be murdered, or he
would have contrived to come to her.

     And what a glorious recompense she had now for the trusting confidence
with which she had clung to a conviction of his truth!  Was it not great, 
now,
to feel that when he was condemned by others, and when strong and
unimpeachable evidence seemed to be against him, she had clung to him and
declared her faith in his honour, and wept for him instead of condemning?

     Yes, Flora; you were of that order of noble minds that, where once
confidence is given, give it fully and completely, and will not harbour a 
suspicion of the faith of the loved one, a happy disposition when verified, 
as
in this instance, by an answering truthfulness.

     But when such a heart trusts not with judgment-- when that pure, 
exalted,
and noble confidence is given to an object unworthy of it-- then comes,
indeed, the most fearful of all mental struggles; and if the fond heart, 
that
has hugged to its inmost core so worthless a treasure, do not break in the
effort to discard it, we may well be surprised at the amount of fortitude 
that
has endured so much.

     Although the admiral had said but little concerning the fearful end
Marchdale had come to, it really did make some impression upon him; and, 
much
as he held in abhorrence the villany of Marchdale's conduct, he would gladly
in his heart have averted the fate from him that he had brought upon 
himself.

     On the road to the ruins, he calculated upon taking a different kind of
vengeance.

     When they had got some distance from the cottage, Admiral Bell made a
proposal to Henry to be his second while he fought Marchdale, but Henry 
would
not hear of it for a moment.

     "My dear sir," he said, "could I, do you think, stand by and see a
valuable, a revered, and a respected life like yours exposed to any hazard
merely upon the chance of punishing a villain?  No, no; Marchdale is too 
base
now to be met in honourable encounter.  If he is dealt with in any way let 
it
be by the laws."

     This was reasonable enough, and after some argument the admiral 
coincided
in it, and then they began to wonder how, without Charles, they should be 
able
to get an entrance to the dungeons, for it had been his intention 
originally,
had he not felt so fatigued, to go with them.

     As soon, however, as they got tolerably near to the ruins, they saw 
what
had happened.  Neither spoke, but they quickened their pace, and soon stood
close to the mass of stone-work which now had assumed so different a shape 
to
what it had a few short hours before.

     It needed little examination to let them feel certain that whoever 
might
have been in any of the underground dungeons must have be crushed to death.

     "Heaven have mercy upon his soul!" said Henry.

     "Amen!" said the admiral.

     They both turned away, and for some time they neither of them spoke, 
for
their thoughts were full of reflection upon the horrible death which 
Marchdale
must have endured.  At length the admiral said--

     "Shall we tell this or not?"

     "Tell it at once," said Henry; "let us have no secrets."

     "Good.  Then I will not make one you may depend.  I only wish that 
while
he was about it, Charley could have popped that rascal Varney as well in the
dungeon, and then there would have been an end and a good riddance of them
both."

 Next Time: The Second Night-watch of Mr. Chillingworth at the Hall.




                               Chapter LXXVI.

THE SECOND NIGHT-WATCH OF MR. CHILLINGWORTH AT THE HALL.


     The military party in the morning left Bannerworth Hall, and the old
place resumed its wonted quiet.  But Dr. Chillingworth found it difficult to
get rid of his old friend, the hangman, who seemed quite disposed to share 
his
watch with him.

     The doctor, without being at all accused of being a prejudiced man, 
might
well object to the continued companionship of one, who, according to his own
account, was decidedly no better than he should be, if he were half so good.

     Moreover, it materially interfered with the proceedings of our medical
friend, whose object was to watch the vampyre with all imaginable quietness
and secrecy, in the event of his again visiting Bannerworth Hall.

     "Sir," he said, to the hangman, "now that you have so obligingly 
related
to me you melancholy history, I will not detain you."

     "Oh, you are not detaining me."

     "Yes, but I shall probably remain here for a considerable time."

     "I have nothing to do; and one place is about the same as another to 
me."

     "Well, then, if I must speak plainly, allow me to say, that as I came
here upon a very important and special errand, I desire most particularly to
be left alone.  Do you understand me now?"

     "Oh! ah! -- I understand; you want me to go?"

     "Just so."

     "Well, then, Dr. Chillingworth, allow me to tell you, I have come here 
on
a very special errand likewise."

     "You have?"

     "I have.  I have been putting one circumstance to another, and drawing 
a
variety of conclusions from a variety of facts, so that I have come to what 
I
consider an important resolve, namely, to have a good look at Bannerworth
Hall, and if I continue to like it as well as I do now, I should like to 
make
the Bannerworth family an offer for the purchase of it."

     "The devil you would!  Why all the world seems mad upon the project of
buying this old building, which really is getting into such a state of
dilapidation, that it cannot last many years longer."

     "It is my fancy."

     "No, no; there is something more in this than meets the eye.  The same
reason, be it what may, that has induced Varney the vampyre to become so
desirous of possessing the Hall, actuates you."

     "Possibly."

     "And what is that reason?  You may as well be candid with me."

     "Yes, I will, and am.  I like the picturesque aspect of the place."

     "No, you know that that is a disingenuous answer, that you know well.  
It
is not the aspect of the old Hall that has charms for you.  But I feel, only
from your conduct, more than ever convinced, that some plot is going on,
having the accomplishment of some great object as its climax, a something of
which you have guessed."

     "How much you are mistaken!"

     "No, I am certain I am right; and I shall immediately advise the
Bannerworth family to return, and to take up their abode again here, in 
order
to put an end to the hopes which you, or Varney, or any one else may have, 
of
getting possession of the place."

     "If you were a man," said the hangman, "who cared a little more for
yourself, and a little less for others, I would make a confidant of you."

     "What do you mean?"

     "Why, I mean, candidly, that you are not selfish enough to be entitled 
to
my confidence."

     "That is a strange reason for withholding confidence from any man."

     "It is a strange reason; but, in this case, a most abundantly true one. 
I cannot tell you what I would tell you, because I cannot make the agreement
with you that I would fain make."

     "You talk in riddles."

     "To explain which, then, would be to tell my secret."

     Dr. Chillingworth was, evidently, much annoyed, and yet he was in an
extremely helpless condition; for as to forcing the hangman to leave the 
Hall,
if he did not feel disposed to do so, that was completely out of the 
question,
and could not be done.  In the first place, he was a much more powerful man
than the doctor, and in the second, it was quite contrary to all Mr.
Chillingworth's habits, to engage in anything like personal warfare.

     He could only, therefore, look his vexation, and say, --

     "If you are determined upon remaining, I cannot help it; but, when some
one, as there assuredly will, comes from the Bannerworths, here, to me, or I
shall be under the necessity of stating candidly that you are intruding."

     "Very good.  As the morning air is keen, and as we now are not likely 
to
be as good company to each other as we were, I shall go inside the house."

     This was a proposition which the doctor did not like, but he was
compelled to submit to it; and he saw, with feelings of uneasiness, the
hangman make his way into the Hall by one of the windows.

     Then Dr. Chillingworth sat down to think.  Much he wondered what could 
be
the secret of the great desire which Varney, Marchdale, and even this man 
had,
all of them to be possessors of the old Hall.

     That there was some powerful incentive he felt convinced, and he longed
for some conversation with the Bannerworths, or with Admiral Bell, in order
that he might state what had now taken place.  That some one would soon come
to him, in order to bring fresh provisions for the day, he was certain, and
all he could do, in the interim, was, to listen to what the hangman was 
about
in the Hall.

     Not a sound, for a considerable time, disturbed the intense stillness 
of
the place; but, now, suddenly, Mr. Chillingworth thought he heard a 
hammering,
as if some one was at work in one of the rooms of the Hall.

     "What can be the meaning of that?" he said, and he was about to proceed
at once to the interior of the building, through the same window which had
enabled the hangman to gain admittance, when he heard his own name 
pronounced
by some one at the back of the garden fence, and upon casting his eyes in 
that
direction, he, to his great relief, saw the admiral and Henry Bannerworth.

     "Come round to the gate," said the doctor.  "I am more glad to see you
than I can tell you just now.  Do not make more noise than you can help; 
but,
come round to the gate at once."

     They obeyed the injunction with alacrity, and when the doctor had
admitted them, the admiral said, eagerly, --

     "You don't mean to tell us that he is here?"

     "No, no, not Varney; but he is not the only one who has taken a great
affection for Bannerworth Hall; you may have another tenant for it, and I
believe at any price you like to name."

     "Indeed!"

     "Hush! creep along close to the house, and then you will not be seen. 
There! do you hear that noise in the hall?"

     "Why it sounds," said the admiral, "like the ship's carpenter at work."

     "It does, indeed, sound like a carpenter; it's only the new tenant
making, I dare say, some repairs."

     "D--n his impudence!"

     "Why, it certainly does look like a very cool proceeding, I must 
admit."

     "Who, and what is he?"

     "Who he is now, I cannot tell you, but he was once the hangman of 
London,
at a time when I was practising in the metropolis, and so I became 
acquainted
with him.  He knows Sir Francis Varney, and, if I mistake not, has found out
the cause of that mysterious personage's great attachment to Bannerworth 
Hall,
and has found the reasons so cogent, that he has got up an affection for it
himself."

     "To me," said Henry, "all this is as incomprehensible as anything can
possibly be.  What on earth does it all mean?"

     "My dear Henry," said the doctor, "will you be ruled by me?"

     "I will be ruled by any one whom I know I can trust; for I am like a 
man
groping his way in the dark."

     "Then allow this gentleman who is carpentering away so pleasantly 
within
the house, to do so to his heart's content, but don't let him leave it.  
Show
yourselves now in the garden, he has sufficient prudence to know that three
constitute rather fearful odds against one, and so he will be careful, and
remain where he is.  If he should come out, we need not let him go until we
thoroughly ascertain what he has been about."

     "You shall command the squadron, doctor," said the admiral, "and have 
it
all your own way, you know, so here goes!  Come along, Henry, and let's show
ourselves; we are both armed too!"

     They walked out into the centre of the garden, and they were soon
convinced that the hangman saw them, for a face appeared at the window, and
was as quickly withdrawn again.

     "There," said the doctor, "now he knows he is a prisoner, and we may as
well place ourselves in some position which commands a good view of the 
house,
as well as of the garden gate, and so see if we cannot starve him out, 
though
we may be starved out ourselves."

     "Not at all!" said Admiral Bell, producing from his ample pockets 
various
parcels, -- "we came to bring you ample supplies."

     "Indeed!"

     "Yes; we have been as far as the ruins."

     "Oh, to release Marchdale.  Charles told me how the villain had fallen
into the trap he had laid for him."

     "He has, indeed, fallen into the trap, and it's one he won't easily get
out of again.  He's dead."

     "Dead! -- dead!"

     "Yes; in the storm of last night the ruins have fallen, and he is by 
this
time as flat as a pancake."

     "Good God! and yet it is but a just retribution upon him.  He would 
have
assassinated poor Charles Holland in the cruelest and most cold-blooded
manner, and, however we may shudder at the manner of his death, we cannot
regret it."

     "Except that he has escaped your friend the hangman," said the admiral.

     "Don't call him my friend, if you please," said Dr. Chillingworth, 
"but,
hark how he is working away, as if he really intended to carry the house 
away
piece by piece, as opportunity may serve, if you will not let it to him
altogether, just as it stands."

     "Confound him! he is evidently working on his own account," said the
admiral, "or he would not be half so industrious."

     There was, indeed, a tremendous amount of hammering and noise, of one
sort and another, from the house, and it was quite clear that the hangman 
was
too heart and soul in his work, whatever may have been the object of it, to
care who was listening to him, or to what conjecture he gave rise.

     He thought probably that he could but be stopped in what he was about,
and, until he was so, that he might as well go on.

     And on he went, with a vengeance, vexing the admiral terribly, who
proposed so repeatedly to go into the house and insist upon knowing what he
was about, that his wishes were upon the point of being conceded to by 
Henry,
although they were combatted by the doctor, when, from the window at which 
he
had entered, out stepped the hangman.

     "Good morning, gentlemen! good morning," he said, and he moved towards
the garden gate.  "I will not trouble you any longer.  Good morning!"

     "Not so fast," said the admiral, "or we may bring you up with a round
turn, and I never miss my mark when I can see it, and I shall not let it get
out of sight, you may depend."

     He drew a pistol from his pocket, as he spoke, and pointed it at the
hangman, who, thereupon, paused and said: --

     "What! am I not to be permitted to go in peace?  Why it was but a short
time since the doctor was quarrelling with me because I did not go, and now 
it
seems that I am to be shot if I do."

     "Yes," said the admiral, "that's it."

     "Well! but, ---"

     "You dare," said he, "stir another inch towards the gate, and you are a
dead man!"

     The hangman hesitated a moment, and looked at Admiral Bell; apparently
the result of the scrutiny was, that he would keep his word, for he suddenly
turned and dived in at the window again without saying another word.

     "Well; you have certainly stopped him from leaving," said Henry; "but
what's to be done now?"

     "Let him be, let him be," said the doctor; "he must come out again, for
there are no provisions in the place, and he will be starved out."

     "Hush! what is that?" said Henry.

     There was a very gentle ring at the bell which hung over the garden 
gate.

     "That's an experiment, now, I'll be bound," said the doctor, "to
ascertain if any one is here; let us hide ourselves, and take no notice."

     The ring in a few moments was repeated, and the three confederates hid
themselves effectually behind some thick laurel bushes and awaited with
expectation what might next ensue.

     Not long had they occupied their place of concealment, before they 
heard
a heavy fall upon the gravelled pathway, immediately within the gate, as if
some one had clambered to the top from the outside, and then jumped down.

     That this was the case the sound of footsteps soon convinced them, and 
to
their surprise as well as satisfaction, they saw through the interstices of
the laurel bush behind which they were concealed, no less a personage that
[sic] Sir Francis Varney himself.

     "It is Varney," said Henry.

     "Yes, yes," whispered the doctor.  "Let him be, do not move for any
consideration, for the first time let him do just what he likes."

     "D--n the fellow!" said the admiral; "there are some points about him
that I like, after all, and he's quite an angel compared to that rascal
Marchdale."

     "He is, -- he saved Charles."

     "He did, and not if I know it shall any harm come to him, unless he 
were
terribly to provoke it by becoming himself the assailant."

     "How sad he looks!"

     "Hush! he comes nearer; it is not safe to talk.  Look at him."

 Next Time: Varney in the Garden. -- The Communication of Dr. Chillingworth 
to
 the Admiral and Henry.




                               Chapter LXXVII.

VARNEY IN THE GARDEN. -- THE COMMUNICATION OF DR. CHILLINGWORTH TO THE 
ADMIRAL
AND HENRY.


     Kind reader, it was indeed Varney who had clambered over the garden 
wall,
and thus made his way into the garden of Bannerworth Hall; and what filled
those who looked at him with the most surprise was, that he did not seem in
any particular way to make a secret of his presence, but walked on with an 
air
of boldness which either arose from a feeling of absolute impunity, from his
thinking there was no one there, or from an audacity which none but he could
have compassed.

     As for the little party that was there assembled, and who looked upon
him, they seemed thunderstricken by his presence; and Henry, probably, as 
well
as the admiral, would have burst out into some sudden exclamation, had they
not been restrained by Dr. Chillingworth, who, suspecting that they might in
some way give an alarm, hastened to speak first, saying in a whisper, --

     "For Heaven's sake, be still; fortune, you see, favours us most
strangely. Leave Varney alone.  You have no other mode whatever of 
discovering
what he really wants at Bannerworth Hall."

     "I am glad you have spoken," said Henry, as he drew a long breath.  "If
you had not, I feel convinced that in another moment I should have rushed
forward and confronted this man who has been the very bane of my life."

     "And so should I," said the admiral; "although I protest against any 
harm
being done to him, on account of some sort of good feeling that he has
displayed, after all, in releasing Charles from that dungeon in which
Marchdale has perished."

     "At the momemt," said Henry, "I had forgotten that; but I will own that
his conduct has been tinctured by a strange and wild kind of generosity at
times, which would seem to bespeak, at the bottom of his heart, some good
feelings, the impulses of which were only quenched by circumstances."

     "That is my firm impression of him, I can assure you," said Dr.
Chillingworth.

     They watched Varney now from the leafy covert in which they were
situated, and, indeed, had they been less effectually concealed, it did not
seem likely that the much dreaded vampyre would have perceived them; for not
only did he make no effort at concealment himself, but he took no pains to 
see
if any one was watching him in his progress to the house.

     His footsteps were more rapid than they usually were, and there was
altogether an air and manner about him, as if he were moved to some purpose
which of itself was sufficiently important ot submerge in its consequences 
all
ordinary risks and all ordinary cautions.

     He tried several windows of the house along that terrace of which we 
have
more than once had occasion to speak, before he found one that opened; but 
at
length he did succeed, and stepped at once into the Hall, leaving those, who
now for some moments in silence had regarded his movements, to lose 
themselves
in a fearful sea of conjecture as to what could possiblly be his object.

     "At all events," said the admiral, "I'm glad we are here.  If the 
vampyre
should have a fight with that other fellow, that we heard doing such a lot 
of
carpentering work in the house, we ought, I think, to see fair play."

     "I, for one," said the doctor, "would not like to stand by and see the
vampyre murdered; but I am inclined to think he is a good match for any 
mortal
opponent."

     "You may depend he is," said Henry.  "But how long, doctor, do you
purpose that we should wait here in such a state of suspense as to what is
going on within the house?"

     "I hope not long; but that something will occur to make us have food 
for
action.  Hark! what is that?"

     There was a loud crash within the building, as of broken glass.  It
sounded as if some window had been completely dashed in; but although they
looked carefully over the front of the building, they could see no evidences
of such a thing having happened, and were compelled, consequently, to come 
to
the opinion that Varney and the other man must have met in one of the back
rooms, and that the crash of glass had arisen from some personal conflict in
which they had engaged.

     "I cannot stand this," said Henry.

     "Nay, nay," said the doctor; "be still, and I will tell you something,
than which there can be no more fitting time than this to reveal it."

     "Refers it to the vampyre?"

     "It does-- it does."

     "Be brief, then; I am in an agony of impatience."

     "It is a circumstance concerning which I can be brief; for, horrible as
it is, I have no wish to dress it in any adventitious colours.  Sir Francis
Varney, although under another name, is an old acquaintance of mine."

     "Acquaintance!" said Henry.

     "Why, you don't mean to say you are a vampyre?" said the admiral; "or
that he has ever visited you?"

     "No; but I knew him.  From the first moment that I looked upon him in
this neighbourhood, I thought I knew him; but the circumstance which induced
me to think so was of so terrific a character, that I made some efforts to
chase it from my mind.  It has, however, grown upon me day by day, and,
lately, I have had proof sufficient to convince me of his identity with one
whom I first saw under most singular circumstances of romance."

     "Say on, -- you are agitated."

     "I am, indeed.  This revelation has several times, within the last few
days, trembled on my lips, but now you shall have it; because you ought to
know all that it is possible for me to tell you of him who has caused you so
serious an amount of disturbance."

     "You awaken, doctor," said Henry, "all my interest."

     "And mine, too," remarked the admiral.  "What can it be all about? and
where, doctor, did you first see this Varney the vampyre?"

     "In his coffin."

     Both the admiral and Henry gave starts of surprise as, with one accord,
they exclaimed, --

     "Did you say coffin?"

     "Yes; I tell you, on my word of honour, that the first time in my life 
I
saw ever Sir Francis Varney, was in his coffin."

     "Then he is a vampyre, and there can be no mistake," said the admiral.

     "Go on, I pray you, doctor, go on," said Henry, anxiously.

     "I will.  The reason why he became the inhabitant of a coffin was 
simply
this: -- he had been hanged, -- executed at the Old Bailey, in London, 
before
ever I set eyes upon that strange countenance of his.  You know that I was
practising surgery at the London schools some years ago, and that,
consequently as I commenced the profession rather late in life, I was
extremely anxious to do the most I could in a very short space of time."

     "Yes-- yes."

     "Arrived, then, with plenty of resources, which I did not, as the young
men who affected to be studying in the same classes as myself, spend in the
pursuit of what they considered life in London, I was indefatigable in my
professional labours, and there was nothing connected with them which I did
not try to accomplish.

     "At that period, the difficulty of getting a subject for anatomization
was very great, and all sorts of schemes had to be put into requistion to
accomplish so desirable, and, indeed, absolutely necessary a purpose.

     "I became acquainted with the man who, I have told you, is in the Hall,
at present, and who then filled the unenviable post of public executioner.  
It
so happened too, that I had read a learned treatise, by a Frenchman, who had
made a vast number of experiments with galvanic and other apparatus, upon
persons who had come to death in different ways, and, in one case, he 
asserted
that he had actually recovered a man who had been hanged, and he had lived
five weeks afterwards.

     "Young as I then was, in comparison to what I am now, in my profession,
this inflamed my imagination, and nothing seemed to me so desirable as 
getting
hold of some one who had only recently been put to death, for the purpose of
trying what I could do in the way of attempting a resuscitation of the
subject.  It was precisely for this reason that I sought out the public
executioner, and made his acquaintance, whom every one else shunned, because 
I
thought he might assist me by handing over to me the body of some condemned
and executed man, upon whom I could try my skill.

     "I broached the subject to him, and found him not averse.  He said, 
that
if I would come forward and claim, as next of kin, the body of the criminal
who was to be executed the first time, from that period, that he could give 
me
a hint that I should have no real next of kin opponents, he would throw 
every
facility in my way, and allow the body to be removed to his house.

     "This was just what I wanted; and, I believe, I waited with impatience
for some poor wretch to be hurried to his last account by the hands of my
friend, the public executioner.

     "At length a circumstance occurred which favoured my designs most
effectually, -- a man was apprehended for a highway robbery of a most
agravated character.  He was tried, and the evidence against him was so
conclusive, that the defence which was attempted by his counsel, became a 
mere
matter of form.

     "He was convicted, and sentenced.  The judge told him not to flatter
himself with the least notion that mercy would be extended to him. The crime
of which he had been found guilty was on the increase; it was highly 
necessary
to make some great public example, to show evil doers that they could not,
with impunity, thus trample upon the liberty of the subject, and had 
suddenly,
just as it were, in the very nick of time, committed the very crime, 
attended
with all the aggravated circumstances which made it easy and desirable to 
hang
him out of hand.

     "He heard his sentence, they tell me, unmoved.  I did not see him, but 
he
was represented to me as a man of a strong, and well-knit frame, with rather 
a
strange, but what some would have considered a handsome expression of
countenance, inasmuch as that there was an expression of much haughty
resolution depicted on it.

     "I flew to my friend, the executioner.

     "'Can you,' I said, 'get me that man's body, who is to be hanged for 
the
highway robbery, on Monday?'

     "'Yes,' he said; 'I see nothing to prevent it.  Not one soul has 
offered
to claim even common companionship with him, -- far less kindred.  I think 
if
you in your claim as a cousin, who will bear the expense of his decent 
burial,
you will have every chance of getting possession of the body.'

     "I did not hesitate, but, on the morning before the execution, I called
upon one of the sheriffs.

     "I told him that the condemned man, I regretted to say, was related to
me; but as I knew nothing could be done to save him on the trial, I had
abstained from coming forward; but that as I did not like the idea of his
being rudely interred by the authorities, I had come forward to ask for the
body, after the execution should have taken place, in order that I might, at
all events, bestow upon it, in some sequestered spot, a decent burial, with
all the rites of the church.

     "The sheriff was a man not overburthened with penetration.  He 
applauded
my pious feelings, and actually gave me, without any inquiry, a written 
order
to receive the body from the hands of the hangman, after it had hung the 
hour
prescribed by the law.

     "I did not, as you may well suppose, wish to appear more in the 
business
than was absoulutely necessary; but I gave the executioner the sheriff's 
order
for the body, and he promised that he would get a shell ready to place it 
in,
and four stout men to carry it at once to his house, when he should cut it
down.

     "'Good!" I said; 'and now as I am not a little anxious for the success 
of
my experiment, do you not think that you can manage so that the fall of the
criminal shall not be so sudden as to break his neck?'

     "'I have thought of that,' he said, 'and I believe that I can manage to
let him down gently, so that he shall die of suffocation, instead of having
his neck put out of joint.  I will do my best.'

     "'If you can but succeed in that,' said I, for I was quite in a state 
of
mania upon the subject, 'I shall be much indebted to you, and will double 
the
amount of money which I have already promised.'

     "This was, as I believed it would be, a powerful stimulus to him to do
all in his power to meet my wishes, and he took, no doubt, active measures 
to
accomplish all that I desired.

     "You can imagine with what intense impatience I waited the result.  He
resided in an old ruinous looking house, a short distance on the Surrey side
of the river, and there I had arranged all my apparatus for making 
experiments
upon the dead man, in an apartment the windows of which commanded a view of
the entrance."

     "I was completely ready by half-past eight, although a moment's
consideration of course told me that at least another hour must elapse 
before
there could be the least chance of my seeing him arrive, for whom I so
anxiously longed.

     "I can safely say so infatuated was I upon the subject, that no fond
lover ever looked with more nervous anxiety for the arrival of the chosen
object of his heart, than I did for that dead body, upon which I proposed to
exert all the influences of professional skill, to recall back he soul to 
its
earthly dwelling-place.

     "At length I heard the sound of wheels.  I found that my friend the
hangman had procured a cart, in which he brought the coffin, that being a 
much
quicker mode of conveyance than by bearers, so that about a quarter past 
nine
o'clock the vehicle, with its ghastly contents, stopped at the door of his
house.

     "In my impatience I ran down stairs to meet that which ninety-nine men
out of a hundred would have gone some distance to avoid the sight of, 
namely,
a corpse, livid and fresh from the gallows.  I, however, heralded it as a
great gift, and already, in imagination, I saw myself imitating the learned
Frenchman, who had published such an elaborate treatise on the mode of
restoring life under all sorts of circumstances, to those who were already
pronounced by unscientific persons to be dead.

     "To be sure, a sort of feeling had come over me at times, knowing as I
did that the French are a nation that do not scruple at all to sacrifice 
truth
on the altar of vanity, that it might be after all a mere rhodomontade; but,
however, I could only ascertain so much by actually trying, so the suspicion
that such might, by a possibility, be the end of the adventure, did not 
deter
me.

     "I officiously assisted in having the coffin brought into the room 
where
I had prepared everything that was necessary in the conduction of my grand
experiment; and then, when no one was there with me but my friend the
executioner, I, with his help, the one of us taking the head and the other 
the
feet, took the body from the coffin and laid it upon a table.

     "Hastily I placed my hand upon the region of the heart, and to my great
delight I found it still warm.  I drew off the cap that covered the face, 
and
then, for the first time, my eyes rested upon the countenance of him who now
calls himself-- Heaven only knows why-- Sir Francis Varney."

     "Good God!" said Henry, "are you certain?"

     "Quite."

     "It may have been some other rascal like him," said the admiral.

     "No, I am quite sure now; I have, as I have before mentioned to you,
tried to get out of my own conviction upon the subject, but I have been
actually assured that he is the man by the very hangman himself."

     "Go on, go on!  Your tale certainly is a strange one, and I do not say 
it
either to  compliment you or to cast a doubt upon you, but, except from the
lips of an old and valued friend, such as you yourself are, I should not
believe it."

     "I am not surprised to hear you say that," replied the doctor; "nor
should I be offended even now if you were to entertain a belief that I 
might,
after all, be mistaken."

     "No, no; you would not be so positive upon the subject, I well know, if
there was the slightest possibility of an error."

     "Indeed I should not."

     "Let us have the sequel, then."

     "It is this.  I was most anxious to effect an immediate resuscitation, 
if
it were possible, of the hanged man.  A little manipulation soon convinced 
me
that the neck was not broken, which left me at once everything to hope for. 
The hangman was more prudent than I was, and before I commenced my
experiments, he said, --

     "'Doctor, have you duly considered what you mean to do with this 
fellow,
in case you should be successful in restoring him to life?'

     "'Not I,' said I.

     "'Well,' he said, 'you can do as you like; but I consider that it is
really worth thinking of.'

     "I was headstrong on the matter, and could think of nothing but the
success or the non-success, in a physiological point of view, of my plan for
restoring the dead to life; so I set about my experiments without any delay,
and with a completeness and a vigour that promised the most completely
successful results, if success could at all be an ingredient in what sober
judgment would doubtless have denominated a mad-headed and wild scheme.

     "For more than half an hour I tried in vain, by the assistance of the
hangman, who acted under my directions.  Not the least symptom of vitality
presented itself; and he had a smile upon his countenance, as he said in a
bantering tone, --

     "'I am afraid, sir, it is much easier to kill than to restore their
patients with doctors.'

     "Before I could make him any reply, for I felt that his observation had 
a
good amount of truth in it, joined to its sarcasm, the hanged man uttered a
loud scream, and opened his eyes.

     "I must own I was myself rather startled; but I for some moments longer
continued the same means which had produced such an effect, when suddenly he
sprang up and laid hold of me, at the same time exclaiming, --

     "'Death, death, where is the treasure?'

     "I had fully succeeded-- too fully; and while the executioner looked on
with horror depicted in his countenance, I fled from the room and the house,
taking my way home as fast as I possibly could.

     "A dread came over me, that the restored man would follow me if he 
should
find out to whom it was he was indebted for the rather questionable boon of 
a
new life.  I packed up what articles I set the greatest store by, bade adieu
to London, and never have I since set foot within that city."

     "And you never met the man you had so resuscitated?"

     "Not till I saw Varney, the vampyre; and, as I tell you, I am now 
certain
that he is the man."

     "That is the strangest yarn that ever I heard," said the admiral.

     "A most singular circumstance," said Henry.

     "You may have noticed about his countenance," said Dr. Chillingworth, 
"a
strange distorted look?"

     "Yes, yes."

     "Well, that has arisen from a spasmodic contraction of the muscles, in
consequence of his having been hanged.  He will never lose it, and it has 
not
a little contributed to give him the horrible look he has, and to invest him
with some of the seeming outward attributes of the vampyre."

     "And that man who is now in the hall with him, doctor," said Henry, "is
the very hangman who executed him?"

     "The same.  He tells me that after I left, he paid attention to the
restored man, and completed what I had nearly done.  He kept him in his 
house
for a time, and then made a bargain with him, for a large sum of money per
annum, all of which he has regularly been paid, although he tells me he has 
no
more idea where Varney gets it, than the man in the moon."

     "It is very strange; but, hark! do you not hear the sound of voices in
angry altercation?"

     "Yes, yes, they have met.  Let us approach the windows now.  We may
chance to hear something of what they say to each other."

 Next Time: The Altercation Between Varney and the Executioner in the Hall. 
--
 The Mutual Agreement.




                              Chapter LXXVIII.

THE ALTERCATION BETWEEN VARNEY AND THE EXECUTIONER IN THE HALL. -- THE 
MUTUAL
AGREEMENT.


     There was certainly a loud wrangling in the Hall, just as the doctor
finished his most remarkable revelation concerning Sir Francis Varney, a
revelation which by no means attacked the fact of his being a vampyre or 
not;
but rather on the contrary, had a tendency to confirm any opinion that might
arise from the circumstance of his being restored to life after his 
execution,
favourable to that belief.

     They all three now carefully approached the windows of the Hall, to
listen to what was going on, and after a few moments they distinctly heard 
the
voice of the hangman, saying in loud and rather angry accents, --

     "I do not deny but that you have kept your word with me-- our bargain 
has
been, as you say, a profitable one; but, still I cannot see why that
circumstance should give you any sort of control over my actions."

     "But what do you here?" said Varney, impatiently.

     "What do you?" cried the other.

     "Nay, to ask another question, is not to answer mine.  I tell you that 
I
have special and most important business in this house; you can have no 
motive
but curiosity."

     "Can I not, indeed?  What, too, if I have serious and important 
business
here?"

     "Impossible."

     "Well, I may as easily use such a term as regards what you call 
important
business, but here I shall remain."

     "Here you shall not remain."

     "And will you make the somewhat hazardous attempt to force me to 
leave?"

     "Yes, much as I dislike lifting my hand against you, I must do so; I 
tell
you that I must be alone in this house.  I have most special reasons-- 
reasons
which concern my continued existence."

     "Your continued existence you talk of. -- Tell me, now, how is it that
you have acquired so frightful a reputation in this neighbourhood?  Go where 
I
will, the theme of conversation is Varney, the vampyre! and it is implicitly
believed that you are one of those dreadful characters that feed upon the
life-blood of others, only now and then revisiting the tomb to which you 
ought
long since to have gone in peace."

     "Indeed!"

     "Yes; what, in the name of all that's inexplicable, has induced you to
enact such a character?"

     "Enact it! you say.  Can you, then, from all you have heard of me, and
from all you know of me, not conceive it possible that I am not enacting any
such character?  Why may it not be real?  Look at me.  Do I look like one of
the inhabitants of the earth?"

     "In sooth, you do not."

     "And yet I am, as you see, upon it.  Do not, with an affected 
philosophy,
doubt all that may happen to be in any degree repugnant to your usual
experiences."

     "I am not one disposed to do so; nor am I prepared to deny that such
dreadful beings may exist as vampyres.  However, whether or not you belong 
to
so frightful a class of creatures, I do not intend to leave here; but, I 
will
make an agreement with you."

     Varney was silent; and after a few moments' pause, the other exclaimed, 
--

     "There are people, even now, watching the place, and no doubt you have
been seen coming into it."

     "No, no, I was satisfied no one was here but you."

     "Then you are wrong.  A Doctor Chillingworth, of whom you know 
something,
is here; and him, you have said, you would do no harm to, even to save your
life."

     "I do know him.  You told me that it was to him that I was mainly
indebted for my mere existence; and although I do not consider human life to
be a great boon, I cannot bring myself to raise my hand against the man who,
whatever might have been the motives for the deed, at all events, did snatch
me from the grave."

     "Upon my word," whispered the admiral, "there is something about that
fellow that I like, after all."

     "Hush!" said Henry, "listen to them.  This would all have been
unintelligible to us, if you had not related to us what you have."

     "I have just told you in time," said Chillingworth, "it seems."

     "Will you then," said the hangman, "listen to proposals?"

     "Yes," said Varney.

     "Come along, then, and I will show you what I have been about; and I
rather think you have already a shrewd guess as to my motive.  This way-- 
this
way."

     They moved off to some other part of the mansion, and the sound of 
their
voices gradually died away, so that after all, the friends had not got the
least idea of what that motive was, which still induced the vampyre and the
hangman, rather than leave the other on the premises, to make an agreement 
to
stay with each other.

     "What's to be done now?" said Henry.

     "Wait," said Dr. Chillingworth, "wait, and watch still.  I see nothing
else that can be done with any degree of safety."

     "But what are we to wait for?" said the admiral.

     "By waiting, we shall, perhaps, find out," was the doctor's reply; "but
you may depend that we never shall by interfering."

     "Well, well, be it so.  It seems that we have no other resource.  And
when either or both of those fellows make their appearance, and seem about 
to
leave, what is to be done with them?"

     "They must be seized then, and in order that that may be done without 
any
bloodshed, we ought to have plenty of force here.  Henry, could you get your
brother, and Charles, if he be sufficiently recovered, to come?"

     "Certainly, and Jack Pringle."

     "No," said the admiral, "no Jack Pringle for me; I have done with him
completely, and I have made up my mind to strike him off the ship's books, 
and
have nothing more to do with him."

     "Well, well," added the doctor, "we will not have him, then; and it is
just as well, for, in all likelihood, he would come drunk, and we shall be--
let me see-- five strong without him, which ought to be enough to take
prisoners two men."

     "Yes," said Henry, "although one of them may be a vampyre."

     "That makes no difference," said the admiral.  "I'd as soon take a ship
manned with vampyres as with Frenchmen."

     Henry started off upon his errand, certainly leaving the admiral and 
the
doctor in rather a critical situation while he was gone; for had Varney the
vampyre and the hangman chosen, they could certainly easily have overcome so
inefficient a force.

     The admiral would, of course, have fought, and so might the doctor, as
far as his hands would permit him; but if the others had really been intent
upon mischief, they could, from their downright superior physical power, 
have
taken the lives of the two that were opposed to them.

     But somehow the doctor appeared to have a great confidence in the 
affair. 
Whether that confidence arose from what the vampyre had said with regard to
him, or from any hidden conviction of his own that they would not yet emerge
from the Hall, we cannot say; but certain it is, he waited the course of
events with great coolness.

     No noise for some time came from the house; but then the sounds, as if
workmen were busy within it, were suddenly resumed, and with more vigour 
than
before.

     It was nearly two hours before Henry made the private signal which had
been agreed upon as that which should proclaim his return; and then he and 
his
brother, with Charles, who, when he heard of the matter, would,
notwithstanding the persuasions of Flora to the contrary, come, got quietly
over the fence at a part of the garden which was quite hidden from the house
by abundant vegetation, and the whole three of them took up a position that
tolerably well commanded a view of the house, while they were themselves
extremely well hidden behind a dense mass of evergreens.

     "Did you see that rascal, Jack Pringle?" said the admiral.

     "Yes," said Henry; "he is drunk."

     "Ah, to be sure."

     "And we had no little difficulty in shaking him off.  He suspected 
where
we were going; but I think, by being peremptory, we got fairly rid of him."

     "The vagabond! if he comes here, I'll brain him, I will, the swab.  
Why,
lately he's done nothing but drink.  That's the way with him.  He'll go on
sometimes for a year and more, and not take more than enough to do him good,
and then all at once, for about six or eight weeks, he does nothing but
drink."

     "Well, well, we can do without him," said Henry.

     "Without him!  I should think so.  Do you hear those fellows in the 
Hall
at work?  D--n me, if I haven't all of a sudden thought what the reason of 
it
all is."

     "What-- what?" said the doctor, anxiously.

     "Why, that rascal Varney, you know, had his house burnt down."

     "Yes; well?"

     "Yes, well.  I dare say he didn't think it well.  But, however, he no
doubt wants another; so, you see, my idea is, that he's stealing the 
material
from Bannerworth Hall."

     "Oh, is that your notion?"

     "Yes, and a very natural one, I think, too, Master Doctor, whatever you
may think of it.  Come, now, have you a better?"

     "Oh, dear, no, certainly not; but I have a notion that something to eat
would comfort the inward man much."

     "And so would something to drink, blow me if it wouldn't," said Jack
Pringle, suddenly making his appearance.

     The admiral made a rush upon him; but he was restrained by the others,
and Jack, with a look of triumph, said, --

     "Why, what's amiss with you now?  I ain't drunk now.  Come, come, you
have something dangerous in the wind, I know, so I've made up my mind to be 
in
it, so don't put yourself out of the way.  If you think I don't know all 
about
it, you are mistaken, for I do.  The vampyre is in the house yonder, and I'm
the fellow to tackle him, I believe you, my boys."

     "Good God!" said the doctor, "what shall we do?"

     "Nothing," said Jack, as he took a bottle from his pocket and applied 
the
neck of it to his lips-- "nothing-- nothing at all."

     "There's something to begin with," said the admiral, as with his stick 
he
gave the bottle a sudden blow that broke it and spilt all its contents,
leaving Jack petrified, with the bit of the neck of it still in his mouth.

     "My eye, admiral," he said, "was that done like a British seaman?  My
eye-- was that the trick of a lubber, or of a thorough-going first-rater?  
My
eye---"

     "Hold your noise, will you; you are not drunk yet, and I was determined
that you should not get so, which you soon would with that rum-bottle, if I
had not come with a broadside across it.  Now you may stay; but, mark me, 
you
are on active service now, and must do nothing without orders."

     "Ay, ay, your honour," said Jack, as he dropped the neck of the bottle,
and looked ruefully upon the ground, from whence arose the aroma of rum-- 
"ay,
ay; but it's a hard case, take it how you will, to have your grog stopped;
but, d--n it, I never had it stopped yet when it was in my mouth."

     Henry and Charles could not forbear a smile at Jack's discomfiture,
which, however, they were very glad of, for they knew full well his failing,
and that in the course of another half hour he would have been drunk, and
incapable of being controlled, except, as on some former occasions, by the
exercise of brute force.

     But Jack was evidently displeased, and considered himself to be
grievously insulted, which, after all, was the better, inasmuch as, while he
was brooding over his wrongs, he was quiet; when, otherwise, it might have
been a very difficult matter to make him so.

     They partook of some refreshments, and, as the day advanced, the 
brothers
Bannerworth, as well as Charles Holland, began to get very anxious upon the
subject of the proceedings of Sir Francis Varney in the Hall.

     They conversed in low tones, exhausting every, as they considered,
possible conjecture to endeavour to account for his mysterious predilection
for that abode, but nothing occurred to them of a sufficiently probable
motive to induce them to adopt it as a conclusion.

     They more than suspected Dr. Chillingworth, because he was so silent, 
and
hazarded no conjecture at all of knowing something, or of having formed to
himself some highly probable hypothesis upon the subject; but they could not
get him to agree that such was the case.

     When they challenged him upon the subject, all he would say was, --

     "My good friends, you perceive that there is a great mystery somewhere,
and I do hope that to-night it will be cleared up satisfactorily."

     With this they were compelled to be satisfied; and now the soft and
sombre shades of evening began to creep over the scene, enveloping all 
objects
in the dimness and repose of early night.

     The noise from the house had ceased, and all was profoundly still.  But
more than once Henry fancied he heard footsteps outside the garden.

     He mentioned his suspicions to Charles Holland, who immediately said, -
-

     "The same thing has come to my ears."

     "Indeed!  Then it must be so; we cannot both of us have merely imagined
such a thing.  You may depend that this place is beleaguered in some way, 
and
that to-night will be productive of events which will throw a great light 
upon
the affairs connected with this vampyre that have hitherto baffled
conjecture."

     "Hush!" said Charles; "there, again; I am quite confident I heard a 
sound
as of a broken twig outside the garden-wall.  The doctor and the admiral are
in deep discussion about something, -- shall we tell them?"

     "No; let us listen, as yet."

     They bent all their attention to listening, inclining their ears 
towards
the ground, and, after a few moments, they felt confident that more than one
footstep was creeping along, as cautiously as possible, under the garden 
wall. 
After a few moments' consultation, Henry made up his mind-- he being the 
best
acquainted with the localities of the place-- to go and reconnoitre, so he,
without saying anything to the doctor or the admiral, glided from where he
was, in the direction of a part of the fence which he knew he could easily
scale.

 Bannerworth.




                                Chapter LXXIX.

THE VAMPYRE'S DANGER. -- THE LAST REFUGE. -- THE RUSE OF HENRY BANNERWORTH.


     Yet knowing to what deeds of violence the passions of a lawless mob 
will
sometimes lead them, and having the experience of what had been attempted by
the alarmed and infuriated populace on a former occasion, against the Hall,
Henry Bannerworth was, reasonably enough, not without his fears that 
something
might occur of a nature yet highly dangerous to the stability of his ancient
house.

     He did not actually surmount the fence, but he crept so close to it, 
that
he could get over in a moment, if he wished; and, if any one should move or
speak on the other side, he should be quite certain to hear them.

     For a few moments all was still, and then suddenly he heard some one 
say,
in a low voice, --

     "Hist! hist! did you hear nothing?"

     "I thought I did," said another; "but I now am doubtful."

     "Listen again."

     "What," thought Henry, "can be the motives of these men lying secreted
here?  It is most extraordinary what they can possibly want, unless they are
brewing danger for the Hall."

     Most cautiously now he raised himself, so that his eyes could just look
over the fence, and then, indeed, he was astonished.

     He had expected to see two or three persons, at the utmost; what was 
his
surprise to find a compact mass of men crouching down under the garden wall,
as far as his eye could reach.

     For a few moments, he was so surprised, that he continued to gaze on,
heedless of the danger there might be from a discovery that he was playing 
the
part of a spy upon them.

     When, however, his first sensations of surprise were over, he 
cautiously
removed to his former position, and, just as he did so, he heard those who 
had
before spoken, again, in low tones, breaking the stillness of the night.

     "I am resolved upon it," said one; "I am quite determined.  I will,
please God, rid the country of that dreadful man."

     "Don't call him a man," said the other.

     "Well, well; it is a wrong name to apply to a vampyre."

     "It is Varney, after all, then," said Henry Bannerworth, to himself; --
"it is his life that they seek.  What can be done to save him? -- for saved 
he
shall be if I can compass such an object.  I feel that there is yet a
something in his character which is entitled to consideration, and he shall
not be savagely murdered while I have an arm to raise in his defence.  But 
if
anything is now to be done, it must be done by stratagem, for the enemy are,
by far, in too great force to be personally combatted with."

     Henry resolved to take the advice of his friends, and with that view he
went silently and quietly back to where they were, and communicated to them
the news that he had so unexpectedly discovered.

     They were all much surprised, and then the doctor said,

     "You may depend, that since the disappointment of the mob in the
destruction of this place, they have had their eye upon Varney.  He has been
dogged here by some one, and then by degrees that assemblage has sought the
spot."

     "He's a doomed man, then," remarked the admiral; "for waht can save him
from a determined number of persons, who, by main force, will overcome us, 
let
us make what stand we may in his defence."

     "Is there no hiding-place in the house." said Charles, "where you 
might,
after warning him of his danger, conceal him?"

     "There are plenty, but of what avail would that be, if they burn down 
the
Hall, which in all probability they will?"

     "None, certainly."

     "There is but one chance," said Henry, "and that is to throw them off 
the
scent, and induce them to think that he whom they seek is not here; I think
that may possibly be done by boldness."

     "But how?"

     "I will go among them and make the effort."

     He at once left the friends, for he felt that there might be no time to
lose, and hastening to the same part of the wall, over which he had looked 
so
short a time before, he clambered over it, and cried, in a loud voice,

     "Stop the vampyre! stop the vampyre!"

     "Where, where?" shouted a number of persons at once, turning their eyes
eagerly towards the spot where Henry stood.

     "There, across the fields," cried Henry.  "I have lain in wait for him
long; but he has eluded me, and is making his way again towards the old 
ruins,
where I am sure he has some hiding-place that he thinks will elude all 
search.
There, I see his dusky form speeding onwards."

     "Come on," cried several; "to the ruins! to the ruins!  We'll smoke him
out if he will not come by fair means: we must have him, dead or alive."

     "Yes, to the ruins!" shouted the throng of persons, who up to this time
had preserved so cautious a silence, and, in a few moments more, Henry
Bannerworth had the satisfaction of finding that his ruse had been perfectly
successful, for Bannerworth Hall and its vicinity were completely deserted,
and the mob, in a straggling mass, went over hedge and ditch towards those
ruins in which there was nothing to reward the exertions they might choose 
to
make in the way of an exploration of them, but the dead body of the villain
Marchdale, who had come there to so dreadful, but so deserved a death.

                               Chapter LXXX.

THE DISCOVERY OF THE BODY OF MARCHDALE IN THE RUINS BY THE MOB. -- THE 
BURNING
OF THE CORPSE. -- THE MURDER OF THE HANGMAN.


     The mob reached the ruins of Bannerworth Hall, and crowded  round it on
all sides, with the view of ascertaining if a human  creature, dead or 
alive,
were there; various surmises were  afloat, and some were for considering 
that
everybody but  themselves, or their friends, must be nothing less than 
vampyres.  Indeed, a strange man, suddenly appearing among them,  would have
caused a sensation, and a ring would no doubt have  been formed round him, 
and
then a hasty council held, or, what  was more probable, some shout, or word
uttered by some one  behind, who could not understand what was going on in
front,  would have determined them to commit some desperate outrage, and  
the
sacrifice of life would have been the inevitable result of  such an
unfortunate concurrence of circumstances.

     There was a pause before any one ventured among the ruins;  the walls
were carefully looked to, and in more than one  instance, but they were 
found
dangerous, what were remaining;  some parts had been so completely 
destroyed,
that there was  nothing but heaps of rubbish.

     However, curiosity was exerted to such an extraordinary  pitch that it
overcame the fear of danger, in search of the  horrible; for they believed
that if there were any one in the  ruins he must be a vampyre, of course, 
and
they were somewhat  cautious in going near such a creature, lest in so doing
they  should meet with some accident, and become vampyres too.

     This was a dreadful reflection, and one that every now and  then
impressed itself upon the individuals composing the mob;  but at the same 
time
any new impulse, or a shout, and they  immediately became insensible to all
fear; and mere impulse is  the dominant one, and then all is forgotten.

     The scene was an impressive one; the beautiful house and  grounds 
looked
desolate and drear; many of the trees were  stripped and broken down, and 
many
scorched and burned, while  the gardens and flower beds, the delight of the
Bannerworth  family, were rudely trodden under foot by the rabble, and all 
those little beauties so much admired and tended by the  inhabitants, were 
now
utterly destroyed, and in such a state  that their site could not even be
detected by their former  owners.

     It was a sad sight to see such a sacrilege committed, --  such violence
done to private feelings, as to have all these  places thrown open to the
scrutiny of the brutal and vulgar,  who are incapable of appreciating or
understanding the pleasures  of a refined taste.

     The ruins presented a remarkable contrast to what the place  had been 
but
a very short time before; and now the scene of  desolation was complete, 
there
was no one spot in which the most  wretched could find shelter.

     To be sure, under the lee of some broken and crumbling  wall, that
tottered, rather than stood, a huddled wretch might  have found shelter from
the wind, but it would have been at the  risk of his life, and not there
complete.

     The mob became quiet for some moments, but was not so long;  indeed, a
mob of people, -- which is, in fact, always composed  of the most disorderly
characters to be found in a place, is  not exactly the assembly that is most
calculated for quietness;  somebody gave a shout, and then somebody else
shouted, and the  one wide throat of the whole concourse was opened, and 
sent 
forth a mighty yell.

     After this exhibition of power, they began to run about  like mad, --
traverse the ground from one end to the other, and  then the ruins were in
progress of being explored.

     This was a tender affair, and had to be done with some care  and 
caution
by those who were so engaged; and they walked over  crumbling and decayed
masses.

     In one or two places, they saw what appeared to be large  holes, into
which the building materials had been sunk, by their  own weight, through 
the
flooring, that seemed as roofs to some  cellars or dungeons.

     Seeing this, they knew not how soon some other part might  sink in, and
carry their precious bodies down with the mass of  rubbish; this gave an
interest to the scene, -- a little danger  is a sort of salt to an 
adventure,
and enables those who have  taken their part in it to talk of their 
exploits,
and of their  dangers, which is pleasant to do, and to hear in the ale-
house, 
and by the inglenook in the winter.

     However, when a few had gone some distance, others   followed, when 
they
saw them enter the place in safety: and  at length the whole ruins were
covered with living men, and not  a few women, who seemed necessary to make 
up
the elements of  mischief in this case.

     There were some shouting and hallooing from one to the  other as they
hurried about the ruins.

     At length they had explored the ruins nearly all over, when  one man, 
who
had stood a few minutes upon a spot, gazing  intently upon something, 
suddenly
exclaimed, --

     "Hilloa! hurrah! here we are, altogether, -- come on, --  I've found 
him,
I've found -- recollect it's me and nobody else  has found, -- hurrah!"

     Then, with a wild kind of frenzy, he threw his hat up  into the air, as
if to attract attention, and call others round  him, to see what it was he 
had
found.

     "What's the matter, Bill?" exclaimed one who came up to him,  and who 
had
been close at hand.

     "The matter? why, I've found him; that's the matter, old  man," replied
the first.

     "What, a whale?"

     "No, a wampyre; the blessed wampyre! there he is, -- don't  you see him
under them ere bricks?"

     "Oh, that's not him; he's got away."

     "I don't care," replied the other, "who got away, or who  didn't; I 
know
this much, that he's a wampire, -- he wouldn't be  there if he warn't."

     This was an unanswerable argument, and nobody could deny  it;
consequently, there was a cessation of talk, and the people  then came up, 
as
the two first were looking at the body.

     "Whose is it?" inquired a dozen voices.

     "Not Sir Francis Varney's?" said the second speaker; "the  clothes are
not his -- "

     "No, no; not Sir Francis's."

     "But I tell you what, mates," said the first speaker; "that  if it 
isn't
Sir Francis Varney's, it is somebody else's as bad.   I dare say, now, he's 
a
wictim."

     "A what?"

     "A wictim to the wampyre; and, if he sees the blessed  moonlight, he 
will
be a wampyre hisself, and so shall we be,  too, if he puts his teeth into 
us."

     "So we shall, -- so we shall," said the mob, and their  flesh began to
run cold, and there was feeling of horror  creeping over the whole body of
persons within hearing.

     "I tell you what it is; our only plan will be to get him  out of the
ruins, then," remarked another.

     "What!" said one; "who's going to handle such cattle? if  you've a sore
about you, and his blood touches you, who's to say  you won't a be a 
vampyre,
too!"

     "No, no you won't," said an old woman.

     "I won't try," was the happy rejoinder; "I ain't a-going to  carry a
wampyre on my two legs home to my wife and small family  of seven children,
and another a-coming."

     There was a pause for a few moments, and then one man more  adventurous
than the rest, exclaimed, --

     "Well, vampyre, or no vampyre, his dead body can harm no  one; so here
goes to get it out, help me who will; once have it  out, and then we can
prevent any evil, by burning it, and thus  destroying the whole body."

     "Hurrah!" shouted three or four more, as they jumped down  into the 
hole
formed by the falling in of the materials which  had crushed Marchdale to
death, for it was his body they had  discovered.

     They immediately set to work to displace such of the  materials as lay 
on
the body, and then, having cleared it of all  superincumbent rubbish, they
proceeded to lift it up, but found  that it had got entangled, as they 
called
it, with some chains:   with some trouble they got them off, and the body 
was
lifted out  to a higher spot.

     "Now, what's to be done?" inquired one.

     "Burn it," said another.

     "Hurrah!" shouted a female voice; "we've got the wampyre!  run a stake
through his body, and then place him upon some dry  wood, -- there's plenty 
to
be had about here, I am sure, -- and  then burn him to a cinder."

     "That's right, old woman, -- that's right," said a man;  "nothing 
better:
the devil must be in him if he come to life  after that, I should say."

     There might be something in that, and the mob shouted its  approbation,
as it was sure to do at anything stupid or  senseless, and the proposal 
might
be said to have been carried by  acclamation, and it required only the
execution.

     This was soon done.  There were plenty of laths and  rafters, and the
adjoining wood furnished an abundant supply of  dry sticks, so there was no
want of fuel.

     There was a loud shout as each accession of sticks took  place, and, as
each individual threw his bundle into the heap,  each man felt all the self-
devotion to the task as the Scottish  chieftain who sacrificed himself and
seven sons in the battle  for his superior; and, when one son was cut down,
the man  filled up his place with the exclamation, -- "Another for  Hector,"
until he himself fell as the last of his race.

     Soon now the heap became prodigious, and it required an  effort to get
the mangled corpse upon his funeral bier; but it  was then a shout from the
mob that rent the air announced both  the fact and their satisfaction.

     The next thing to be done was to light the pile -- this was  no easy
task; but like all others, it was accomplished, and the  dead body of the
vampyre's victim was thrown on to prevent that  becoming a vampyre too, in 
its
turn.

     "There, boys," said one, "he'll not see the moonlight,  that's certain,
and the sooner we put a light to this the  better: for it may be, the 
soldiers
will be down upon us before  we know anything of it; so, now, who's got a
light?"

     This was a question that required a deal of searching; but,  at length
one was found, by one of the mob coming forward, and  after drawing his pipe
vigorously for some moments, he collected  some scraps of paper, upon which 
he
emptied the contents of the  pipe, with the hope they would take fire.

     In this, however, he was doomed to disappointment; for it  produced
nothing but a deal of smoke, and the paper burned  without producing any
flame.

     This act of disinterestedness, however, was not without its  due
consequences, for there were several who had pipes, and  first with the hope
of emulating the first projector of the  scheme for raising the flame, they
joined together, and putting  the contents of their pipes together on some
paper, straw, and  chips, they produced, after some little trouble, a flame.

     Then there was a shout, and the burning mass was then placed  in a
favourable position nearer the pile of materials collected  for burning, and
then, in a few moments, it began to take light;  one piece communicated the
fire to another, until the whole was  in a blaze.

     When the first flame fairly reached the top, a loud and  tremendous 
shout
arose from the mob, and the very welkin  reechoed with its fullness.

     Then the forked flames rushed through the wood, and hissed  and 
crackled
as they flew, throwing up huge masses of black  smoke, and casting a 
peculiar
reflection around.  Not a sound  was heard save the hissing and roaring of 
the
flames, which  seemed like the approaching of a furious whirlwind.

     At length there was nothing to be seen but the blackened  mass; it was
enveloped in one huge flame, that threw out a  great heat, so much so, that
those nearest to it felt induced to  retire from before it.

     "I reckon," said one, "that he's pretty well done by this  time -- he's
had a warm berth of it up there."

     "Yes," said another, "farmer Watkins's sheep he roasted  whole at last
harvest-home hadn't such a fire as this, I'll  warrant; there's no such fire
in the county -- why, it would  prevent a frost, I do believe it would."

     "So it would, neighbour," answered another.

     "Yes," replied a third, "but you'd want such a one corner  of each 
field
though."

                        *    *    *    *

     There was much talk and joking going on among the men who  stood 
around,
in the midst of which, however, they were  disturbed by a loud shout, and 
upon
looking in the quarter  whence it came, they saw stealing from among the
ruins, the  form of a man.

     He was a strange, odd looking man, and at the time it was  very 
doubtful
among the mob as to whom it was -- nobody could  tell, and more than one
looked at the burning pile, and then at  the man who seemed to be so
mysteriously present, as if they  almost imagined that the body had got 
away.

     "Who is it?" exclaimed one.

     "Danged if I knows," said another, looking very hard, and  very white 
at
the same time; -- "I hope it ain't the chap what  we've burned here jist 
now."

     "No," said the female, "that you may be sure of, for he's  had a stake
through his body, and as you said, he can never get  over that, for as the
stake is consumed, so are his vitals, and  that's a sure sign he's done 
for."

     "Yes, yes, she's right -- a vampyre may live upon blood,  but cannot do
without his inside."

     This was so obvious to them all, that it was at once  conceded, and a
general impression pervaded the mob that it  might be Sir Francis Varney: a
shout ensued.

     "Hurrah! -- After him -- there's a vampyre -- there he  goes! -- after
him -- catch him -- burn him!"

     And a variety of other exclamations were uttered, at the  same time; 
the
victim of popular wrath seemed to be aware that  he was now discovered, and
made off with all possible  expedition, towards some wood.

     Away went the mob in pursuit, hooting and hallooing like  demons, and
denouncing the unfortunate being with all the  terrors that could be 
imagined,
and which naturally added  greater speed to the unfortunate man.

     However, some among the mob, seeing that there was every  probability 
of
the stranger's escaping at a mere match of speed,  brought a little cunning 
to
bear upon the matter, and took a  circuit round, and thus intercepted him.

     This was not accomplished without a desperate effort, and  by the best
runners, who thus reached the spot he made for,  before he could get there.

     When the stranger saw himself thus intercepted, he  endeavoured to fly 
in
a different direction; but was soon  secured by the mob, who made somewhat
free with his person, and  commenced knocking him about.

     "Have mercy on me," said the stranger.  "What do you want?   I am not
rich; but take all I have."

     "What do you do here?" inquired twenty voices.  "Come, tell  us that --
what do you do here, and who are you?"

     "A stranger, quite a stranger to these parts."

     "Oh, yes! he's a stranger; but that's all the worse for him  -- he's a
vampyre -- there's no doubt about that."

     "Good God," said the man, "I am a living and breathing man  like
yourselves.  I have done no wrong, and injured no man -- be  merciful unto 
me;
I intend no harm."

     "Of course not; send him to the fire -- take him back to  the ruins -- 
to
the fire."

     "Ay, and run a stake through his body, and then he's safe  for life.  I
am sure he has something to do with the vampyre;  and who knows, if he ain't 
a
vampyre, how soon he may become  one?"

     "Ah! that's very true; bring him back to the fire, and  we'll try the
effects of the fire upon his constitution."

     "I tell you what, neighbour, it's my opinion, that as one  fool makes
many, so one vampyre makes many."

     "So it does; there's much truth and reason in that  neighbour; I am
decidedly of that opinion, too."

     "Come along then," cried the mob, cuffing and pulling the  unfortunate
stranger with them.

     "Mercy, mercy!"

     But it was useless to call for mercy to men whose  superstitious 
feelings
urged them on; for when the demon of  superstition is active, no matter what
form it may take, it  always results in cruelty and wickedness to all.

     Various were the shouts and menaces of the mob, and the  stranger, who
was certainly a somewhat odd and remarkable  looking man, and who appeared 
in
their eyes the very  impersonation of their notions of a vampyre, was thrust
from one  to the other, kicked by one, and then cuffed by the other, as if  
he
was doomed to run the gauntlet.

     "Down with the vampyre!" said the mob.

     "I am no vampyre," said the stranger; "I am new to these  parts, and I
pray you have mercy upon me.  I have done you no  wrong.  Hear me, -- I know
nothing of these people of whom you  speak."

     "That won't do; you've come here to see what you can do, I  dare say;
and, though you may have been hurt by the vampyre,  and may be only your
misfortune, and not your fault, yet the  mischief is as great as ever it was
or can be, you become, in  spite of yourself, a vampyre, and do the same
injury to others  that has been done to you -- there's no help for you."

     "No help, -- we can't help it," shouted the mob; "he must  die, -- 
throw
him on the pile."

     "Put a stake through him first, though," exclaimed the  humane female;
"put a stake through him and then he's safe."

     This horrible advice had an electric effect on the  stranger, who 
jumped
up, and eluded the grasp of several hands  that were stretched forth to 
seize
him.

     "Throw him upon the burning wood!" shouted one.

     "And a stake through his body," suggested the humane  female again, who
seemed to have this one idea in her heart, and  no other, and, upon every
available opportunity, she seemed to  be anxious to give utterance to the
comfortable notion.

     "Seize him!" exclaimed one.

     "Never let him go," said another; "we've gone too far to  hang back 
now;
and, if he escape, he will visit us in our sleep,  were it only out of 
spite."

     The stranger made a dash among the ruins, and, for a moment,  out-
stripped his pursuers; but a few, more adventurous than the  rest, succeeded
in driving him into an angle formed by two  walls, and the consequence was, 
he
was compelled to come to a  stand.

     "Seize him -- seize him!" exclaimed all those at a  distance.

     The stranger, seeing he was now nearly surrounded, and had  no chance 
of
escape, save by some great effort, seized a long  piece of wood, and struck
two of his assailants down at once,  and then dashed through the opening.

     He immediately made for another part of the ruins, and  succeeded in
making his escape for some short distance, but was  unable to keep up the
speed that was required, for his great  exertion before had nearly exhausted
him, and the fear of a  cruel death before his eyes was not enough to give 
him
strength,  or lend speed to his flight.  He had suffered too much from 
violence, and, though he ran with great speed, yet those who  followed were
uninjured, and fresher, -- he had no chance.

     They came very close upon him at the corner of a field,  which he
endeavoured to cross, and had succeeded in doing, and  he made a desperate
attempt to scramble up the bank that divided  the field from the next, but 
he
slipped back, almost exhausted,  into the ditch, and the whole mob came up.

     However, he got on the bank, and leaped into the next  field, and then 
he
was immediately surrounded by those who  pursued him, and he was struck 
down.

     "Down with the vampyre! -- kill him, -- he's one of 'em, --  run a 
stake
through him!" were a few of the cries of the  infuriated mob of people, who
were only infuriated because he  attempted to escape their murderous
intentions.

     It was strange to see how they collected in a ring as the  unfortunate
man lay on the ground, panting for breath, and  hardly able to speak -- 
their
infuriated countenances plainly  showing the mischief they were intent upon.

     "Have mercy upon me!" he exclaimed, as he lay on the earth;  "I have no
power to help myself."

     The mob returned no answer, but stood collecting their  numbers as they
came up.

     "Have mercy on me! it cannot be any pleasure to you to  spill my blood. 
I am unable to resist -- I am only one man  among many, -- you surely cannot
wish to beat me to death?"

     "We want to hurt no one, except in our own defence, and we  won't be 
made
vampyres of because you don't like to die."

     "No, no; we won't be vampyres," exclaimed the mob, and  there arose a
great shout from the mob.

     "Are you men -- fathers? -- have you families? if so, I  have the same
ties as you have; spare me for their sakes, -- do  not murder me, -- you 
will
leave one an orphan if you do;  besides, what have I done?  I have injured 
no
one."

     "I tell you what, friends, if we listen to him we shall all  be 
vampyres,
and all our children will all be vampyres and  orphans."

     "So we shall, so we shall; down with him!"

     The man attempted to get up, but, in doing so, he received  a heavy 
blow
from a hedge-stake, wielded by the herculean arm of  a peasant.  The sound 
of
the blow was heard by those immediately  around, and the man fell dead.  
There
was a pause, and those  nearest, apparently fearful of the consequences, and
hardly  expecting the catastrophe, began to disperse, and the remainder  did
so very soon afterwards.

 Next Time: The Vampyre's Flight. -- His Danger, and the Last Place of 
Refuge.




                                Chapter LXXXI.

THE VAMPYRE'S FLIGHT. -- HIS DANGER, AND THE LAST PLACE OF REFUGE.


     Leaving the disorderly and vicious mob, who were thus sacrificing human
life to their excited passions, we return to the brothers Bannerworth and 
the
doctor, who together with Admiral Bell, still held watch over the hall.

     No indication of the coming forth of Varney presented itself for some
time longer, and then, at least they thought, they heard a window open; and,
turning their eyes in the direction whence the sound proceeded, they could 
see
the form of a man slowly and cautiously emerging from it.

     As far as they could judge, from the distance at which they were, that
form partook much of the appearance and the general aspect of Sir Francis
Varney, and the more they looked and noticed its movements the more they 
felt
convinced that such was the fact.

     "There comes your patient, doctor," said the admiral.

     "Don't call him my patient," said the doctor, "if you please."

     "Why you know he is; and you are, in a manner of speaking, bound to 
look
after him.  Well, what is to be done?"

     "He must not, on any account," said Dr. Chillingworth, "be allowed to
leave the place.  Believe me, I have the very strongest reasons for saying
so."

     "He shall not leave it then," said Henry.

     Even as he spoke, Henry Bannerworth darted forward, and Sir Francis
Varney dropped from the window, out of which he had clambered, close to his
feet.

     "Hold!" cried Henry, "you are my prisoner."

     With the most imperturbable coolness in the world, Sir Francis Varney
turned upon him, and replied, --

     "And pray, Henry Bannerworth, what have I done to provoke your wrath?"

     "What have you done? -- have you not, like a thief, broken into my 
house?
Can you ask what you have done?"

     "Ay," said the vampyre, "like a thief, perchance, and yet no thief.  
May
I ask you, what there is to steal, in the house?"

     By the time this short dialogue had been uttered, the rest of the party
had come up, and Varney was, so far as regarded numbers, a prisoner.

     "Well, gentlemen," he said, with that strange contortion of countenance
which, now they all understood, arose from the fact of his having been 
hanged,
and restored to life again.  "Well, gentlemen, now that you have beleagured 
me
in such a way, may I ask you what it is about?"

     "If you will step aside with me, Sir Francis Varney, for a moment," 
said
Dr. Chillingworth, "I will make you a communication which will enable you to
know what it is all about."

     "Oh, with pleasure," said the vampyre.  "I am not ill at present; but
still, sir, I have no objection to hear what you have to say."

     He stepped a few paces on one side with the doctor, while the others
waited, not without some amount of impatience for the result of the
communication.  All that they could hear was, that Varney said, suddenly --

     "You are quite mistaken."

     And then the doctor appeared to be insisting upon something, which the
vampyre listened to patiently; and, at the end, burst out with, --

     "Why, doctor, you must be dreaming."

     At this, Dr. Chillingworth at once left him, and advancing to his
friends, he said, --

     "Sir Francis Varney denies in toto all that I have related to you
concerning him; therefore, I can say no more than that I earnestly recommend
you, before you let him go, see that he takes nothing of value with him."

     "Why, what can you mean?" said Varney.

     "Search him," said the doctor; "I will tell you why, very shortly."

     "Indeed -- indeed!" said Sir Francis Varney.  "Now, gentlemen, I will
give you a chance of behaving justly and quietly, so saving yourself the
danger of acting otherwise.  I have made repeated offers to take this house,
either as a tenant or as a purchaser, all of which offers have been 
declined,
upon, I dare say, a common enough principle, namely, one which induces 
people
to enhance the value of anything they have for disposal, if it be unique, by
making it difficult to come at.  Seeing that you had deserted the place, I
could make no doubt but that it was to be had, so I came here to make a
thorough examination of its interior, to see if it would suit me.  I find 
that
it will not; therefore, I have only to apologise for the intrusion, and to
wish you a remarkably good evening."

     "That won't do," said the doctor.

     "What won't do, sir?"

     "This excuse will not do, Sir Francis Varney.  You are, although you 
deny
it, the man who was hanged in London some years ago for a highway robbery."

     Varney laughed, and held up his hands, exclaiming, --

     "Alas! alas! our good friend, the doctor, has studied too hard; his 
wits,
probably, at the best of times, none of the clearest, have become hopelessly
entangled."

     "Do you deny," said Henry, "then that you are that man?"

     "Most unequivocally."

     "I assert it," said the doctor, "and now, I will tell you all, for I
perceive you hesitate about searching, Sir Francis Varney, I tell you all 
why
it is that he has such an affection for Bannerworth Hall."

     "Before you do," said Varney, "there is a pill for you, which you may
find more nauseous and harder of digestion, than any your shop can furnish."

     As Varney uttered these words, he suddenly drew from his pocket a 
pistol,
and, leveling it at the unfortunate doctor, he fired it full at him.

     The act was so sudden, so utterly unexpected, and so stunning, that it
was done before any one could move hand or foot to prevent it.  Henry
Bannerworth and his brother were the furthest off from the vampyre; and,
unhappily, in the rush which they, as soon as possible, made towards him, 
they
knocked down the admiral, who impeded them much; and, before they could 
spring
over, or past him, Sir Francis Varney was gone.

     So sudden, too, had been his departure, that they had not the least 
idea
in which direction he had gone; so that to follow him would have been a work
of the greatest possible difficulty.

     Notwithstanding, however, both the difficulty and the danger, for no
doubt the vampyre was well enough armed, Henry and his brother both rushed
after the murderer, as they now believed him to be, in the route which they
thought it was most probable he would take, namely, that which led towards 
the
garden gate.

     They reached that spot in a few moments, but all was profoundly still. 
Not the least trace of any one could be seen, high or low, and they were
compelled, after a cursory examination, to admit that Sir Francis Varney had
again made his escape, despite the great odds that were against him in point
of numbers.

     "He has gone," said Henry.  "Let us go back, and see into the state of
poor Dr. Chillingworth, who, I fear, is a dead man."

     They hurried back to the spot, and there they found the admiral looking
as composed as possible, and solacing himself with a pinch of snuff, as he
gazed upon the apparently lifeless form at his feet.

     "Is he dead?" said Henry.

     "I should say he was," replied the admiral; "such a shot as that was
don't want to be repeated.  Well, I liked the doctor with all his faults.  
He
only had one foolish way with him and that was, that he shirked his grog."

     "This is an awful catastrophe," said Henry, as he knelt down by the 
side
of the body.  "Assist me, some of you.  Where is Charles?"

     "I'll be hanged," said the admiral, "if I know.  He disappeared
somewhere."

     "This is a night of mystery as well as terror.  Alas! poor Dr.
Chillingworth!  I little thought that you would have fallen a victim to the
man whom you preserved from death.  How strange it is that you should have
snatched from the tomb the very individual who was, eventually, to take your
own life."

     The brothers gently raised the body of the doctor, and carried it on to
the grass plot, which was close at hand.

     "Farewell, kind and honest-hearted Chillingworth," said Henry; "I 
shall,
many and many a time, feel your loss; and now I will rest not until I have
delivered up to justice your murderer.  All consideration, or feeling, for
what seemed to be latent virtues in that strange and inexplicable man, 
Varney,
shall vanish, and he shall reap the consequences of the crime he has now
committed."

     "It was a cold blooded, cowardly murder," said his brother.

     "It was; but you may depend the doctor was about to reveal something to
us, which Varney so much dreaded, that he took his life as the only 
effectual
way, at the moment, of stopping him."

     "It must be so," said Henry.

     "And now," said the admiral, "it's too late, and we shall not know it 
at
all.  That's the way.  A fellow saves up what he has got to tell till it is
too late to tell it, and down he goes to Davy Jones's locker with all his
secrets aboard."

     "Not always," said Dr. Chillingworth, suddenly sitting bolt upright --
"not always."

     Henry and his brother started back in amazement, and the admiral was so
taken by surprise, that had not the resuscitated doctor suddenly stretched 
out
his hand and laid hold of him by the ankle, he would have made a precipitate
retreat.

     "Hilloa! murder!" he cried.  "Let me go!  How do I know but you may be 
a
vampyre by now, as you were shot by one."

     Henry soonest recovered from the surprise of the moment, and with the
most unfeigned satisfaction, he cried, --

     "Thank God you are unhurt, Dr. Chillingworth!  Why he must have missed
you by a miracle."

     "Not at all," said the doctor.  "Help me up -- thank you -- all right. 
I'm only a little singed about the whiskers.  He hit me safe enough."

     "Then how have you escaped?"

     "Why from the want of a bullet in the pistol, to be sure. I can
understand it all well enough.  He wanted to create sufficient confusion to
cover a desperate attempt to escape, and he thought that would be best done 
by
seeming to shoot me.  The suddenness of the shock, and the full belief, at 
the
moment, that he had sent a bullet into my brains, made me fall, and produced 
a
temporary confusion of ideas, amounting to insensibility."

     "From which you are happily recovered.  Thank Heaven for that, after 
all,
he is not such a villain as this act would have made him."

     "Ah!" said the admiral, "it takes people who have lived little in these
affairs to know the difference in sound between a firearm with a bullet in 
it
and one without.  I knew it was all right."

     "Then why did you not say so, admiral?"

     "What was the use?  I thought the doctor might be amused to know what 
you
should say of him, so you see I didn't interfere; and, as I am not a good 
hand
at galloping after anybody, I didn't try that part of the business, but just
remained where I was."

     "Alas! alas!" cried the doctor, "I much fear that, by his going, I have
lost all that I expected to be able to do for you, Henry.  It's of not the
least use now telling you or troubling you about it.  You may now sell or 
let
Bannerworth Hall to whomever you please, for I am afraid it is really
worthless."

     "What on earth do you mean?" said Henry.  "Why, doctor, will you keep 
up
this mystery among us?  If you have anything to say, why not say it at 
once?"

     "Because, I tell you it's of no use now.  The game is up, Sir Francis
Varney has escaped; but still I don't know that I need exactly hesitate."

     "There can be no reason for your hesitating about making a 
communication
to us," said Henry.  "It is unfriendly not to do so."

     "My dear boy, you will excuse me for saying that you don't know what 
you
are talking about."

     "Can you give any reason?"

     "Yes; respect for the living.  I should have to relate something about
the dead which would be hurtful to their feelings."

     Henry was silent for a few moments, and then he said, --

     "What dead?  And who are the living?"

     "Another time," whispered the doctor to him; "another time, Henry.  Do
not press me now.  But you shall know all another time."

     "I must be content.  But now let us remember that another man yet 
lingers
in Bannerworth Hall.  I will endure suspense on his account no longer.  He 
is
an intruder there; so I go at once to dislodge him."

     No one made any opposition to this move, not even the doctor; so Henry
preceeded them all to the house.  They passed through the open window into 
the
long hall, and from thence into every apartment of the mansion, without
finding the object of their search.  But from one of the windows up to which
there grew great masses of ivy, there hung a rope, by which any one might
easily have let himself down; and no doubt, therefore, existed in all their
minds that the hangman had sufficiently profited by the confusion incidental
to the supposed shooting of the doctor, to make good his escape from the
place.

     "And so, after all," said Henry, "we are completely foiled?"

     "We may be," said Dr. Chillingworth; "but it is, perhaps, going too far
to say that we actually are.  One thing, however, is quite clear; and that 
is,
no good can be done here."

     "Then let us go home," said the admiral.  "I did not think from the 
first
that any good would be done here."

     They all left the garden together now; so that almost for the first 
time,
Bannerworth Hall was left to itself, unguarded and unwatched by any one
whatever.  It was with an evident and marked melancholy that the doctor
proceeded with the party to the cottage-house of the Bannerworths; but, as
after what he has said, Henry forebore to question him further upon those
subjects which he admitted he was keeping secret; and as none of the party
were much in a cue for general conversation, the whole of them walked on 
with
more silence than usually characterized them.

 Next Time: Charles Holland's Pursuit of the Vampyre. -- The Dangerous
 Interview.




                              Chapter LXXXII.

CHARLES HOLLAND'S PURSUIT OF THE VAMPYRE. -- THE DANGEROUS INTERVIEW.


     It will be recollected that the admiral had made a remark about Charles
Holland having suddenly disappeared; and it is for us now to account for 
that
disappearance and to follow him to the pathway he had chosen.

     The fact was, that he, when Varney fired the shot at the doctor, or 
what
was the supposed shot, was the farthest from the vampyre; and he, on that 
very
account, had the clearest and best opportunity of marking which route he 
took
when he had discharged the pistol.

     He was not confused by the smoke, as the others were; nor was he 
stunned
by the noise of the discharge; but he distinctly saw Varney dart across one 
of
the garden beds, and make for the summer house, instead of for the garden
gate, as Henry had supposed was the most probable path he had chosen.

     Now, Charles Holland either had an inclination, for some reasons of his
own, to follow the vampyre alone; or, on the spur of the moment, he had not
time to give an alarm to the others; but certain it is that he did, unaided,
rush after him.  He saw him enter the summer-house, and pass out of it again
at the back portion of it, as he had once before done, when surprised in his
interview with Flora.

     But the vampyre did not now, as he had done on the former occasion, 
hide
immediately behind the summer-house.  He seemed to be well aware that that
expedient would not answer twice; so he at once sped onwards, clearing the
garden fence, and taking to the meadows.

     It formed evidently no part of the intentions of Charles Holland to 
come
up with him.  He was resolved upon dogging his footsteps, to know where he
should go; so that he might have a knowledge of his hiding-place if he had
one.

     "I must and will," said Charles to himself, "penetrate the mystery that
hangs about this most strange and inexplicable being.  I will have an
interview with him, not in hostility, for I forgive him the evil he has done
me, but with a kindly spirit; and I will ask him to confide in me."

     Charles, therefore, did not keep so close upon the heels of the vampyre
as to excite any suspicions of his intention to follow him; but he waited by
the garden paling long enough not only for Varney to get some distance off,
but long enough likewise to know that the pistol which had been fired at the
doctor had produced no real bad effects, except singing some curious tufts 
of
hair upon the sides of his face, which the doctor was pleased to call
whiskers.

     "I thought as much," was Charles's exclamation when he heard the 
doctor's
voice.  "It would have been strikingly at variance with all Varney's other
conduct, if he had committed such a deliberate and heartless murder."

     Then, as the form of the vampyre could be but dimly seen, Charles ran 
on
for some distance in the direction he had taken, and then paused again; so
that if Varney heard the sound of footsteps, and paused to listen they had
ceased again probably, and nothing was discernible.

     In this manner he followed the mysterious individual, if we may really
call him such, for above a mile; and then Varney made a rapid detour, and 
took
his way towards the town.

     He went onwards with wonderful precision now in a right line, not
stopping at any obstruction, in the way of fences, hedges, or ditches, so 
that
it took Charles some exertion, to which, just then, he was scarcely equal, 
to
keep up with him.

     At length the outskirts of the town were gained, and then Varney 
paused,
and looked around him, scarcely allowing Charles, who was now closer to him
than he had been, time to hide himself from observation, which, however, he
did accomplish, by casting himself suddenly upon the ground, so that he 
could
not be detected against the sky, which then formed a back ground to the spot
where he was.

     Apparently satisfied that he had completely now eluded pursuit, if any
had been attempted, of those whom he had left in such a state of confusion,
the vampyre walked hastily towards a house which was to let, and which was
only to be reached by going up an avenue of trees, and then unlocking a gate
in a wall which bounded the premises next to the avenue.  But the vampyre
appeared to be possessed of every facility for effecting an entrance to the
place and, producing from his pocket a key, he at once opened the gate, and
disappeared within the precincts of those premises.

     He, no doubt, felt that he was hunted by the mob of the town, and hence
his frequent change of residence, since his own had been burnt down, and,
indeed, situated as he was, there can be no manner of doubt that he would 
have
been sacrificed to the superstitious fury of the populace, if they could but
have got hold of him.

     He had, from his knowledge, which was no doubt accurate and complete, 
of
what had been done, a good idea of what his own fate would be, were he to 
fall
into the hands of that ferocious multitude; each individual composing which,
felt a conviction that there would be no peace, nor hope of prosperity or
happiness, in the place, until he, the arch vampyre of all the supposed
vampyres, was destroyed.

     Charles did pause for a few moments, after having thus become housed, 
to
consider whether he should then attempt to have the interview he had 
resolved
upon having by some means or another, or defer it, now that he knew where
Varney was to be found, until another time.

     But when he came to consider how extremely likely it was that, even in
the course of a few hours, Varney might shift his abode for some good and
substantial reasons, he at once determined upon attempting to see him.

     But how to accomplish such a purpose was not the easiest question in 
the
world to answer.  If he rung the bell that presented itself above the garden
gate, was it at all likely that Varney, who had come there for concealment,
would pay any attention to the summons?

     After some consideration, he did, however, think of a plan by which, at
all events, he could ensure effecting an entrance into the premises, and 
then
he would take his chance of finding the mysterious being whom he sought, and
who probably might have no particular objection to meeting with him, Charles
Holland, because their last interview in the ruins could not be said to be
otherwise than of a peaceable and calm enough character.

     He saw by the board, which was nailed in front of the house, that all
applications to see it were to be made to a Mr. Nash, residing close at 
hand;
and, as Charles had the appearance of a respectable person, he thought he
might possibly have the key entrusted to him, ostensibly to look at the 
house,
preparatory possibly to taking it, and so he should, at all events, obtain
admission.

     He, accordingly, went at once to this Mr. Nash, and asked about the
house; of course he had to affect an interest in its rental and
accommodations, which he did not feel, in order to lull any suspicion, and,
finally, he said, --

     "I should like to look over it if you will lend me the key, which I 
will
shortly bring back to you."

     There was an evident hesitation about the agent when this proposal was
communicated by Charles Holland, and he said, --

     "I dare say, sir, you wonder that I don't say yes, at once; but the 
fact
is there came a gentleman here one day when I was out, and got a key, for we
have two to open the house, from my wife, and he never came back again."

     That this was the means by which Varney, the vampyre, had obtained the
key, by the aid of which Charles had seen him effect so immediate an 
entrance
to the house, there could be no doubt.

     "How long ago were you served that trick?" he said.

     "About two days ago, sir."

     "Well, it only shows how, when one person acts wrongly, another is at
once suspected of a capability to do so likewise.  There is my name and
address; I should like rather to go alone to see the house, because I always
fancy I can judge better by myself of the accommodation, and I can stay as
long as I like, and ascertain the sizes of all the rooms without the
disagreeable feeling upon my mind, which no amount of complaisance on your
part could ever get me over, that I was most unaccountably detaining 
somebody
from more important business of their own."

     "Oh, I assure you, sir," said Mr. Nash, "that I should not be at all
impatient.  But if you would rather go alone -- "

     "Indeed I would."

     "Oh, then, sir, there is the key.  A gentleman who leaves his name and
address, of course, we can have no objection to.  I only told you of what
happened, sir, in the mere way of conversation, and I hope you won't imagine
for a moment that I meant to insinuate that you were going to keep the key."

     "Oh, certainly not -- certainly not," said Charles, who was only too 
glad
to get the key upon any terms.  "You are quite right, and I beg you will say
no more about it; I quite understand."

     He then walked off to the empty house again, and, proceeding to the
avenue, he fitted the key to the lock, and had the satisfaction of finding 
the
gate instantly yield to him.

     When he passed thought it, and closed the door after him, which he did
carefully, he found himself in a handsomely laid-out garden, and saw the 
house
a short distance in front of him, standing upon a well got-up lawn.

     He cared not if Varney should see him before he reached the house,
because the fact was sufficiently evident to himself that after all he could
not actually enforce an interview with the vampyre.  He only hoped that as 
he
had found him out it would be conceded to him.

     He, therefore, walked up the lawn without making the least attempt at
concealment, and when he reached the house he allowed his footsteps to make
what noise they would upon the stone steps which led up to it.  But no one
appeared; nor was there, either by sight or by sound, any indication of the
presence of any living being in the place besides himself.

     Insensibly, as he contemplated the deserted place around him, the 
solemn
sort of stillness began to have its effect upon his imagination, and, 
without
being aware that he did so, he had, with softness and caution, glided 
onwards,
as if he were bent on some errand requiring the utmost amount of caution and
discrimination in the conduction of it.

     And so he entered the hall of the house, where he stood some time, and
listened with the greatest attention, without, however, being able to hear 
the
least sound throughout the whole of the house.

     "And yet he must be here," thought Charles to himself; "I was not gone
many minutes, and it is extremely unlikely that in so short a space of time 
he
has left, after taking so much trouble, by making such a detour around the
meadows to get here, without being observed.  I will examine every room in 
the
place, but I will find him."

     Charles immediately commenced going from room to room of that house in
his search for the vampyre.  There were but four apartments upon the ground
floor, and these, of course, he quickly ran through.  Nothing whatever at 
all
indicative of any one having been there met his gaze, and with a feeling of
disappointment creeping over him, he commenced the ascent of the staircase.

     The day had now fairly commenced, so that there was abundance of light,
although, even for the country, it was an early hour, and probably Mr. Nash
had been not a little surprised to have a call from one whose appearance
bespoke no necessity for rising with the lark at such an hour.

     All these considerations, however, sank into insignificance in 
Charles's
mind, compared with the object he had in view, namely, the unravelling the
many mysteries that hung around that man.  He ascended to the landing of the
first story, and then, as he could have no choice, he opened the first door
that his eyes fell upon, and entered a tolerably large apartment.  It was
quite destitute of furniture, and at the moment Charles was about to 
pronounce
it empty; but then his eyes fell upon a large black-looking bundle of
something, that seemed to be lying jammed up under the window on the floor -
-
that being the place of all others in the room which was enveloped in the 
most
shadow.

     He started back involuntarily at the moment, for the appearance was one
so shapeless, that there was no such thing as defining, from even that
distance, what it really was.

     Then he slowly and cautiously approached it, as we always approach that
of the character of which we are ignorant, and concerning the powers of 
which
to do injury we can consequently have no defined idea.

     That it was a human form there, was the first tangible opinion he had
about it; and from its profound stillness, and the manner in which it seemed
to be laid close under the window, he thought that he was surely upon the
point of finding out that some deed of blood had been committed, the
unfortunate victim of which was now lying before him.

     Upon a nearer examination, he found that the whole body, including the
greater part of the head and face, was wrapped in a large cloak; and there, 
as
he gazed, he soon found cause to correct his first opinion as to the form
belonging to the dead, for he could distinctly hear the regular breathing, 
as
of some one in a sound and dreamless sleep.

     Closer he went, and closer still.  Then, as he clasped his hands, he
said, in a voice scarcely above a whisper, --

     "It is -- it is the vampyre."

     Yes, there could be no doubt of the fact.  It was Sir Francis Varney 
who
lay there, enveloped in the huge horseman's cloak, in which, on two or three
occasions during the progress of this narrative, he has figured.  There he
lay, at the mercy completely of any arm that might be raised against him,
apparently so overcome by fatigue that no ordinary noise would have awakened
him.

     Well might Charles Holland gaze at him with mingled feelings.  There 
lay
the being who had done almost enough to drive the beautiful Flora 
Bannerworth
distracted -- the being who had compelled the Bannerworth family to leave
their ancient house, to which they had been bound by every description of
association.  The same mysterious existence, too, who, the better to carry 
on
his plots and plans, had, by dint of violence, immured him, Charles, in a
dungeon, and loaded him with chains.  There he lay sleeping, and at his 
mercy.

     "Shall I awaken him," said Charles, "or let him sleep off the fatigue,
which, no doubt, is weighing down his limbs, and setting heavily on his
eyelids.  No, my business with him is too urgent."

     He then raised his voice, and cried, --

     "Varney, Varney, awake!"

     The sound disturbed, without altogether breaking up, the deep slumber 
of
the vampyre, and he uttered a low moan, and moved one hand restlessly.  
Then,
as if that disturbance of the calm and deep repose which had sat upon him, 
had
given at once the reign to fancy, he began to mutter strange words in his
sleep, some of which could be heard by Charles distinctly, while others were
too incoherently uttered to be clearly understood.

     "Where is it?" he said; "where -- where hidden? -- Pull the house down!
-- Murder! -- No, no, no! no murder! -- I will not, I dare not.  Blood 
enough
is upon my hands. -- The money! -- the money!  Down, villains! down! down!"

     What these incoherent words alluded to specifically, Charles, of 
course,
could not have the least idea, but he listened attentively, with a hope that
something might fall from his lips that would afford a key to some of the
mysterious circumstances with which he was so intimately connected.

     Now, however, there was a longer silence than before, only broken
occasionally by low moans; but suddenly, as Charles was thinking of again
speaking, he uttered some more disjointed sentences.

     "No harm," he said, "no harm, -- Marchdale is a villain! -- Not a hair 
of
his head injured -- no, no.  Set him free -- yes, I will set him free. 
Beware!
beware, Marchdale! and you, Mortimer.  The scaffold! ay, the scaffold! but
where is the bright gold?  The memory of the deed of blood will not cling to
it.  Where is it hidden?  The gold! the gold! the gold!  It is not in the
grave -- it cannot be there -- no, no, no! -- not there, not there!  Load 
the
pistols.  There, there!  Down, villain, down! -- down, down!"

     Despairing, now, of obtaining anything like tangible information from
these ravings, which, even if they did, by accident, so connect themselves
together as to seem to mean something, Charles again cried aloud, --

     "Varney, awake, awake!"

     But, as before, the sleeping man was sufficiently deaf to the cry to
remain, with his eyes closed, still in a disturbed slumber, but yet a 
slumber
which might last for a considerable time.

     "I have heard," said Charles, "that there are many persons whom no 
noise
will awaken, which the slightest touch rouses them in an instant.  I will 
try
that upon this slumbering being."

     As he spoke, he advanced close to Sir Francis Varney, and touched him
slightly with the toe of his boot.

     The effect was as startling as it was instantaneous.  The vampyre 
sprang
to his feet, as he had been suddenly impelled up by some powerful machinery;
and, casting his cloak away from his arms, so as to have them at liberty, he
sprang upon Charles Holland, and hurled him to the ground, where he held him
in a giant's gripe, as he cried, --

     "Rash fool! be you whom you may.   Why have you troubled me to rid the
world of your intrusive existence?"

     The attack was so sudden and so terrific, that resistance to it, even 
if
Charles had had the power, was out of the question.  All he could say, was, 
--

     "Varney, Varney! do you not know me?  I am Charles Holland.  Will you
now, in your mad rage, take the life you might more easily have taken when I
lay in the dungeon from which you released me?"

     The sound of his voice at once convinced Sir Francis Varney of his
identity; and it was with a voice that had some tones of regret in it, that 
he
replied, --

     "And wherefore have you thought proper, when you were once free and
unscathed, to cast yourself into such a position of danger as to follow me 
to
my haunt?"

     "I contemplated no danger," said Charles, "because I contemplated no
evil.  I do not know why you should kill me."

     "You came here, and yet you say you do not know why I should kill you.
Young man, have you a dozen lives that you can afford to tamper with them
thus?  I have, at much chance of imminence to myself, already once saved 
you,
when another, with a sterner feeling, would have gladly taken your life; but
now, as if you were determined to goad me to an act which I have shunned
committing, you will not let me close my eyes in peace."

     "Take you hand from off my throat, Varney, and I will then tell you 
what
brought me here."

     Sir Francis Varney did so.

     "Rise," he said -- "rise; I have seen blood enough to be sickened at 
the
prospect of more; but you should not have come here and tempted me."

     "Nay, believe me, I came here for good and not for evil.  Sir Francis
Varney, hear me out, and then judge for yourself whether you can blame the
perseverance which enabled me to find out this secret place of refuge; but 
let
me first say that now it is as good a place of concealment to you as before 
it
was, for I shall not betray you."

     "Go on, go on.  What is it you desire?"

     "During the long and weary hours of my captivity, I thought deeply, and
painfully too, as may be well imagined, of all the circumstances connected
with your appearance at Bannerworth Hall, and your subsequent conduct.  Then 
I
felt convinced that there was something far more than met the eye, in the
whole affair, and, from what I have been informed of since, I am the more
convinced that some secret, some mystery, which it is in your power only
perhaps to explain, lurks at the bottom of all your conduct."

     "Well, proceed," said Varney.

     "Have I not said enough now to enable you to divine the object of my
visit?  It is that you should shake off the trammels of mystery in which you
have shrouded yourself, and declare what it is you want, what it is you
desire, that has induced you to set yourself up such a determined foe to the
Bannerworth family."

     "And that, you say, is the modest request that brings you here?"

     "You speak as if you thought it was idle curiosity that prompts me, but
you know it is not.  Your language and manner are those of a man of too much
sagacity not to see that I have higher notions."

     "Name them."

     "You have yourself, in more than one instance, behaved with a strange
sort of romantic generosity, as if, but for some great object which you felt
impelled to seek by any means, and at any sacrifice, you would be something 
in
character and conduct very different from what you are.  One of my objects,
then, is to awaken that better nature which is slumbering within you, only 
now
and then rousing itself to do some deed which should be the character of all
your actions -- for your own sake I have come."

     "But not wholly?"

     "Not wholly, as you say.  There is another than whom, the whole world 
is
not so dear to me.  That other one was serene as she was beautiful.  
Happiness
danced in her eyes, and she ought -- for not more lovely is the mind that 
she
possesses than the glorious form that enshrines it -- to be happy.  Her life
would have passed like one long summer's day of beauty, sunshine, and pure
heavenly enjoyment.  You have poisoned the cup of joy that the great God of
nature had permitted her to place to her lips and taste of mistrustingly.  
Why
have you done this?"

     "Have you said all that you came to say?"

     "I have spoken the substance of my message.  Much could I elaborate 
upon
such a theme; but it is not one, Varney, which is congenial to my heart; for
your sake, however, and for the sakes of those whom I hold most dear, let me
implore you to act in this matter with a kindly consideration.  Proclaim 
your
motives; you cannot say that they are not such as we may aid you in."

     Varney was silent for several moments; he seemed perceptibly moved by 
the
manner of the young man, as well as by the matter of his discourse.  In 
fact,
one would suppose that Charles Holland had succeeded in investing what he 
said
with some sort to charm that won much upon the fancy of Sir Francis Varney,
for when he ceased to speak, the latter said in a low voice, --

     "Go on, go on; you have surely much more to say."

     "No, Varney; I have said enough, and not thus much would I have said 
had
I not been aware, most certainly and truly aware, without the shadow of a
doubt, by your manner, that you were most accessible to human feeling."

     "I accessible to human feeling! know you to whom you speak?  Am I not 
he
before whom all men shudder, whose name has been a terror and desolation; 
and
yet you can talk of my human feelings.  Nay, if I had had any, be sure they
would have been extinguished by the persecutions I have endured from those
who, you know, with savage ferocity have sought my life."

     "No, Varney; I give you credit for being a subtler reasoner than thus 
to
argue; you know well that you were the aggressor to those parties who sought
your life; you know well that with the greatest imaginable pains you held
yourself up to them as a thing of great terror."

     "I did -- I did."

     "You cannot, then, turn round upon ignorant persons, and blame them
because your exertions to make yourself seem what you wish were but too
successful."

     "You use the word _seem_," said Varney, with a bitterness of aspect, 
"as
if you would imply a doubt that I am that which thousands, by their fears,
would testify me to be."

     "Thousands might," said Charles Holland; "but not among them am I,
Varney; I will not be made the victim of superstition.  Were you to enact
before my very eyes some of those feats which, to the senses of others, 
would
stamp you as the preternatural being you assume to be, I would doubt the
evidence of my own senses ere I permitted such a bugbear to oppress my 
brain."

     "Go," said Sir Francis Varney, "go:  I have no more words for you; I 
have
nothing to relate to you."

     "Nay, you have already listened sufficiently to me to give me hope that 
I
had awakened some of the humanity that was in your nature.  Do not, Sir
Francis Varney, crush that hope, even as it was budding forth; not for my 
own
sake do I ask you for revelations; that may, perhaps -- must be painful for
you; but for the sake of Flora Bannerworth, to whom you own abundance of
reparation."

     "No, no."

     "In the name of all that is great, and good, and just, I call upon you
for justice."

     "What have I to do with such an invocation?  Utter such a sentiment to
men who, like yourself, are invested with the reality as well as the outward
show of human nature."

     "Nay, Sir Francis Varney, now you belie yourself.  You have passed
through a long, and, perchance, a stormy life.  Can you look back upon your
career, and find no reminiscences of the past that shall convince you that 
you
are of the great family of man, and have had abundance of human feelings and
human affections?"

     "Peace, peace!"

     "Nay, Sir Francis Varney, I will take your word, and if you will lay 
your
hand upon your heart, and tell me truly that you never felt what it was to
love -- to have all feeling, all taste, and all hope of future joy,
concentrated in one individual, I will despair, and leave you.  If you will
tell me that never, in your whole life, you have felt for any fair and
glorious creature, as I now feel for Flora Bannerworth, a being for whom you
could have sacrificed not only existence, but all the hopes of a glorious
future that bloom around it -- if you will tell me, with the calm,
dispassionate aspect of truth, that you have held yourself aloof from such
human feelings, I will no longer press you to a disclosure which I shall 
bring
no argument to urge."

     The agitation of Sir Francis Varney's countenance was perceptible, and
Charles Holland was about to speak again, when, striking him upon the breast
with his clinched hand, the vampyre checked him, saying --

     "Do you wish to drive me mad, that you thus, from memory's hidden 
cells,
conjure up images of the past?"

     "Then there are such images to conjure up -- there are such shadows 
only
sleeping, but which require only, as you did even now, but a touch to awaken
them to life and energy.  Oh, Sir Francis Varney, do not tell me that you 
are
not human."

     The vampyre made a furious gesture, as if he would have attacked 
Charles
Holland; but then he sank nearly to the floor, as if soul-stricken by some
recollection that unnerved his arm; he shook with unwonted emotion, and, 
from
the frightful livid aspect of his countenance, Charles dreaded some serious
accession of indisposition, which might, if nothing else did, prevent him 
from
making the revelation he so much sought to hear from his lips.

     "Varney," he cried, "Varney, be calm! you will be listened to by one 
who
will draw no harsh -- no hasty conclusions; by one, who, with that charity, 
I
grieve to say, is rare, will place upon the words you utter the most
favourable construction.  Tell me all, I pray you, tell me all."

     "This is strange," said the vampyre.  "I never thought that aught human
could have moved me.  Young man, you have touched the chords of memory; they
vibrate throughout my heart, producing cadences and sounds of years long 
past.
Bear with me awhile."

     "And you will speak to me?"

     "I will."

     "Having your promise, then, I am content, Varney."

     "But you must be secret; not even in the wildest waste of nature, where
you can well presume that nought but Heaven can listen to your whispering,
must you utter one word of that which I shall tell to you."

     "Alas!" said Charles, "I dare not take such a confidence; I have said
that it is not for myself; I seek such knowledge of what you are, and what 
you
have been, but it is for another so dear to me, that all the charms of life
that make up other men's delights, equal not the witchery of one glance from
her, speaking as it does of the glorious light from that Heaven which is
eternal, from whence she sprung."

     "And you reject my communication," said Varney, "because I will not 
give
you leave to expose it to Flora Bannerworth."

     "It must be so."

     "And you are most anxious to hear that which I have to relate?"

     "Most anxious, indeed -- indeed, most anxious."

     "Then have I found in that scruple which besets your mind, a better
argument for trusting you, than had ye been loud in protestation.  Had your
promises of secrecy been but those which come from the lip, and not from the
heart, my confidence would not have been rejected on such grounds.  I think
that I dare trust you."

     "With leave to tell to Flora that which you shall communicate."

     "You may whisper it to her, but to no one else, without my special 
leave
and licence."

     "I agree to those terms, and will religiously preserve them."

     "I do not doubt you for one moment; and now I will tell to you what 
never
yet has passed my lips to mortal man.  Now will I connect together some
matters which you may have heard piecemeal from others."

     "What others are they?"

     "Dr. Chillingworth, and he who once officiated as a London hangman."

     "I have heard something from those quarters."

     "Listen then to me, and you shall better understand that which you have
heard.  Some years ago, it matters not the number, on a stormy night, 
towards
the autumn of the year, two men sat alone in poverty, and that species of
distress which beset the haughty, profligate, daring man, who has been
accustomed all his life to its most enticing enjoyments, but never to that
industry which alone ought to produce them, and render them great and
magnificent."

     "Two men; and who were they?"

     "I was one.  Look upon me!  I was one of those men; and strong and evil
passions were battling in my heart."

     "And the other?"

     "Was Marmaduke Bannerworth."

     "Gracious Heaven! the father of her whom I adore; the suicide."

     "Yes, the same; that man stained with a thousand vices -- blasted by a
thousand crimes -- the father of her who partakes nothing of his nature, who
borrows nothing from his memory but his name -- was the man who there sat 
with
me, plotting and contriving how, by fraud or violence, we were to lead our
usual life of revelry and wild audacious debauch."

     "Go on, go on; believe me, I am deeply interested."

     "I can see as much.  We were not nice in the various schemes which our
prolific fancies engendered.  If trickery, and the false dice at the gaming
table, sufficed not to fill our purses, we were bold enough for violence.  
If
simple robbery would not succeed, we could take a life."

     "Murder?"

     "Ay, call it by its proper name, a murder.  We sat till the midnight 
hour
had passed, without arriving at a definite conclusion; we saw no plan of
practicable operation, and so we wandered onwards to one of those deep dens 
of
iniquity, a gaming house, wherein we had won and lost thousands.

     "We had no money, but we staked largely, in the shape of a wager, upon
the success of one of the players; we knew not, or cared not, for the
consequences, if we had lost; but, as it happened, we were largely 
successful,
and beggars as we had walked into that place, we might have left it
independent men.

     "But when does the gambler know when to pause in his career?  If defeat
awakens all the raging passions of humanity within his bosom, success but
feeds the great vice that has been there engendered.  To the dawn of morn we
played; the bright sun shone in, and yet we played -- the midday came, and
went -- the stimulant of wine supported us, and still we played; then came 
the
shadows of evening, stealing on in all their beauty.  But what were they to
us, amid those mutations of fortune, which, at one moment, made us princes,
and placed palaces at our control, and, at another, debased us below the
veriest beggar, that craves the stinted alms of charity from door to door.

     "And there was one man who, from the first to the last, stayed by us 
like
a very fiend; more than man, I thought he was not human.  We won of all, but
of him.  People came and brought their bright red gold, and laid it down
before us, but for us to take it up, and then, by a cruel stroke of fortune,
he took it from us.

      "The night came on; we won, and he won of us; the clock struck twelve 
--
we were beggars.  God knows what was he.

     "We saw him place his winnings about his person -- we saw the smile 
that
curved the corners of his lips; he was calm, and we were maddened.  The 
blood
flowed temperately through his veins, but in ours it was burning lava,
scorching as it went through every petty artery, and drying up all human
thought -- all human feeling.

     "The winner left, and we tracked his footsteps.  When he reached the 
open
air, although he had taken much less than we of the intoxicating beverages
that are supplied gratis to those who frequent those haunts of infamy, it 
was
evident that some sort of inebriation attacked him; his steps were 
disordered
and unsteady, and, as we followed him, we could perceive, by the devious 
track
that he took, that he was somewhat uncertain of his route.

     "We had no fixed motive in so pursuing this man.  It was but an 
impulsive
proceeding at the best; but as he still went on and cleared the streets,
getting into the wild and open country, and among the hedge-rows, we began 
to
whisper together, and to think that what we did not owe to fortune, we might
to our own energy and courage at such a moment.

     "I need not hesitate to say so, since, to hide the most important 
feature
of my revelation from you, would be but to mock you; we resolved upon 
robbing
him."

     "And was that all?"

     "It was all that our resolution went to.  We were not anxious to spill
blood; but still we were resolved that we would accomplish our purpose, even
if it required murder for its consummation.  Have you heard enough?"

     "I have not heard enough, although I guess the rest."

     "You may well guess it, from its preface.  He turned down a lonely
pathway, which, had we chosen it ourselves, could not have been more 
suitable
for the attack we meditated.

     "There were tall trees on either side, and a hedge-row stretching high 
up
between them.  We knew that that lane led to a suburban village, which,
without a doubt, was the object of his destination.

     "Then Marmaduke Bannerworth spoke, saying, --

     "'What we have to do, must be done now or never.  There needs not two 
in
this adventure.  Shall you or I require him to refund what he has won from
us?'

     "'I care not,' I said; 'but if we are to accomplish our purpose without
arousing even a shadow of resistance, it is better to show him its futility 
by
both appearing, and take a share in the adventure.'

     "This was agreed upon, and we hastened forward.  He heard footsteps
pursuing him, and quickened his pace.  I was the fleetest runner, and 
overtook
him.  I passed him a pace or two, and then turning, I faced him, and impeded
his progress.

     "The lane was narrow, and a glance behind him showed him Marmaduke
Bannerworth; so that he was hemmed in between two enemies, and could move
neither to the right nor to the left on account of the thick brushwood that
intervened between the trees.

     "Then, with an amazing courage, that sat but ill upon him, he demanded 
of
us what we wanted, and proclaimed his right to pass, despite the obstruction
we placed in his way.

     "The dialogue was brief.  I, being foremost, spoke to him.

     "'Your money,' I said; 'your winnings at the gaming-table.  We cannot,
and we will not lose it.'

     "So suddenly, that he had nearly taken my life, he drew a pistol from 
his
pocket, and levelling it at my head, he fired upon me.

     "Perhaps, had I moved, it might have been my death; but, as it was, the
bullet furrowed my cheek, leaving a scar, the path of which is yet visible 
in
a white cicatrix.

     "I felt a stunning sensation, and thought myself a dead man.  I cried
aloud to Marmaduke Bannerworth, and he rushed forward.  I knew not that he 
was
armed, and that he had the power about him to do the deed which he then
accomplished; but there was a groan, a slight struggle, and the successful
gamester fell upon the green sward, bathed in his blood."

     "And this is the father of her whom I adore?"

     "It is.  Are you shocked to think of such a near relationship between 
so
much beauty and intelligence and a midnight murderer?  Is your philosophy so
poor, that the daughter's beauty suffers from the commission of a father's
crime?"

     "No, no, it is not so.  Do not fancy that, for one moment, I can
entertain such unworthy opinions.  The thought that crossed me was that I
should have to tell one of such a gentle nature that her father had done 
such
a deed."

     "On that head you can use your own discretion.  The deed was done; 
there
was sufficient light for us to look upon the features of the dying man.
Ghastly and terrific they glared upon us; while the glazed eyes, as they 
were
upturned to the bright sky, seemed appealing to Heaven for vengeance against
us, for having done the deed.

     "Many a day and many an hour since, at all those times and all seasons, 
I
have seen them, following me, and gloating over the misery they had the 
power
to make.  I think I see them now."

     "Indeed!"

     "Yes; look -- look -- see how they glare upon me -- with what a fixed 
and
frightful stare the bloodshot pupils keep their place -- there, there! oh!
save me from such a visitation again.  It is too horrible.  I dare not -- I
cannot endure it; and yet why do you gaze at me with such an aspect, dread
visitant?  You know that it was not my hand that did the deed -- who laid 
you
low.  You know that not to me are you able to lay the heavy charge of your
death!"

     "Varney, you look upon vacancy," said Charles Holland.

     "No, no; vacancy it may be to you, but to me 'tis full of horrible
shapes."

     "Compose yourself; you have taken me far into your confidence already; 
I
pray you now to tell me all.  I have in my brain no room for horrible
conjectures such as those which might else torment me."

     Varney was silent for a few minutes, and then he wiped from his brow 
the
heavy drops of perspiration that had there gathered, and heaved a deep sigh.

     "Speak to me," added Charles; "nothing will so much relieve you from 
the
terrors of this remembrance as making a confidence which reflection will
approve of, and which you will know that you have no reason to repent."

     "Charles Holland," said Varney, "I have already gone too far to retract
-- much too far, I know, and can well understand all the danger of half
confidence.  You already know so much, that it is fit you should know more."

     "Go on then, Varney, I will listen to you."

     "I know not if, at this juncture, I can command myself to say more.  I
feel that what next has to be told will be most horrible for me to tell --
most sad for you to hear told."

     "I can well believe, Varney, from your manner of speech, and from the
words you use, that you have some secret to relate beyond the simple fact of
the murder of this gamester by Marmaduke Bannerworth."

     "You are right -- such is the fact; the death of that man could not 
have
moved me as you now see me moved.  There is a secret connected with his fate
which I may well hesitate to utter -- a secret too horrible even to whisper 
to
the winds of heaven -- although I did not do the deed; no, no -- I did not
strike the blow -- not I -- not I!"

     "Varney, it is astonishing to me the pains you take to assure yourself 
of
your innocence of this deed; no one accuses you, but still, were it not that 
I
am impressed with a strong conviction that you're speaking to me nothing but
the truth, the very fact of your extreme anxiety to acquit yourself, would
engender suspicion."

     "I can understand that feeling, Charles Holland; I can fully understand
it.  I do not blame you for it -- it is a most natural one; but when you 
know
all, you will feel with me how necessary it must have been to my peace to
seize upon every trivial circumstance that can help me to a belief in my own
innocence."

     "It may be so; as yet, you well know, I speak in ignorance.  But what
could there have been in the character of that gambler, that has made you so
sympathetic concerning his decease?"

     "Nothing -- nothing whatever in his character.  He was a bad man; not 
one
of these free, open spirits which are seduced into crime by thoughtlessness 
--
not one of those whom we pity, perchance, more than we condemn; but a man
without a redeeming trait in his disposition -- a man so heaped up with 
vices
and iniquities, that society gained much by his decease, and not an 
individual
could say that he had lost a friend."

     "And yet the mere thought of the circumstances connected with his death
seems almost to drive you to the verge of despair."

     "You are right; the mere thought has that effect."

     "You have aroused all my curiosity to know the causes of such a 
feeling."

     Varney paced the apartment in silence for many minutes.  He seemed to 
be
enduring a great mental struggle, and at length, when he turned to Charles
Holland and spoke, there were upon his countenance traces of deep emotion.

     "I have said, young man, that I will take you into my confidence.  I 
have
said that I will clear up many seeming mysteries, and that I will enable you
to understand what was obscure in the narrative of Dr. Chillingworth, and of
that man who filled the office of public executioner, and who has haunted me
so long."

     "It is true, then, as the doctor states, that you were executed in
London?"

     "I was."

     "And resuscitated by the galvanic process, put into operation by Dr.
Chillingworth?"

     "As he supposed; but there are truths connected with natural philosophy
which he dreamed not of.  I bear a charmed life, and it was but accident 
which
produced a similar effect upon the latent springs of my existence in the 
house
to which the executioner conducted me, to what would have been produced had 
I
been suffered, in the free and open air, to wait until the cool moonbeams 
fell
upon me."

     "Varney, Varney," said Charles Holland, "you will not succeed in
convincing me of your supernatural powers.  I hold such feelings and
sensations at arm's length.  I will not -- I cannot assume you to be what 
you
affect."

     "I ask for no man's belief.  I know that which I know, and, gathering
experience from the coincidence of different phenomena, I am compelled to
arrive at certain conclusions.  Believe what you please, doubt what you
please; but I say again that I am not as other men."

     "I am in no condition to dispute your proposition; I wish not to 
dispute
it; but you are wandering, Varney, from the point.  I wait anxiously for a
continuation of your narrative."

     "I know that I am wandering from it -- I know well that I am wandering
from it, and that the reason I do so is that I dread that continuation."

     "That dread will not be the less for its postponement."

     "You are right; but tell me, Charles Holland, although you are young 
you
have been about in the great world sufficiently to form correct opinions, 
and
to understand that which is related to you, drawing proper deductions from
certain facts, and arriving possibly at more correct conclusions than some 
of
maturer years with less wisdom."

     "I will freely answer, Varney, any question you may put to me."

     "I know it; tell me then what measure of guilt you attach to me in the
transaction I have noticed to you."

     "It seems then to me that, not contemplating the man's murder, you 
cannot
be accused of the act, although a set of fortuitous circumstances made you
appear an accomplice to its commission."

     "You think I may be acquitted?"

     "You can acquit yourself, knowing that you did not contemplate the
murder."

     "I did not contemplate it.  I know not what desperate deed I should 
have
stopped short at then, in the height of my distress, but I neither
contemplated taking that man's life, nor did I strike the blow which sent 
him
from existence."

     "There is even some excuse as regards the higher crime for Marmaduke
Bannerworth."

     "Think you so?"

     "Yes; he thought that you were killed, and impulsively he might have
struck the blow that made him a murderer."

     "Be it so.  I am willing, extremely willing that anything should occur
that should remove the odium of guilt from any man.  Be it so, I say, with 
all
my heart; but now, Charles Holland, I feel that we must meet again ere I can
tell you all; but in the meantime let Flora Bannerworth rest in peace -- she
need dread nothing from me.  Avarice and revenge, the two passions which 
found
a home in my heart, are now stifled forever."

     "Revenge! did you say revenge?"

     "I did; whence the marvel, am I not sufficiently human for that?"

     "But you coupled it with the name of Flora Bannerworth."

     "I did, and that is part of my mystery."

     "A mystery, indeed, to imagine that such a being as Flora could awaken
any such feeling in your heart -- a most abundant mystery."

     "It is so.  I do not affect to deny it; but yet it is true, although so
greatly mysterious; but tell her that although at one time I looked upon her
as one whom I cared not if I injured, her beauty and distress changed the
current of my thoughts, and won me greatly.  From the moment I found I had 
the
power to become the bane of her existence, I ceased to wish to be so, and
never again shall she experience a pang of alarm from Varney, the vampyre."

     "Your message shall be faithfully delivered, and doubt not that it will
be received with grateful feelings.  Nevertheless I should have much wished 
to
have been in a position to inform her of more particulars."

     "Come to me here at midnight to-morrow, and you shall know all.  I will
have no reservation with you, no concealments; you shall know whom I have 
had
to battle against, and how it is that a world of evil passions took 
possession
of my heart and made me what I am."

     "Are you firm in this determination, Varney -- will you indeed tell me 
no
more to-night?"

     "No more, I have said it.  Leave me now, I have need of more repose; 
for
of late sleep has seldom closed my eyelids."

     Charles Holland was convinced, from the positive manner in which he
spoke, that nothing more in the shape of information, at that time, was to 
be
expected from Varney; and being fearful that if he urged this strange being
too far, at a time when he did not wish it, he might refuse all further
communication, he thought it prudent to leave him, so he said to him, --

     "Be assured, Varney, I shall keep the appointment you have made, with 
an
expectation when we do meet of being rewarded by a recital of some full
particulars."

     "You shall not be disappointed; farewell, farewell!"

     Charles Holland bade him adieu, and left the place.

     Although he had now acquired all the information he hoped to take away
with him when Varney first began to be communicative, yet, when he came to
consider how strange and unaccountable a being he had been in communication
with, Charles could not but congratulate himself that he had heard so much;
for, from the manner of Varney, he could well suppose that that was, indeed,
the first time he had been so communicative upon subjects which evidently 
held
so conspicuous a place in his heart.

     And he had abundance of hope, likewise, from what had been said by
Varney, that he would keep his word, and communicate to him fully all else
that he required to know and when he recollected those words which Varney 
had
used, signifying that he knew the danger of half confidences, that hope grew
into a certainty, and Charles began to have no doubt but that on the next
evening all that was mysterious in the various affairs connected with the
vampyre would become clear and open to the light of day.

     He strolled down the lane in which the lone house was situated, 
revolving
these matters in his mine, and when he arrived at its entrance, he was 
rather
surprised to see a throng of persons hastily moving onward, with some
appearance of dismay about them, and anxiety depicted upon their 
countenances.

     He stopped a lad, and inquired of him the cause of the seeming tumult.

     "Why, sir, the fact is," said the boy, "a crowd from the town's been
burning down Bannerworth Hall, and they've killed a man."

     "Bannerworth Hall! you must be mistaken."

     "Well, sir, I ought not to call it Bannerworth Hall, because I mean the
old ruins in the neighbourhood that are supposed to have been originally
Bannerworth Hall before the house now called such was built; and, moreover, 
as
the Bannerworths have always had a garden there, and two or three old sheds,
the people in the town called it Bannerworth Hall in common with the other
building."

     "I understand.  And do you say that all have been destroyed?"

     "Yes, sir.  All that was capable of being burnt has been burnt, and, 
what
is more, a man has been killed among the ruins.  We don't know who he is, 
but
the folks said he was a vampyre, and they left him for dead."

     "When will these terrible outrages cease?  Oh! Varney, Varney, you have
much to answer for; even if in your conscience you succeed in acquitting
yourself of the murder, some of the particulars concerning which you have
informed me of."

 Next Time: The Mysterious Arrival at the Inn. -- The Hungarian Nobleman. --
 The Letter to Varney.




                              Chapter LXXXIII.

THE MYSTERIOUS ARRIVAL AT THE INN. -- THE HUNGARIAN NOBLEMAN. -- THE LETTER 
TO
VARNEY.


     While these affairs are proceeding, and when there seems every 
appearance
of Sir Francis Varney himself quickly putting an end to some of the 
vexatious
circumstances connected with himself and the Bannerworth family, it is
necessary that we should notice an occurrence which took place at the same 
inn
which the admiral had made such a scene of confusion upon the occasion of 
his
first arrival in the town.

     Not since the admiral had arrived with Jack Pringle, and so disturbed 
the
whole economy of the household, was there so much curiosity excited as on 
the
morning following the interview which Charles Holland had had with Varney, 
the
vampyre.

     The inn was scarcely opened, when a stranger arrived, mounted on a 
coal-
black horse, and, alighting, he surrendered the bridle into the hands of a 
boy
who happened to be at the inn-door, and stalked slowly and solemnly into the
building.

     He was tall, and of a cadaverous aspect; in attire he was plainly
apparelled, but there was no appearance of poverty about him; on the 
contrary,
what he really had on was of a rich and costly character, although destitute
of ornament.

     He sat down in the first room that presented itself, and awaited the
appearance of the landlord, who, upon being informed that a guest of
apparently ample means, and of some consequence, had entered the place,
hastily went to him to receive his commands.

     With a profusion of bows, our old friend, who had been so obsequious to
Admiral Bell, entered the room, and begged to know what orders the gentleman
had for him.

     "I presume," said the stranger, in a deep, solemn voice, "I presume 
that
you have no objection, for a few days that I shall remain in this town, to
board and lodge me for a certain price which you can name to me at once?"

     "Certainly, sir," said the landlord; "any way you please; without wine,
sir, I presume?"

     "As you please; make your own arrangements."

     "Well, sir, as we can't tell, of course, what wine a gentleman may 
drink,
but when we come to consider breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper, and a bed,
and all that sort of thing, and a private sitting-room, I suppose, sir?"

     "Certainly."

     "You would not, then, think, sir, a matter of four guineas a week will 
be
too much, perhaps."

     "I told you to name your own charge.  Let it be four guineas; if you 
had
said eight I should have paid it."

     "Good God!" said the publican, "here's a damned fool that I am.  I beg
your pardon, sir, I didn't mean you.  Now I could punch my own head -- will
you have breakfast at once, sir, and then we shall begin regularly, you 
know,
sir?"

     "Have what?"

     "Breakfast, breakfast, you know, sir; tea, coffee, cocoa, or chocolate;
ham, eggs, or a bit of grilled fowl, cold sirloin of roast beef, or a red
herring -- anything you like, sir."

     "I never take breakfast, so you may spare yourself the trouble of
providing anything for me."

     "Not take breakfast, sir! not take breakfast!  Would you like to take
anything to drink then, sir?  People say it's an odd time, at eight o'clock 
in
the morning, to drink; but, for my part, I always have thought that you
couldn't begin a good thing too soon."

     "I live upon drink," said the stranger; "but you have none in the 
cellar
that will suit me."

     "Indeed, sir."

     "No, no, I am certain."

     "Why, we've got some claret now, sir," said the landlord.

     "Which may look like blood, and yet not be it."

     "Like what, sir? -- damn my rags!"

     "Begone, begone."

     The stranger uttered these words so peremptorily that the landlord
hastily left the room, and going into his own bar, he gave himself so small 
a
tap on the side of the head, that it would not have hurt a fly, as he said, 
--

     "I could punch myself into bits, I could tear my hair out by the 
roots;"
and then he pulled a little bit of his hair, so gently and tenderly that it
showed what a man of discretion he was, even in the worst of all his agony 
of
passion.

     "The idea," he added, "of a fellow coming here, paying four guineas a
week for board and lodging, telling me he would not have minded eight, and
then not wanting any breakfast; it's enough to aggravate half a dozen 
saints;
but what an odd fish he looks."

     At this moment the ostler came in, and, standing at the bar, he wiped 
his
mouth with his sleeve, as he said, --

     "I suppose you'll stand a quart for that, master?"

     "A quart for what, you vagabond?  A quart because I've done myself up 
in
heaps; a quart because I'm fit to pull myself into fiddlestrings?"

     "No," said the ostler; "because I've just put up the gentleman's 
horse."

     "What gentleman's horse?"

     "Why, the big-looking fellow with the white face, now in the parlour."

     "What, did he come on a horse, Sam?  What sort of a looking creature is
it? you may judge of a man from the sort of horse-company he keeps."

     "Well, then, sir, I hardly know.  It's coal black, and looks as knowing
as possible; it's tried twice to get a kick at me, but I was down upon him,
and put the bucket in his way. Howsomdever, I don't think it's a bad animal,
as a animal, mind you, sir, though a little bit wicious or so."

     "Well," said the publican, as he drew the ostler half a pint instead of 
a
quart, "you're always drinking; take that."

     "Blow me," said the ostler, "half a pint, master!"

     "Plague take you, I can't stand parleying with you, there's the parlour
bell; perhaps after all, he will have some breakfast."

     While the landlord was away the ostler helped himself to a quart of the
strongest ale, which, by a singular faculty that he had acquired, he poured
down his throat without any effort at swallowing, holding his head back, and
the jug at a little distance from his mouth.

     Having accomplished this feat, he reversed the jug, giving it a knowing
tap with his knuckles as though he would have signified to all the world 
that
it was empty, and that he had accomplished what he desired.

     In the meantime, the landlord had made his way to his strange guest, 
who
said to him, when he came into the room,

     "Is there not one Sir Francis Varney residing in this town?"

     "The devil!" thought the landlord; "this is another of them, I'll bet a
guinea.  Sir Francis Varney, sir, did you say? Why, sir, there was a Sir
Francis Varney, but folks seem to think as how he's no better than he should
be -- a sort of vampyre, sir, if you know what that is."

     "I have, certainly, heard of such things; but can you not tell me
Varney's address?  I wish to see him."

     "Well, then, sir, I cannot tell it to you, for there's really been such 
a
commotion and such a riot about him that he's taken himself off, I think,
altogether, and we can hear nothing of him.  Lord bless you, sir, they burnt
down his house, and hunted him about so, that I don't think that he'll ever
show his face here again."

     "And cannot you tell me where he was seen last?"

     "That I cannot, sir; but, if anybody knows anything about him, it's Mr.
Henry Bannerworth, or perhaps Dr. Chillingworth, for they have had more to 
do
with him than anybody else."

     "Indeed; and can you tell me the address of the former individual?"

     "That I cannot, sir, for the Bannerworths have left the Hall.  As for 
the
doctor, sir, you'll see his house in High-street, with a large brass plate 
on
the door, so that you cannot mistake it.  It's No. 9, on the other side of 
the
way."

     "I thank you for so much information," said the stranger, and rising, 
he
walked to the door.  Before, however, he left, he turned, and added, -- "You
can say, if you should by chance meet Mr. Bannerworth, that a Hungarian
nobleman wishes to speak to him concerning Sir Francis Varney, the vampyre?"

     "A what, sir?"

     "A nobleman from Hungary," was the reply.

     "The deuce!" said the landlord, as he looked after him. "He don't seem 
at
all hungry here, not thirsty neither.  What does he mean by a nobleman from
Hungary?  The idea of a man talking about hungry, and not taking any
breakfast.  He's queering me.  I'll be hanged if I'll stand it.  Here I
clearly lose four guineas a week, and then get made a game of besides. A
nobleman, indeed!  I think I see him.  Why, he isn't quite so big as old
Slaney, the butcher.  It's a do.  I'll have at him when he comes back."

     Meanwhile, the unconscious object of this soliloquy passed down High-
street, until he came to Dr. Chillingworth's, at whose door he knocked.

     Now Mrs. Chillingworth had been waiting the whole night for the return 
of
the doctor, who had not yet made his appearance, and, consequently, that
lady's temper had become acidulated to an uncommon extent, and when she 
heard
a knock at the door, something possessed her that it could be no other than
her spouse, and she prepared to give him that warm reception which she
considered he had a right, as a married man, to expect after such conduct.

     She hurriedly filled a tolerably sized hand-basin with not the cleanest
water in the world, and then, opening the door hurriedly with one hand, she
slouced the contents into the face of the intruder, exclaiming, --

     "Now you've caught it!"

     "D--n!" said the Hungarian nobleman, and then Mrs. Chillingworth 
uttered
a scream, for she feared she had made a mistake.

     "Oh, sir!  I'm very sorry; but I thought it was my husband."

     But if you did," said the stranger, "there was no occasion to drown him
with a basin of soap-suds.  It is your husband I want, madam, if he be Dr.
Chillingworth."

     "Then, indeed, you must go on wanting him, sir, for he's not been to 
his
own home for a day and a night.  He takes up all his time in hunting after
that beastly vampyre."

     "Ah! Sir Francis Varney, you mean."

     "I do; and I'd Varney him if I caught hold of him."

     "Can you give me the least idea of where he can be found?"

     "Of course I can."

     "Indeed! where?" said the stranger, eagerly.

     "In some churchyard, to be sure, gobbling up the dead bodies."

     With this Mrs. Chillingworth shut the door with a bang that nearly
flattened the Hungarian's nose with his face, and he was fain to walk away,
quite convinced that there was no information to be had in that quarter.

     He returned to the inn, and having told the landlord that he would give 
a
handsome reward to any one who would discover to him the retreat of Sir
Francis Varney, he shut himself up in an apartment alone, and was busy for a
time in writing letters.

     Although the sum which the the stranger offered was an indefinite one,
the landlord mentioned the matter across the bar to several persons; but all
of them shook their heads, believing it to be a very perilous adventure 
indeed
to have anything to do with so troublesome a subject as Sir Francis Varney. 
As the day advanced, however, a young lad presented himself, and asked to 
see
the gentleman who had been inquiring for Varney.

     The landlord severely questioned and cross-questioned him, with the 
hope
of discovering if he had any information; but the boy was quite obdurate, 
and
would speak to no one but the person who had offered the reward, so that 
mine
host was compelled to take him to the Hungarian nobleman, who, as yet, had
neither eaten nor drunk in the house.

     The boy wore upon his countenance the very expression of juvenile
cunning, and when the stranger asked him if he really was in possession of 
any
information concerning the retreat of Sir Francis Varney, he said, --

     "I can tell you where he is, but what are you going to give?"

     "What sum do you require?" said the stranger.

     "A whole half-crown."

     "It is your's; and, if your information prove correct, come to-morrow,
and I'll add another to it, always provided, likewise, you keep the secret
from any one else."

     "Trust me for that," said the boy.  "I live with my grandmother; she's
precious old, and has got a cottage.  We sell milk and cakes, sticky stuff,
and pennywinkles."

     "A goodly collection.  Go on."

     "Well, sir, this morning, there comes a man in with a bottle, and he 
buys
a bottle full of milk and a loaf.  I saw him, and I knew it was Varney, the
vampyre."

     "You followed him?"

     "Of course I did, sir; and he's staying at the house that's to let down
the lane, round the corner, by Mr. Biggs's, and past Lee's garden, leaving 
old
Slaney's stacks on your right hand, and so cutting on till you come to 
Grant's
meadow, when you'll see old Madhunter's brick-field staring of you in the
face; and arter that -- "

     "Peace -- peace! -- you shall yourself conduct me.  Come to this place 
at
sunset; be secret, and, probably, ten times the reward you have already
received may be yours," said the stranger.

     "What, ten half-crowns?"

     "Yes; I will keep my word with you."

     "What a go!  I know what I'll do.  I'll set up as a showman, and what a
glorious treat it will be, to peep through one of the holes all day myself,
and get somebody to pull the strings up and down, and when I'm tired of 
that,
I can blaze away upon the trumpet like one o'clock.  I think I see me.  Here
you sees the Duke of Marlborough a whopping of everybody, and here you see 
the
Frenchmen flying about like parched peas in a sifter."

Next Time: The Excited Populace. -- Varney Hunted. -- The Place of Refuge.




                              Chapter LXXXIV.

THE EXCITED POPULACE. -- THE PLACE OF REFUGE.


     There seemed now a complete lull in the proceedings as connected with
Varney, the vampyre.  We have reason to believe that the executioner who had
been as solicitous as Varney to obtain undisputed possession of Bannerworth
Hall, has fallen a victim to the indiscriminate rage of the mob.  Varney
himself is a fugitive, and bound by the most solemn ties to Charles Holland,
not only to communicate to him such particulars of the past, as will bring
satisfaction to his mind, but to abstain from any act which, for the future,
shall exercise a disastrous influence upon the happiness of Flora.

     The doctor and the admiral, with Henry, had betaken themselves from the
Hall as we had recorded, and, in due time, reached the cottage where Flora 
and
her mother had found a temporary refuge.

     Mrs. Bannerworth was up; but Flora was sleeping, and, although the
tidings they had to tell were of a curious and mixed nature, they would not
have her disturbed to listen to them.

     And, likewise, they were rather pleased than otherwise, since they knew
not exactly what had become of Charles Holland, to think that they would
probably be spared the necessity of saying they could not account for his
absence.

     That he had gone upon some expedition, probably dangerous, and so one
which he did not wish to communicate the particulars of to his friends, lest
they should make a strong attempt to dissuade him from it, they were induced
to believe.

     But yet they had that confidence in his courage and active intellectual
resources, to believe that he would come through it unscathed, and, 
probably,
shortly show himself at the cottage.

     In this hope they were not disappointed, for in about two hours Charles
made his appearance; but, until he began to be questioned concerning his
absence by the admiral, he scarcely considered the kind of dilemma he had 
put
himself into by the promise of secrecy he had given to Varney, and was a
little puzzled to think how much he might tell, and how much he was bound in
honour to conceal.

     "Avast there!" cried the admiral; "what's become of your tongue, 
Charles?
You've been on some cruize, I'll be bound. Haul over the ship's books, and
tell us what's happened."

     "I have been upon an adventure," said Charles, "which I hope will be
productive of beneficial results to us all; but, the fact is, I have made a
promise, perhaps incautiously, that I will not communicate what I know."

     "Whew!" said the admiral; "that's awkward; but, however, if a man sails
under sealed instructions, there's an end of it. I remember when I was off
Candia once -- "

     "Ha!" interposed Jack, "that was the time you tumbled over the blessed
binnacle, all in consequence of taking too much Madiera.  I remember it, too
-- it's an out and out good story, that 'ere.  You took a rope's end, you
know, and laid into the bowsprit; and, says you, 'Get up, you lubber,' says
you, all the while a thinking, I suppose, as it was long Jack Ingram, the
carpenter's mate, laying asleep.  What a lark!"

     "This scoundrel will be the death of me," said the admiral; "there 
isn't
one word of truth in what he says.  I never got drunk in all my life, as
everybody knows.  Jack, affairs are getting serious between you and I -- we
must part, and for good. It's a good many times that I've told you you've
forgot the difference between the quarter-deck and the caboose.  Now, I'm
serious -- you're off the ship's books, and there's an end of you."

     "Very good," said Jack; "I'm willing.  I'll leave you.  Do you think I
want to keep you any longer?  Good by, old bloak -- I'll leave you to 
repent,
and when old grim death comes yard-arm with you, and you can't shake off his
boarding-tackle, you'll say, 'Where's Jack Pringle?' says you; and then 
what's
his name -- oh, ah! echo you call it -- echo'll say, it's d----d if it 
knows."

     Jack turned upon his heel, and before the admiral could make any reply,
he left the place.

     "What's the rascal up to now?" said the admiral.  "I really didn't 
think
he'd have taken me at my word."

     "Oh, then, after all, you didn't mean it, uncle?" said Charles.

     "What's that to you, you lubber, whether I mean it, or not, you shore-
going squab?  Of course I expect everybody to desert an old hulk, rats and 
all
-- and now Jack Pringle's gone; the vagabond, couldn't he stay? and get 
drunk
as long as he liked! Didn't he say what he pleased, and do what he pleased,
the mutinous thief?  Didn't he say I run away from a Frenchman off Cape
Ushant, and didn't I put up with that?"

     "But, my dear uncle, you sent him away yourself."

     "I didn't, and you know I didn't; but I see how it is, you've disgusted
Jack among you.  A better seaman never trod the deck of a man-of-war."

     "But his drunkenness, uncle?"

     "It's a lie.  I don't believe he ever got drunk.  I believe you all
invented it, and Jack's so good-natured, he tumbled about just to keep you 
in
countenance."

     "But his insolence, uncle; his gross insolence towards you -- his
inventions, his exaggerations of the truth?"

     "Avast, there -- avast, there, -- none of that, Master Charlie; Jack
couldn't do anything of the sort; and I means to say this, that if Jack was
here now, I'd stick up for him, and say he was a good seaman."

     "Tip us your fin, then," said Jack, darting into the room; "do you 
think
I'd leave you, you d----d old fool?  What would become of you, I wonder, if 
I
wasn't to take you in to dry nurse?  Why, you blessed old babby, what do you
mean by it?"

     "Jack, you villain!"

     "Ah! go on and call me a villain as much as you like. Don't you 
remember
when the bullets were scuttling our nobs?"

     "I do, I do, Jack; tip us your fin, old fellow.  You've saved my life
more than once."

     "It's a lie."

     "It ain't.  You did, I say."

     "You be d----d!"

     And thus was the most serious misunderstanding that these two worthies
ever had together made up.  The real fact is, that the admiral could as 
little
do without Jack, as he could have done without food; and as for Pringle, he 
no
more thought of leaving the old commodore, than  of -- what shall we say?
forswearing rum.  Jack himself could not have taken a stronger oath.

     But the old admiral had suffered so much from the idea that Jack had
actually left him, that although he abused him as usual often enough, he 
never
again talked of taking him off the ship's books; and, to the credit of Jack 
be
it spoken, he took no advantage of the circumstance, and only got drunk just
as usual, and called his master an old fool whenever it suited him.

 Next Time: The Hungarian Nobleman Gets Into Danger. -- He Is Fired At, And
 Shows Some of His Quality.




                               Chapter LXXXV.

THE HUNGARIAN NOBLEMAN GETS INTO DANGER. -- HE IS FIRED AT, AND SHOWS SOME 
OF
HIS QUALITY.


     Considerably delighted was the Hungarian, not only at the news he had
received from the boy, but as well for the cheapness of it.  Probably he did
not conceive it possible that the secret of the retreat of such a man as
Varney could have been attained so easily.

     He waited with great impatience for the evening, and stirred not from 
the
inn for several hours; neither did he take any refreshment, notwithstanding 
he
had made so liberal an arrangement with the landlord to be supplied.

     All this was a matter of great excitement and speculation in the inn, 
so
much so, indeed, that the landlord sent for some of the oldest customers of
his house, regular topers, who sat there every evening, indulging in strong
drinks, and pipes and tobacco, to ask their serious advice as to what he
should do, as if it were necessary he should do anything at all.

     But, somehow or another, these wiseacres who assembled at the 
landlord's
bidding, and sat down, with something strong before them, in the bar 
parlour,
never once seemed to think that a man might, if he choosed, come to an inn,
and agree to pay four guineas a week for board and lodging, and yet take
nothing at all.

     No; they could not understand it, and therefore they would not have it. 
It was quite monstrous that anybody should attempt to do anything so
completely out of the ordinary course of proceeding.  It was not to be 
borne;
and as in this country it happens, free and enlightened as we are, that no 
man
can commit a greater social offence than doing something his neighbours 
never
thought of doing themselves, the Hungarian nobleman was voted a most 
dangerous
character, and, in fact, not to be put up with.

     "I shouldn't have thought so much of it," said the landlord; "but only
look at the aggravation of the thing.  After I have asked him four guineas a
week, and expected to be beaten down to two, to be then told that he would 
not
have cared if it had been eight.  It is enough to aggravate a saint."

     "Well, I agree with you there," said another; "that's just what it is,
and I only wonder that a man of your sagacity has not quite understood it
before."

     "Understood what?"

     "Why, that he is a vampyre.  He has heard of Sir Francis Varney, that's
the fact, and he's come to see him.  Birds of a feather, you know, flock
together, and now we shall have two vampyres in the town instead of one."

     The party looked rather blank at this suggestion, which, indeed, seemed
rather uncomfortable probably.  The landlord had just opened his mouth to 
make
some remark, when he was stopped by the violent ringing of what he now 
called
the vampyre's bell, since it proceeded from the room where the Hungarian
nobleman was.

     "Have you an almanack in the house?" was the question of the mysterious
guest.

     "An almanack, sir? well, I really don't know.  Let me see, an 
almanack."

     "But, perhaps, you can tell me.  I was to know the moon's age."

     "The devil!" thought the landlord; "he's a vampyre, and no mistake.  
Why,
sir, as to the moon's age, it was a full moon last night; very bright and
beautiful, only you could not see it for the clouds."

     "A full moon last night," said the mysterious guest, thoughtfully; "it
may shine, then, brightly to-night, and if so, all will be well.  I thank 
you,
-- leave the room."

     "Do you mean to say, sir, you don't want anything to eat now?"

     "What I want I will order."

     "But you have ordered nothing."

     "Then presume that I want nothing."

     The discomfited landlord was obliged to leave the room, for there was 
no
such  thing as making any answer to this, and so, still further confirmed in
his opinion that the stranger was a vampyre that came to see Sir Francis
Varney from a sympathetic feeling towards him, he again reached the bar-
parlour.

     "You may depend," he said, "as sure as eggs is eggs, that he is a
vampyre.  Hilloa! he's gone off, -- after him -- after him; he thinks we
suspect him.  There he goes -- down the High-street."

     The landlord ran out, and so did those who were with him, one of whom
carried his brandy and water in his hand, which, being too hot for him to
swallow all at once, he still could not think of leaving behind.

     It was now getting rapidly dark, and the mysterious stranger was 
actually
proceeding towards the lane to keep his appointment with the boy who had
promised to conduct him to the hiding-place of Sir Francis Varney.

     He had not proceeded far, however, before he began to suspect that he 
was
followed, as it was evident on the instant that he altered his course; for,
instead of walking down the lane, where the boy was waiting for him, he went
right on, and seemed desirous of making his way into the open country 
between
the town and Bannerworth Hall.

     His pursuers -- for they assumed that character -- when they saw this
became anxious to intercept him; and thinking that the greater force they 
had
the better, they called out aloud as they passed a smithy, where a man was
shoeing a horse, --

     "Jack Burdon, here is another vampyre!"

     "The deuce there is!" said the person who was addressed. "I'll soon
settle him.  Here's my wife gets no sleep of a night as it is, all owing to
that Varney, who has been plaguing us so long.  I won't put up with 
another."

     So saying, he snatched from a hook on which it hung, an old fowling-
piece, and joined the pursuit, which now required to be conducted with some
celerity, for the stranger had struck into the open country, and was getting
on at a good speed.

     The last remnants of the twilight were fading away, and although the 
moon
had actually risen, its rays were obscured by a number of light, fleecy
clouds, which, although they did not promise to be of long continuance, as 
yet
certainly impeded the light.

     "Where is he going?" said the blacksmith.  "He seems to be making his 
way
towards the mill-stream."

     "No," said another; "don't you see he is striking higher up towards the
old ford, where the stepping-stones are?"

     "He is -- he is," cried the blacksmith, "Run on -- run on; don't you 
see
he is crossing it now?  Tell me, all of you, are you quite sure he is a
vampyre, and no mistake?  He ain't the exciseman, landlord, now, is he?"

     "The exciseman, the devil!  Do you think I want to shoot the 
exciseman?"

     "Very good -- then here goes," exclaimed the Smith.

     He stopped, and just as the brisk night air blew aside the clouds from
before the face of the moon, and as the stranger was crossing the slippery
stones, he fired at him.

                                *   *   *   *

     How silently and sweetly the moon's rays fall upon the water, upon the
meadows, and upon the woods.  The scenery appeared the work of enchantment,
some fairy land, waiting the appearance of its inhabitants.  No sound met 
the
ear; the very wind was hushed; nothing was there to distract the sense of
sight, save the power of reflection.

     This, indeed, would aid the effect of such a scene.  A cloudless sky, 
the
stars all radiant with beauty, while the moon, rising higher and higher in 
the
heavens, increasing in the strength and refulgence of her light, and dimming
the very stars, which seemed to grow gradually invisible as the majesty of 
the
queen of night became more and more manifest.

     The dark woods and the open meadows contrasted more and more strongly;
like light and shade, the earth and sky were not more distinct and apart; 
and
the rippling stream, that rushed along with all the impetuosity of uneven
ground.

     The banks are clothed with verdure; the tall sedges, here and there,
lined the sides; beds of bulrushes raised their heads high above all else, 
and
threw out their round clumps of blossoms like tufts, and looked strange in 
the
light of the moon.

     Here and there, too, the willows bent gracefully over the stream, and
their long leaves were wafted and borne up and down by the gentler force of
the stream.

     Below, the stream widened, and ran foaming over a hard, stony bottom, 
and
near the middle is a heap of stones -- of large stones, that form the bed of
the river, from which the water has washed away all earthy particles, and 
left
them by themselves.

     These stones in winter could not be seen, they were all under water, 
and
the stream washed over in a turbulent and tumultuous manner.  But now, when
the water was clear and low, they are many of them positively out of the
water, the stream running around and through their interstices; the water-
weeds here and there lying at the top of the stream, and blossoming
beautifully.

     The daisy-like blossoms danced and waved gently on the moving flood, at
the same time they shone in the moonlight, like fairy faces rising from the
depths of the river, to receive the principle of life from the moon's rays.

     'Tis sweet to wander in the moonlight at such an hour, and it is sweet 
to
look upon such a scene with an unruffled mind, and to give way to the 
feelings
that are engendered by a walk by the river side.

     See, the moon is rising higher and higher, the shadows grow shorter and
shorter; the river, which in places was altogether hidden by the tall willow
trees, now gradually becomes less and less hidden, and the water becomes 
more
and more lit up.

     The moonbeams play gracefully on the rippling surface, here and there
appearing like liquid silver, that each instant changed its position and
surface exposed to the light.

     Such a moment -- such a scene, were by far too well calculated to cause
the most solemn and serious emotions of the mind, and he must have been but 
at
best insensible, who could wander over meadow and through grove, and yet
remain untouched by the scene of poetry and romance in which he breathed and
moved.

     At such a time, and in such a place, the world is alive with all the
finer essences of mysterious life.  'Tis at such an hour that the spirits 
quit
their secret abodes, and visit the earth, and whirl round the enchanted 
trees.

     'Tis now the spirits of earth and air dance their giddy flight from
flower to flower.  'Tis now they collect and exchange their greetings; the
wood is filled with them, the meadows teem with them, the hedges at the 
river
side have them hidden among the deep green leaves and blades.

     But what is that yonder, on the stones, partially out of the water --
what can it be?

     The more it is looked at, the more it resembles the human form -- and 
yet
it is still and motionless on the hard stones -- and yet it is a human form. 
The legs are lying in the water, the arms appear to be partially in and
partially out, they seem moved by the stream now and then, but very gently -
-
so slightly, indeed, that it might well be questioned if it moved at all.

     The moon's rays had not reached it; the bank on the opposite side of 
the
stream was high, and some tall trees rose up and obscured the moon.  But she
was rising higher and higher each moment, and, finally, when it has reached
the tops of those trees, then the rays will reach the middle of the river, 
and
then, by degrees, it will reach the stones in the river, and, finally, the
body that lies there so still and so mysteriously.

     How it came there it would be difficult to say.  It appeared as though,
when the waters were high, the body had floated down, and, at the subsidence
of the waters, it had been left upon the stones, and now it was exposed to
view.

     It was strange and mysterious, and those who might look upon such a 
sight
would feel their blood chill, and their body creep, to contemplate the 
remains
of humanity in such a place, and in such a condition as that must be in.

     A human life had been taken!  How?  Who could tell?  Perhaps accident
alone was the cause of it; perhaps some one had taken a life by violent 
means,
and thrown the body in the waters to conceal the fact and the crime.

     The waters had brought it down, and deposited it there in the middle of
the river, without any human creature being acquainted with the fact.

     But the moon rises -- the beams come trembling through the tree tops 
and
straggling branches, and fall upon the opposite bank, and there lies the 
body,
midstream, and in comparative darkness.

     By the time the river is lit up by the moon's rays, then the object on
the stones will be visible, then it can be ascertained what appears now only
probable, namely, is the dark object a human form or not?

     In the absence of light it appears to be so, but when the flood of 
silver
light falls upon it, it would be placed then beyond a doubt.

     The time is approaching -- the moon each moment approaches her 
meridian,
and each moment do the rays increase in number and in strength, while the
shadows shorten.

     The opposite bank each moment becomes more and more distinct, and the
side of the stream, the green rushes and sedges, all by degrees come full 
into
view.

     Now and then a fish leaps out of the stream, and just exhibits itself, 
as
much as to say, "There are things living in the stream, and I am one of 
them."

     The moment is one of awe -- the presence of that mysterious and 
dreadful-
looking object, even while its identity remains doubt, chills the heart -- 
it
contracts the expanding thoughts to that one object -- all interest in the
scene lies centered in that one point.

     What could it be?  What else but a human body?  What else could assume
such a form?  But see, nearly half the stream is lit by the moonbeams
struggling through the tree tops, and now rising above them.  The light
increases, and the shadows shorten.

     The edge of the bed of stones now becomes lit up by the moonlight; the
rippling stream, the bubbles, and the tiny spray that was caused  by the 
rush
of water against the stones, seemed like sparkling flashes of silver fire.

     Then came the moonbeams upon the body, for it was raised above the 
level
of the water, and shewed conspicuously; of the moonbeams reached the body
before they fell on the surrounding water; for that reason then it was the
body presented a strange and ghastly object against a deep, dark background,
by which it was surrounded.

     But this did not last long -- the water in another minute was lit up by
the moon's pale beams, and then indeed could be plainly enough seen the body
of a man lying on the heap of stones motionless and ghastly.

     The colourless hue of the moonlight gave the object a most horrific and
terrible appearance!  The face of the dead man was turned towards the moon's
rays, and the body seemed to receive all the light that could fall upon it.

     It was a terrible object to look upon, and one that added a new and
singular interest to the scene!  The world seemed then to be composed almost
exclusively of still life, and the body was no impediment to the stillness 
of
the scene.

     It was, all else considered, a calm, beautiful scene, lovely the night,
gorgeous the silvery rays that lit up the face of nature; the hill and dale,
meadow, and wood, and river, all afforded contrasts strong, striking, and
strange.

     But strange, and more strange than any contrast in nature, was that
afforded to the calm beauty o the night and placed by the deep stillness and
quietude imposed upon the mind by that motionless human body.

     The moon's rays now fell upon its full length; the feet were lying in 
the
water, the head lay back, with its features turned towards the quarter of 
the
heavens where the moon shone from; the hair floated on the shallow water,
while the face and body were exposed to all influences, from its raised and
prominent position.

     The moonbeams had scarcely settled upon it -- scarce a few minutes --
when the body moved.  Was it the water that moved it? it could not be, 
surely,
that the moonbeams had the power of recalling life into that inanimate mass,
that lay there for some time still and motionless as the very stones on 
which
it lay.

     It was endued with life; the dead man gradually rose up, and leaned
himself upon his elbow; he paused a moment like one newly recalled to life; 
he
seemed to become assured he did live.  He passed one hand through his hair,
which was wet, and then rose higher into a sitting posture, and then he 
leaned
on one hand, inclining himself towards the moon.

     His breast heaved with life, and a kind of deep inspiration, or groan,
came from him, as he first awoke to life, and then he seemed to pause for a
few moments.  He turned gradually over, till his head inclined down the
stream.

     Just below, the water deepened, and ran swiftly and silently on amid
meads and groves of trees.  The vampyre was revived; he awoke again to a
ghastly life; he turned from the heap of stones, he gradually allowed 
himself
to sink into deep water, and then, with a loud plunge, he swam to the centre
of the river.

     Slowly and surely did he swim into the centre of the river, and down 
the
stream he went.  He took long, but easy strokes, for he was going down the
stream, and that aided him.

     For some distance might he be heard and seen through the openings in 
the
trees, but he became gradually more and more indistinct, till sound and 
sight
both ceased, and the vampyre had disappeared.

     During the continuance of this singular scene, not one word had passed
between the landlord and his companions.  When the blacksmith fired the
fowling-piece, and saw the stranger fall, apparently lifeless, upon the
stepping-stones that crossed the river, he became terrified at what he had
done, and gazed upon the seeming lifeless form with a face on which the 
utmost
horror was depicted.

     They all seemed transfixed to the spot, and although each would have
given worlds to move away, a kind of nightmare seemed to possess them, which
stunned all their faculties, and brought over them a torpidity from which 
they
found it impossible to arouse themselves.

     But, when the apparently dead man moved again, and when, finally, the
body, which appeared so destitute of life, rolled into the stream, and 
floated
away with the tide, their fright might be considered to have reached its
climax.  The absence of the body, however, had seemingly, at all events, the
effect of releasing them from the mental and physical thraldom in which they
were, and they were enabled to move from the spot, which they did 
immediately,
making their way towards the town with great speed.

     As they got near, they held a sort of council of war as to what they
should do under the circumstances, the result of which was, that they came 
to
a conclusion to keep all that they had done and seen to themselves; for, if
they did not, they might be called upon for some very troublesome 
explanations
concerning the fate of the Hungarian nobleman whom they had taken upon
themselves to believe was a vampyre, and to shoot accordingly, without 
taking
the trouble to inquire into the legality of such an act.

     How such a secret was likely to be kept, when it was shared amongst 
seven
people, it is hard to say; but, if it were so kept, it could only be under 
the
pressure of a strong feeling of self-preservation.

     They were forced individually, of course, to account for their absence
during the night at their respective homes, and how they managed to do that 
is
best known to themselves.

     As to the landlord, he felt compelled to state that, having his
suspicions of his guest aroused, he followed him on a walk that he pretended
to take, and he had gone so far, that at length he had given up the chase, 
and
lost his own way in returning.

     Thus was it, then, that this affair still preserved all its mystery, 
with
a large superadded amount of fear attendant upon it; for, if the mysterious
guest were really anything supernatural, might he not come again in a much
more fearful shape, and avenge the treatment he had received?

     The only person who felt any disappointment in the affair, or whose
expectations were not realised, was the boy who had made the appointment 
with
the supposed vampyre at the end of the lane, and who was to have received 
what
he considered so large a reward for pointing out the retreat of Sir Francis
Varney.

     He waited in vain for the arrival of the Hungarian nobleman, and, at
last, indignation got the better of him, and he walked away.  Feeling that 
he
had been jilted, he resolved to proceed to the public-house and demand the
half-crowns which had been so liberally promised him; but when he reached
there he found that the party whom he sought was not within, nor the 
landlord
either, for that was the precise time when that worthy individual was 
pursuing
his guest over meadow and hill, through brake and briar, towards the 
stepping
stones on the river.

     What the boy further did on the following day, when he found that he 
was
to reap no more benefit for the adventure, we shall soon perceive.

     As for the landlord, he did endeavour to catch a few hours' brief 
repose;
but as he dreamed that the Hungarian nobleman came in the likeness of a 
great
toad, and sat upon his chest, feeling like the weight of a mountain, while 
he,
the landlord, tried to scream and cry for help, but found that he could
neither do one thing nor the other, we may guess that his repose did not at
all invigorate him.

     As he himself expressed it, he got up all of a shake, with a strong
impression that he was a very ill-used individual, indeed, to have had the
night-mare in the day time.

     And now we will return to the cottage where the Bannerworth family were
at all events, making themselves quite as happy as they did at their ancient
mansion, in order to see what is there passing, and how Dr. Chillingworth 
made
an effort to get up some evidence of something that the Bannerworth family
knew nothing of, therefore could not very well be expected to render him 
much
assistance.  That he did, however, make what he considered an important
discovery, we shall perceive in the course of the ensuing chapter, in which 
it
will be seen that the best hidden things will, by the merest accident,
sometimes come to light, and that, too, when least expected by any one at 
all
connected with the result.

THE DISCOVERY OF THE POCKETBOOK OF MARMADUKE BANNERWORTH. -- ITS MYSTERIOUS
CONTENTS.


     The little episode had just taken place which we have recorded between
the old admiral and Jack Pringle, when Henry Bannerworth and Charles Holland
stepped aside to converse.

     "Charles," said Henry, "it has become absolutely necessary that I 
should
put an end to this state of dependence in which we all live upon your uncle. 
It is too bad to think, that because, through fighting the battles of his
country, he has amassed some money, we are to eat it up."

     "My dear friend," said Charles, "does it not strike you, that it would 
be
a great deal worse than too bad, if my uncle could not do what he liked with
his own?"

     "Yes; but, Charles, that is not the question."

     "I think it is, though I know not what other question you can make of
it."

     "We have talked it over, my mother, my brother, and Flora; and my 
brother
and I have determined, if this state of things should last much longer, to
find out some means of honourable exertion by which we may, at all events,
maintain ourselves without being burdensome to any."

     "Well, well, we will talk of that another time."

     "Nay, but hear me; we were thinking that if we went into some branch of
the public service, your uncle would have the pleasure, such we are quite 
sure
it would be to him, of assisting us greatly by his name and influence."

     "Well, well, Henry, that's all very well; but for a little time do not
throw up the old man and make him unhappy.  I believe I am his only relative
in the world, and, as he has often said, he intended leaving me heir to all 
he
possesses, you see there is no harm done by your receiving a small portion 
of
it beforehand."

     "And," said Henry, "by that line of argument, we are to find an excuse
for robbing your uncle; in the fact, that we are robbing you likewise."

     "No, no; indeed, you do not view the matter rightly."

     "Well, all I can say is, Charles, that while I feel, and while we all
feel, the deepest debt of gratitude towards your uncle, it is our duty to do
something.  In a box which we have brought with us from the Hall, and which
has not been opened since our father's death, I have stumbled over some
articles of ancient jewellery and plate, which, at all events, will produce
something."

     "But which you must not part with."

     "Nay, but, Charles, these are things I knew not we possessed, and most
ill-suited do they happen to be to our fallen fortunes.  It is money we 
want,
not the gewgaws of a former state, to which we can have now no sort of
pretension."

     "Nay, I know you have all the argument; but still is there something 
sad
and uncomfortable to one's feelings in parting with such things as those 
which
have been in families for many years."

     "But we knew not that we had them; remember that, Charles. Come and 
look
at them.  Those relics of a bygone age may amuse you, and, as regards 
myself,
there are no circumstances whatever associated with them that give them any
extrinsic value; so laugh at them or admire them, as you please, I shall 
most
likely be able to join with you in either feeling."

     "Well, be it so -- I will come and look at them; but you must think
better of what you say concerning my uncle, for  I happen to know -- which 
you
ought likewise by this time -- how seriously the old man would feel any
rejection on your part of the good he fancies he is doing you.  I tell you,
Henry, it is completely his hobby, and let him have earned his money with 
ten
times the danger he has, he could not spend it with anything like the
satisfaction that he does, unless he were allowed to dispose of it in this
way."

     "Well, well; be it so for a time."

     "The fact is, his attachment to Flora is so great -- which is a most
fortunate circumstance for me -- that I should not be at all surprised that
she cuts me out of one half my estate, when the old man dies.  But come, we
will look at your ancient bijouterie."

     Henry led Charles into an apartment of the cottage where some of the 
few
things had been placed that were brought from Bannerworth Hall, which were 
not
likely to be in constant and daily use.

     Among these things happened to be the box which Henry had mentioned, 
and
from which he had taken a miscellaneous assortment of things of an antique 
and
singular character.

     There were old dresses of a season and of a taste long gone by; ancient
articles of defence; some curiously wrought daggers; and a few ornaments,
pretty, but valueless, along with others of more sterling pretensions, which
Henry pointed out to Charles.

     "I am almost inclined to think," said the latter, "that some of these
things are really of considerable value; but I do not profess to be an
accurate judge, and, perhaps, I am more taken with the beauty of an article,
than the intrinsic worth.  What is that which you have just taken from the
box?"

     "It seems a half-mask," said Henry, "made of silk; and here are initial
letters within it -- M. B."

     "To what do they apply?"

     "Marmaduke Bannerworth, my father."

     "I regret I asked you."

     "Nay, Charles, you need not.  Years have now elapsed since that 
misguided
man put a period to his own existence, in the gardens of Bannerworth Hall.  
Of
course, the shock was a great one to us all, although I must confess that we
none of us knew much of a father's affections.  But time reconciles one to
these dispensations, and to a friend, like yourself, I can talk upon these
subjects without a pang."

     He laid down the mask, and proceeded further in his search in the old
box.

     Towards the bottom of  it there were some books, and, crushed in by the
side of them, there was an ancient-looking pocket-book, which Charles 
pointed
out, saying, --

     "There, Henry, who knows but you may find a fortune when you least 
expect
it?"

     "Those who expect nothing," said Henry, "will not be disappointed.  At
all events, as regards this pocket-book, you see it is empty."

     "Not quite.  A card has fallen from it."

     Charles took up the card, and read upon it the name of Count Barrare.

     "That name," he said, "seems familiar to me.  Ah! now I recollect, I 
have
read of such a man.  He flourished some twenty, or five-and-twenty years 
ago,
and was considered a _roue_ of the first water -- a finished gamester; and, 
in
a sort of brief memoir I read once of him, it said that he disappeared
suddenly one day, and was never again heard of."

     "Indeed!  I'm not puzzled to think how his card came into my father's
pocket-book.  They met at some gaming-house; and, if some old pocket-book of
Count Barrare's were shaken, there might fall from it a card, with the name 
of
Mr. Marmaduke Bannerworth upon it."

     "Is there nothing further in the pocket-book -- no memoranda?"

     "I will look.  Stay! here is something upon one of the leaves -- let me
see -- 'Mem., twenty-five thousand pounds!  He who robs the robber, steals
little; it was not meant to kill him: but it will be unsafe to use the money
for a time -- my brain seems on fire -- the remotest hiding place in the 
house
is behind the picture."

     "What do you think of that?" said Charles.

     "I know not what to think.  There is one thing though, that I do know."

     "And what is that?"

     "It is my father's handwriting.  I have many scraps of his and his
peculiar hand is familiar to me."

     "It is very strange, then, what it can refer to."

     "Charles -- Charles! there is a mystery connected with our fortunes, 
that
I never could unravel; and once or twice it seemed as if we were upon the
point of discovering all; but something has ever interfered to prevent us, 
and
we have been thrown back into the realms of conjecture.  My father's last
words were, 'The money is hidden;' and then he tried to add something; but,
death stopped his utterance.  Now, does it not almost seem that this
memorandum alluded to the circumstance?"

     "It does, indeed."

     "And then, scarcely had my father breathed his last, when a man comes 
and
asked for him at the garden-gate, and, upon hearing that he is dead, utters
some imprecations, and walks away."

     "Well, Henry, you must trust to time and circumstances to unravel these
mysteries.  For myself, I own that I cannot do so; I see no earthly way out 
of
the difficulty whatever.  But still it does appear to me as if Dr.
Chillingworth knew something or had heard something, with which he really
ought to make you acquainted."

     "Do not blame the worthy doctor; he may have made an error in judgment,
but never one of feeling; and you may depend, if he is keeping anything from
me, that he is doing so from some excellent motive; more probably because he
thinks it will give me pain, and so will not let me endure any unhappiness
from it, unless he is quite certain as regards the facts.  When he is so, 
you
may depend he will be communicative, and I shall know all that he has to
relate.  But, Charles, it is evident to me that you, too, are keeping
something."

     "I!"

     "Yes; you acknowledge to having had an interview, and a friendly one,
with Varney; and you likewise acknowledge that he had told you things which 
he
has compelled you to keep secret."

     "I have promised to keep them secret, and I deeply regret the promise
that I have made.  There cannot be anything to my mind more essentially
disagreeable than to have one's tongue tied in one's interview with friends. 
I hate to hear anything that I may not repeat to those whom I take into my 
own
confidence."

     "I can understand the feeling; but here comes the worthy doctor."

     "Show him the memorandum."

     "I will."

     As Dr. Chillingworth entered the apartments Henry handed him the
memorandum that had been found in the old pocket-book, saying as he did so, 
--

     "Look at that, doctor, and give us your candid opinion upon it."

     Dr. Chillingworth fitted on his spectacles, and read the paper 
carefully.
At its conclusion, he screwed up his mouth into an extremely small compass,
and doubling up the paper, he put it into his capacious waistcoat pocket,
saying as he did so, --

     "Oh! oh! oh! hum!"

     "Well, doctor," said Henry; "we are waiting for your opinion."

     "My opinion!  Well, then, my dear boy, I must say, my opinion, to the
best of my belief is, that I really don't know anything about it."

     "Then, perhaps, you'll surrender us the memorandum," said Charles
"because, if you don't know anything, we may as well make a little inquiry."

     "Ha!" said the worthy doctor; "we can't put old heads upon young
shoulders, that's quite clear.  Now, my good young men, be patient and 
quiet;
recollect, that what you know you're acquainted with, and that that which is
hidden from you, you cannot very well come to any very correct conclusion
upon. There's a right side and a wrong one you may depend, to every 
question;
and he who walks heedlessly in the dark, is very apt to run his head against 
a
post.  Good evening, my boys -- good evening."

     Away bustled the doctor.

     "Well," said Charles, "what do you think of that, Mr. Henry?"

     "I think he knows what he's about."

     "That may be; but I'll be hanged if anybody else does.  The doctor is 
by
no means favourable to the march of popular information; and I really think 
he
might have given us some food for reflection, instead of leaving us so 
utterly
and entirely at fault as he has; and you know he's taken away your 
memorandum
even."

     "Let him have it, Charles -- let him have it; it is safe with him.  The
old man may be, and I believe is, a little whimsical and crotchety; but he
means abundantly well, and he's just one of those sort of persons, and 
always
was, who will do good his own way, or not at all; so we must take the good
with the bad in those cases, and let Dr. Chillingworth do as he pleases."

     "I cannot say it is nothing to me, although those words were rising to 
my
lips, because you know, Henry, that everything which concerns you or yours 
is
something to me; and therefore it is that I feel extremely anxious for the
solution of all this mystery.  Before I hear the sequel of that which 
Varney,
the vampyre, has so strongly made me a confidant of, I will, at all events,
make an effort to procure his permission to communicate it to all those who
are in any way beneficially interested in the circumstances.  Should he 
refuse
me that permission, I am almost inclined myself to beg him to withhold his
confidence."

     "Nay, do not do so, Charles -- do not do that, I implore you.  
Recollect,
although you cannot make us joint recipients with you in your knowledge, you
can make use of it, probably, to our advantage, in saving us, perchance, 
from
the different consequences, so that you can make what you know in some way
beneficial to us, although not in every way."

     "There is reason in that, and I give in at once.  Be it so, Henry.  I
will wait on him, and if I cannot induce him to change his determination, 
and
allow me to tell some other as well as Flora, I must give in, and take the
thing as a secret, although I shall not abandon a hope, even after he has 
told
me all he has to tell, that I may induce him to permit me to make a general
confidence, instead of a partial one he has empowered me to do."

     "It may be so; and, at all events, we must not reject a proffered good
because it is not quite so complete as might be."

     "You are right; I will keep my appointment with him, entertaining the
most sanguine hope that our troubles and disasters -- I say our, because I
consider myself quite associated in thought, interest, and feelings with 
your
family -- may soon be over."

     "Heaven grant it may be so, for your's and Flora's sake; but I feel 
that
Bannerworth Hall will never again be the place it was to us.  I should 
prefer
that we sought for new associations, which I have no doubt we may find, and
that among us we get up some other home that would be happier, because not
associated with so many sad scenes in our history."

     "Be it so; and I am sure that the admiral would gladly give way to such
an arrangement.  He has often intimated that he thought Bannerworth Hall was 
a
dull place; consequently, although he pretends to have purchased it of you, 
I
think he will be very glad to leave it."

     "Be it so, then.  If it should really happen that we are upon the eve 
of
any circumstances that will really tend to relieve us from our mystery and
embarrassments, we will seek for some pleasanter abode than the Hall, which
you may well imagine, since it became the scene of that dreadful tragedy 
that
left us fatherless, has borne but a distasteful appearance to all our eyes."

     "I don't wonder at that, and am only surprised that, after such a thing
had happened, any of you liked to inhabit the place."

     "We did not like, but our poverty forced us.  You have no notion of the
difficulties through which we have struggled; and the fact that we had a 
home
rent free was one of so much importance to us, that had it been surrounded 
by
a thousand more disagreeables than it was, we must have put up with it; but
now that we owe so much to the generosity of your uncle, I suppose we can
afford to talk of what we like and of what we don't like."

     "You can, Henry, and it shall not be my fault if you do not always 
afford
to do so; and now, as the time is drawing on, I think I will proceed at once
to Varney, for it is better to be soon than late, and get from him the
remainder of the story."

                            *     *     *     *

     There were active influences at work, to prevent Sir Francis Varney 
from
so quickly as he had arranged to do, carrying out his intention of making
Charles Holland acquainted with the history of the eventful period of his
life, which had been associated with Marmaduke Bannerworth.

     One would have scarcely thought it possible that anything now would 
have
prevented Varney from concluding his strange narrative; but that he was
prevented, will appear.

     The boy who had been promised such liberal payment by the Hungarian
nobleman, for betraying the place of Varney's concealment, we have already
stated, felt bitterly the disappointment of not being met, according to
promise, at the corner of the lane, by that individual.

     It not only deprived him of the half-crowns, which already in 
imagination
he had laid out, but it was a great blow to his own importance, for after 
his
discovery of the residence of the vampyre, he looked upon himself as quite a
public character, and expected great applause for his cleverness.

     But when the Hungarian nobleman came not, all these dreams began to
vanish into thin air, and, like the unsubstantial fabric of a vision, to 
leave
no trace behind them.

     He got dreadfully aggravated, and his first thought was to go to 
Varney,
and see what he could get from him, by betraying the fact that some one was
actively in search of him.

     That seemed, however, a doubtful good, and perhaps there was some
personal dread of the vampyre mixed up with the rejection of this 
proposition.
But reject it he did, and then he walked moodily into the town without any
fixed resolution of what he should do.

     All that he thought of was a general idea that he should like to create
some mischief, if possible -- what it was he cared not, so long as it made a
disturbance.

     Now, he knew well that the most troublesome and fidgetty man in the 
town
was Tobias Philpots, a saddler, who was always full of everybody's business
but his own, and ever ready to hear any scandal of his neighbours.

     "I have a good mind," said the boy, "to go to old Philpots, and tell 
him
all about it, that I have."

     The good mind soon strengthened itself into a fixed resolution, and 
full
of disdain and indignation at the supposed want of faith of the Hungarian
nobleman, he paused opposite the saddler's door.

     Could he but for a moment have suspected the real reason why the
appointment had not been kept with him, all his curiosity would have been
doubly aroused, and he would have followed the landlord of the inn and his
associate upon the track of the second vampyre that had visited the town.

     But of this he knew nothing, for that proceeding had been conducted 
with
amazing quietness; and the fact of the Hungarian nobleman, when he found 
that
he was followed, taking a contrary course to that in which Varney was
concealed, prevented the boy from knowing anything of his movements.

     Hence the thing looked to him like a piece of sheer neglect and
contemptuous indifference, which he felt bound to resent.

     He did not pause long at the door of the saddler's, but, after a few
moments, he walked boldly in, and said, --

     "Master Philpots, I have got something extraordinary to tell you, and 
you
may give me what you like for telling you."

     "Go on, then," said the saddler, "that's just the price I always likes 
to
pay for everything."

     "Will you keep it secret?" said the boy.

     "Of course I will.  When did you ever hear of me telling anything to a
single individual?"

     "Never to a single individual, but I have heard you tell things to the
whole town."

     "Confound your impudence.  Get out of my shop directly."

     "Oh! very good.  I can go and tell old Mitchell, the pork-butcher."

     "No, I say -- stop; don't tell him.  If anybody it to know, let it be 
me,
and I'll promise you I'll keep it secret, so that if it gets known, you know
it cannot be any fault of mine."

     The fact was, the boy was anxious it should be known, only that in case
some consequences might arise, he thought he would quiet his own conscience,
by getting a promise of secrecy from Tobias Philpots, which he well knew 
that
individual would not think of keeping.

     He then related to him the interview he had had with the Hungarian
nobleman at the inn, how he had promised a number of half-crowns, but a very
small instalment of which he had received.

     All this Master Philpots cared very little for, but the information 
that
the much dreaded Varney, the vampyre, was concealed so close to the town was 
a
matter of great and abounding interest, and at that part of the story he
suddenly pricked up his ears amazingly.

     "Why, you don't mean to say that?" he exclaimed.  "Are you sure it was
he?"

     "Yes, I am quite certain.  I have seen him more than once. It was Sir
Francis Varney, without any mistake."

     "Why, then, you may depend he's only waiting until it's very dark, and
then he will walk into somebody, and suck his blood. Here's a horrid
discovery!  I though we had had enough of Master Varney, and that he would
hardly show himself here again, and now you tell me he is not ten minutes'
walk off."

     "It's a fact," said the boy.  "I saw him go in, and he looks thinner 
and
more horrid than ever.  I am sure he wants a dollop of blood from somebody."

     "I shouldn't wonder."

     "Now there is Mrs. Philpots, you know, sir; she's rather big, and seems
most ready to burst always; I shouldn't wonder if the vampyre came to her 
to-
night."

     "Wouldn't you?" said Mrs. Philpots, who had walked into the shop, and
overheard the whole conversation; "wouldn't you, really?  I'll vampyre you,
and teach you to make these remarks about respectable married women.  You
young wretch, take that, will you!"

     She gave the boy such a box on the ears, that the place seemed to spin
round with him.  As soon as he recovered sufficiently to be enabled to walk,
he made his way from the shop with abundance of precipitation, much 
regretting
that he had troubled himself to make a confidant of Master Philpots.

     But, however, he could not but tell himself that if the object was to
make a general disturbance through the whole place, he had certainly 
succeeded
in doing so.

     He slunk home perhaps with a feeling that he might be called upon to 
take
part in something that might ensue, and at all events be compelled to become 
a
guide to the place of Sir Francis Varney's retreat, in which case, for all 
he
knew, the vampyre might, by some more than mortal means, discover what a 
hand
he had had in the matter, and punish him accordingly.

     The moment he had left the saddler's Mrs. Philpots, after using some
bitter reproaches to her husband for not at once sacrificing the boy upon 
the
spot for the disrespectful manner in which he had spoken to her, hastily put
on her bonnet and shawl, and the saddler, although it was a full hour before
the usual time, began putting up the shutters of his shop.

     "Why, my dear," he said to Mrs. Philpots, when she came down stairs
equipped for the streets, "why, my dear, where are you going?"

     "And pray, sir, what are you shutting up the shop for at this time of 
the
evening?"

     "Oh! why, the fact is, I though I'd just go to the Rose and Crown, and
mention that the vampyre was so near at hand."

     "Well, Mr. Philpots, and in that case there can be no harm in my 
calling
upon some of my acquaintance and mentioning it likewise."

     "Why, I don't suppose there would be much harm; only remember, Mrs.
Philpots, remember if you please --  "

     "Remember what?"

     "To tell everyone to keep it a secret."

     "Oh, of course I will; and mind you do it likewise."

     "Most decidedly."

     The shop was closed, Mr. Philpots ran off to the Rose and Crown, and 
Mrs.
Philpots, with as much expedition as she could, purposed making the grand 
tour
of all her female acquaintance in the town, just to tell them, as a great
secret, that the vampyre, Sir Francis Varney, as he called himself, had 
taken
refuge at the house that was to let down the lane leading to Higg's farm.

     "But by no means," she said, "let it go no further, because it is a 
very
wrong thing to make any disturbance, and you will understand that it's quite 
a
secret."

     She was listened to with breathless attention, as may well be supposed,
and it was a singular circumstance that at every house she left some other
lady put on her bonnet and shawl, and ran out to make the circle of her
acquaintance, with precisely the same story, and precisely the same
injunctions to secrecy.

     And, as Mr. Philpots pursued an extremely similar course, we are not
surprised that in the short space of one hour the news should have spread
through all the town, and that there was scarcely a child old enough to
understand what was being talked about, who was ignorant of the fact, that 
Sir
Francis Varney was to be found at the empty house down the lane.

     It was an unlucky time, too, for the night was creeping on, a period at
which people's apprehension of the supernatural becomes each moment stronger
and more vivid -- a period at which a number of idlers are let loose for
different employments, and when anything in the shape of a row or a riot
presents itself in pleasant colours to those who have nothing to lose, and 
who
expect, under the cover of darkness, to be able to commit outrages they 
would
be afraid to think of in the daytime, when recognition would be more easy.

     Thus was it that Sir Francis Varney's position, although he knew it 
not,
became momentarily one of extreme peril, and the danger he was about to run,
was certainly greater than any he had as yet experienced.  Had Charles 
Holland
but known what was going on, he would undoubtedly have done something to
preserve the supposed vampyre from the mischief that threatened him, but the
time had not arrived when he had promised to pay him a second visit, so he 
had
no idea of anything serious having occurred.

     Perhaps, too, Mr. and Mrs. Philpots scarcely anticipated creating so 
much
confusion, but when they found that the whole place was in an uproar, and 
that
a tumultuous assemblage of persons called aloud for vengeance upon Varney, 
the
vampyre, they made their way home again in no small fright.

     And, now, what was the result of all these proceedings will be best 
known
by our introducing the reader to the interior of the house in which Varney 
had
found a temporary refuge, and following in detail his proceedings as he 
waited
for the arrival of Charles Holland.

Escape.

                              Chapter LXXXVII.

THE HUNT FOR VARNEY.-- THE HOUSE-TOPS. -- THE MIRACULOUS ESCAPE. -- THE LAST
PLACE OF REFUGE.


     On the tree tops the moon shines brightly, and the long shadows are
shooting its rays down upon the waters, and the green fields appear clothed 
in
a flood of silver light; the little town was quiet and tranquil -- nature
seemed at rest.

     The old mansion in which Sir Francis Varney had taken refuge, stood 
empty
and solitary; it seemed as though it were not associated with the others by
which it was surrounded.  It was gloomy, and in the moonlight it reminded 
one
of things long gone by, existences that had once been, but now no longer of
this present time -- a mere memento of the past.

     Sir Francis Varney reclined upon the house-top: he gazed upon the sky,
and upon the earth; he saw the calm tranquility that reigned around, and 
could
not but admire what he saw; he sighed, he seemed to sigh, from a pleasure he
felt in the fact of his security; he could repose there without fear, and
breathe the balmy air that fanned his cheek.

     "Certainly," he muttered, "things might have been worse, but not much
worse; however, they might have been much better; the ignorant are always 
the
most to be feared, because they have no guide and no control, save what can 
be
exerted over them by their fears and their passions."

     He paused to look again over the scene, and, as far as the eye could
reach, and that, moonlight as it was, was many miles, the country was
diversified with hill and dale, meadow and ploughed land; the open fields, 
and
the darker woods, and the silvery stream that ran at no great distance, all
presented a scene that was well calculated to warm the imagination, and to
give the mind that charm which a cultivated understanding is capable of
receiving.

     There was but one thing wanted to make such a scene one of pure
happiness, and that was all absence of care of fears for the future and the
wants of life.

     Suddenly there was a slight sound that came from the town. It was very
slight, but the ears of Sir Francis Varney were painfully acute of late; the
least sound that came across him was heard in a moment, and his whole visage
was changed to one of listening interest.

     The sound was hushed; but his attention was not lulled, for he had been
placed in circumstances that made all his vigilance necessary for his own
preservation.  Hence it was, what another would have passed over, or not 
heard
at all, he both heard and noticed.  He was not sure of the nature of the
sound, it was so slight and so indistinct.

     There it was again!  Some persons were moving about in the town.  The
sounds that came upon the night air seemed to say that there was an unusual
bustle in the town, which was, to Sir Francis Varney, ominous in the 
extreme.

     What could people in such a quiet, retired place require out at such an
hour at night?  It must be something very unusual -- something that must
excite them to a great degree; and Sir Francis began to feel very uneasy.

     "They surely," he muttered to himself -- "they surely cannot have found
out my hiding place, and intend to hunt me from it, the blood-thirsty 
hounds!
they are never satisfied.  The mischief they are permitted to do on one
occasion is but the precursor to another.  The taste has caused the appetite
for more, and nothing short of his blood can satisfy it."

     The sounds increased, and the noise came nearer and nearer, and it
appeared as though a number of men had collected together, and were coming
towards him.  Yes, they were coming down the lane towards the deserted 
mansion
where he was.

     For once in his life, Sir Francis Varney trembled; he felt sick at 
heart,
though no man was less likely to give up hope and to despair than he; yet 
this
sign of unrelenting hatred and persecution was too unequivocal and too stern
not to produce its effect upon even his mind; for he had no doubt but that
they were coming with the express purpose of seeking him.

     How they could have found him out was a matter he could not imagine.  
The
Bannerworths could not have betrayed him -- he was sure of that; and yet who
could have seen him, so cautious and so careful as he had been, and so very
sparing had he lived, because he would not give the slightest cause for all
that was about to follow.  He hoped to have hidden himself; but now he could
hear the tramp of men distinctly, and their voices came now on the night 
air,
thought it was in a subdued tone, as if they were desirous of approaching
unheard and unseen by their victim.

     Sir Francis Varney stirred not from his position.  He remained silent 
and
motionless.  He appeared not to heed what was going on; perhaps he hoped to
see them go by -- to be upon some false scent; or, if they saw no signs of
life, they might leave the place, and go elsewhere.

     Hark! they stop at the house -- they go not by; they seem to pause, and
then a thundering knock came at the door, which echoed and re-echoed through
the empty and deserted house, on the top of which sat, in silent 
expectation,
the almost motionless Sir Francis Varney, the redoubted vampyre.

     The knock which came so loud and so hard upon the door caused Sir 
Francis
to start visibly, for it seemed his own knell. Then, as if the mob were
satisfied with their knowledge of his presence, and of their victory, they
sent up a loud shout that filled the whole neighborhood with its sound.

     It seemed to come from below and around the house; it rose from all
sides, and that told Sir Francis Varney that the house was surrounded and 
all
escape was cut off; there was no chance of his being able to rush through 
such
a multitude of men as that which now encircled him.

     With the calmest despair, Sir Francis Varney lay still and motionless 
on
the housetop, and listened to the sounds that proceeded from below.  Shout
after shout arose on the still, calm air of the night; knock after knock 
came
upon the stout old door, which awakened responsive echoes throughout the 
house
that had for many years lain dormant, and which now seemed disturbed, and
resounded in hollow murmurs to the voices from without.

     Then a loud voice shouted from below, as if to be heard by any one who
might be within, --

     "Sir Francis Varney, the vampyre, come out and give yourself up at
discretion!  If we have to search for you, you may depend it will be to 
punish
you; you will suffer by burning.  Come out and give yourself up."

     There was a pause, and then a loud shout.

     Sir Francis Varney paid no attention to this summons, but sat,
motionless, on the house-top, where he could hear all that passed below in 
the
crowd.

     "He will not come out," said one.

     "Ah! he's much too cunning to be caught in such a trap. Why, he knows
what you would do with him; he knows you would stake him, and make a bonfire
about him."

     "So he has no taste for roasting," remarked another; "but still, it's 
no
use hiding; we have too many hands, and know the house too well to be easily
baffled."

     "That may be; and although he don't like burning, yet we will unearth 
the
old fox, somehow or other; we have discovered his haunt at last, and 
certainly
we'll have him out."

     "How shall we get in?"

     "Knock in the door -- break open the door! the front door -- that is 
the
best, because it leads to all parts of the house, and we can secure any one
who attempts to move from one to the other, as they come down."

     "Hurrah!" shouted several men in the crowd.

     "Hurrah!" echoed the mob, with one accord, and the shout rent the air,
and disturbed the quiet and serenity that scarce five minutes before reigned
throughout the place.

     Then, as if actuated by one spirit, they all set to work to force the
door in.  It was strong, and capable of great defence, and employed them, 
with
some labour, for fifteen or twenty minutes, and then, with a loud crash, the
door fell in.

     "Hurrah!" again shouted the crowd.

     These shouts announced the fall of the door, and then, and not until
then, did Sir Francis Varney stir.

     "They have broken the door," he muttered; "well, if die I must, I will
sell my life dearly.  However, all is not yet lost, and, in the struggle for
life, the loss is not so much felt."

     He got up, and crept towards the trap that led into the house, or out 
of
it, as the occasion might require.

     "The vampyre! the vampyre!" shouted a man who stood on a garden wall,
holding on by the arm of an apple-tree.

     "Varney, the vampyre!" shouted a second.

     "Hurrah! boys, we are on the right scent; now for a hunt; hurrah! we
shall have him now."

     They rushed in a tumultuous riot up the stone steps, and into the hall.
It was a large, spacious place, with a grand staircase that led up to the
upper floor, but it had two ends, and then terminated in a gallery.

     It could not be defended by one man, save at the top, where it could 
not
long be held, because the assailants could unite, and throw their whole 
weight
against the entrance, and thus storm it.  This actually happened.

     They looked up, and seeing nobody, they rushed up, some by one stair, 
and
some by the other; but it was dark; there were but few of the moon's rays 
that
pierced the gloom of that place, and those who first reached the place which
we have named, were seized with astonishment, staggered, and fell.

     Sir Francis Varney had met them; he stood there with a staff -- 
something
he had found about the house -- not quite so long as a broom-handle, but
somewhat thicker and heavier, being made of stout ash.

     This formidable weapon, Sir Francis Varney wielded with strength and
resolution; he was a tall man, and one of no mean activity and personal
strength, and such a weapon, in his hands, was one of a most fearful
character, and, for the occasion, much better than his sword.

     Man after man fell beneath the fearful force of these blows, for though
they could not see Sir Francis, yet he could see them, for the hall-lights
were behind them at the time, while he stood in the dark, and took advantage
of this to deal murderous blows upon his assailants.

     This continued for some minutes, till they gave way before such a
vigorous defiance, and paused.

     "On, neighbours, on," cried one; "will you be beaten off by one man? 
Rush in at once and you must force him from his position -- push him hard, 
and
he must give way."

     "Ay," said one fellow who sat upon the ground rubbing his head; "its 
all
very well to say push him hard, but if you felt the weight of that d----d 
pole
on your head, you wouldn't be in such a blessed hurry."

     However true that might be, there was but little attention paid to it,
and a determined rush was made at the entrance to the gallery, and they 
found
that it was unoccupied; and that was explained by the slamming of a door, 
and
its being immediately locked upon them; and when the mob came to the door,
they found they had to break their way through another door.

     This did not take long in effecting; and in less than five minutes they
had broken through that door which led into another room; but the first man
who entered it fell from a crashing blow on the head from the ashen staff of
Sir Francis Varney, who hurried and fled, closely pursued, until he came to
another door, through which he dashed.

     Here he endeavoured to make a stand and close it, but was immediately
struck and grappled with; but he threw his assailant, and turned and fled
again.

     His object had been to defend each inch of the ground as long as he was
able; but he found they came too close upon his steps, and prevented his
turning in time to try the strength of his staff upon the foremost.

     He dashed up the first staircase with surprising rapidity, leaving his
pursuers behind; and when he had gained the first landing, he turned upon
those who pursued him, who could hardly follow him two abreast.

     "Down with the vampyre!" shouted the first, who rushed up heedless of 
the
staff.

     "Down with a fool!" thundered Varney, as he struck the fellow a 
terrific
blow, which covered his face with blood, and he fell back into the arms of 
his
companions.

     A bitter groan and execration arose from them below, and again they
shouted, and rushed up headlong.

     "Down with the vampyre!" was again shouted, and met by a corresponding,
but deep guttural sound of --

     "Down with a fool!"

     And sure enough the first again came to the earth without any
preparation, save the application of an ashen stick to his skull, which, by-
the-bye, by no means aided the operation of thinking.

     Several more shared a similar fate; but they pressed hard, and Sir
Francis was compelled to give ground to keep them at the necessary length 
from
him, as they rushed on regardless of his blows, and if he had not he would
soon have been engaged in a personal struggle, for they were getting too 
close
for him to use the staff.

     "Down with the vampyre!" was the renewed cry, as they drove him from 
spot
to spot until he reached the roof of the house, and then he ran up the steps
to the loft, which he had just reached when they came to the bottom.

     Varney attempted to draw the ladder up, but four or five stout men held
that down; then by a sudden turn, as they were getting up, he turned it 
over,
threw those on it down, and the ladder too, upon the heads of those who were
below.

     "Down with the vampyre!" shouted the mob, as they, with the most 
untiring
energy, set the ladder, or steps, against the loft, and as many as could 
held
it, while others rushed up to attack Varney with all the ferocity and 
courage
of so many bull dogs.

     It was strange, but the more they were baffled the more enraged and
determined they rushed on to a new attack, with greater resolution than 
ever.

     On this occasion, however, they were met with a new kind of missile, 
for
Sir Francis had either collected and placed there for the occasion, or they
had been left there for years, a number of old bricks, which lay close at
hand.  These he took, one by one, and deliberately took aim at them, and 
flung
them with great force, striking down every one they hit.

     This caused them to recoil; the bricks caused fearful gashes in their
heads, and the wounds were serious, the flesh being, in many places, torn
completely off.  They however, only paused, for one man said, --

     "Be of good heart, comrades, we can do as he does; he has furnished us
with weapons, and we can thus attack him in two ways, and he must give way 
in
the end."

     "Hurrah! down with the vampyre!" sounded from all sides, and the shout
was answered by a corresponding rush.

     It was true; Sir Francis had furnished them with weapons to attack
himself, for they could throw them back at him, which they did, and struck 
him
a severe blow on the head, and it covered his face with blood in a moment.

     "Hurrah!" shouted the assailants; "another such blow, and all will be
over with the vampyre."

     "He's got -- "

     "Press him sharp, now," cried another man, as he aimed another blow 
with
a brick, which struck Varney on the arm, causing him to drop the brick he 
held
in his hand.  He staggered back, apparently in great pain.

     "Up! up! we have him now; he cannot get away; he's hurt; we have him --
we have him!"

     And up they went with all the rapidity they could scramble up the 
steps;
but this had given Varney time to recover himself; and though his right arm
was almost useless, yet he contrived, with his left, to pitch the bricks so 
as
to knock over the first three or four, when, seeing that he could not 
maintain
his position to advantage, he rushed to the outside of the house, the last
place he had capable of defence.

     There was a great shout by those outside, when they saw him come out 
and
stand with his staff, and those who came first got first served, for the 
blows
resounded, while he struck them, and sent them over below.

     Then came a great shout from within and without, and then a desperate
rush was made at the door, and, in the next instant, Varney was seen flying,
followed by his pursuers, one after the other, some tumbling over the tiles,
to the imminent hazard of their necks.  Sir Francis Varney rushed along with 
a
speed that appeared by far too great to admit of being safely followed, and
yet those who followed appeared infected by his example, and appeared 
heedless
of all consequences by which their pursuit might be attended to themselves.

     "Hurrah!" shouted the mob below.

     "Hurrah!" shouted the mob on the tiles.

     Then, over several housetops might be seen the flying figure of Sir
Francis Varney, pursued by different men at a pace almost equal to his own.

     They, however, could keep up the same speed, and not improve upon it,
while he kept the advantage he first obtained in the start.

     Then suddenly he disappeared.

     It seemed to the spectators below that he had dropped through a house,
and they immediately surrounded the house, as well as they could, and then 
set
up another shout.

     This took place several times, and as often was the miserable man 
hunted
from his place of refuge only to seek another, from which he was in like
manner hunted by those who thirsted for his blood.

     On one occasion, they drove into a house which was surrounded, save at
one point, which had a long room, or building in it, that ran some distance
out, and about twenty feet high.

     At the entrance to the roof of this place, or leads, he stood and
defended himself for some moments with success; but having received a blow
himself, he was compelled to retire, while the mob behind forced those in
front forward faster than he could by any exertion wield the staff that had 
so
much befriended him on this occasion.

     He was, therefore, on the point of being overwhelmed by numbers, when 
he
fled; but, alas! there was no escape; a bare coping stone and rails ran 
round
the top of that.

     There was not much time for hesitation, but he jumped over the rails 
and
looked below.  It was a great height, but if he fell and hurt himself, he 
knew
he was at the mercy of the bloodhounds behind him, who would do anything but
show him any mercy, or spare him a single pang.

     He looked round and beheld his pursuers close upon him, and one was so
close to him that he seized upon his arm, saying, as he shouted to his
companions, --

     "Hurrah, boys!  I have him."

     With an execration, Sir Francis wielded his staff with such force, that
he struck the fellow in the head, crushing in his hat as if it had been only
so much paper.  The man fell, but a blow followed from some one else which
caused Varney to relax his hold, and finding himself falling, he, to save
himself, sprang away.

     The rails, at that moment, were crowded with men who leaned over to
ascertain the effect of the leap.

     "He'll be killed," said one.

     "He's sure to be smashed," said another.

     "I'll lay any wager he'll break a limb!" said a third.

     Varney came to the earth -- for a moment he lay stunned, and not able 
to
move hand or foot.

     "Hurrah!" shouted the mob.

     Their triumph was short, for just as they shouted Varney arose, and 
after
a moment or two's stagger he set off at full speed, which produced another
shout from the mob; and just at that moment, a body of his pursuers were 
seen
scaling the walls after him.

     There was now a hunt through all the adjoining fields -- from cover 
after
cover they pursued him until he found no rest from the hungry wolves that
beset him with cries, resembling beasts of prey rather than any human
multitude.

     Sir Francis heard them, at the same time, with the despair of a man who
is struggling for life, and yet knows he is struggling in vain; he knew his
strength was decaying -- his immense exertions and the blows he had 
received,
all weakened him, while the number and strength of his foes seemed rather to
increase than to diminish.

     Once more he sought the houses, and for a moment he believed himself
safe, but that was only a momentary deception, for they had traced him.

     He arrived at a garden wall, over which he bounded, and then he rushed
into the house, the door of which stood open, for the noise and disturbance
had awakened most of the inhabitants, who were out in all directions.

     He took refuge in a small closet on the stairs, but was seen to do so 
by
a girl, who screamed out with fear and fright,

     "Murder! murder! -- the wampyre! -- the wampyre!" with all her 
strength,
and in the way of screaming that was no little, and then she went off into a
fit.

     This was signal enough, and the house was at once entered, and beset on
all sides by the mob, who came impatient of obtaining their victim who had 
so
often baffled them.

     "There he is -- there he is," said the girl, who came to as soon as 
other
people came up.

     "Where? -- where?"

     "In that closet," she said, pointing to it with her finger. "I see'd 
him
go in the way above."

     Sir Francis, finding himself betrayed, immediately came out of the
closet, just as two or three were advancing to open it, and dealt so hard a
blow on the head of the first that came near him that he fell without a 
groan,
and a second shared the same fate; and then Sir Francis found himself 
grappled
with, but with a violent effort he relieved himself and rushed up the 
stairs.

     "Oh! murder -- the wampyre! what shall I do -- fire -- fire!"

     These exclamations were uttered in consequence of Varney in his haste 
to
get up stairs, having inadvertently stepped into the girl's lap with one 
foot,
while he kicked her in the chin with the other, besides scratching her nose
till it bled.

     "After him -- stick to him," shouted the mob, but the girl kicked and
sprawled so much they were impeded, till, regardless of her cries, they ran
over her and pursued Varney, who was much distressed with the exertions he 
had
made.

     After about a minute's race he turned upon the head of the stairs, not 
so
much taking some breathing time; but seeing his enemies so close, he drew 
his
sword, and stood panting, but prepared.

     "Never mind his toasting-fork," said one bulky fellow, and, as he 
spoke,
he rushed on, but the point of the weapon entered his heart and he fell 
dead.

     There was a dreadful execration uttered by those who came up after him,
and there was a momentary pause, for none liked to rush on to the bloody 
sword
of Sir Francis Varney, who stood so willing and so capable of using it with
the most deadly effect. They paused, as well they might, and this pause was
the most welcome thing next to life to the unfortunate fugitive, for he was
dreadfully distressed and bleeding.

     "On to him boys!  He can hardly stand.  See how he pants. On to him, I
say -- push him hard."

     "He pushes hard, I tell you," said another.  "I felt the point of his
sword, as it came through Giles's back."

     "I'll try my luck, then," said another, and he rushed up; but he was 
met
by the sword of Sir Francis, who pierced it through his side, and he fell 
back
with a groan.

     Sir Francis, fearful of stopping any longer to defend that point,
appeared desirous of making good his retreat with some little advantage, and
he rushed up stairs before they had recovered from the momentary 
consternation
into which they had been thrown by the sudden disaster they had received.

     But they were quickly after him, and before he, wearied as he was, 
could
gain the roof, they were up the ladder after him.

     The first man who came through the trap was again set upon by Varney, 
who
made a desperate thrust at him, and it took effect; but the sword snapped by
the handle.

     With an execration, Sir Francis threw the hilt at the head of the next
man he saw; then rushing, with headlong speed, he distanced his pursuers for
some house tops.

     But the row of houses ended at the one he was then at, and he could go 
no
further.  What was to be done?  The height was by far too great to be 
jumped;
death was certain.  A hideous heap of crushed and mangled bones would be the
extent of what would remain of him, and then, perhaps, life not extinct for
some hours afterwards.

     He turned round; he saw them coming hallooing over the house tops, like 
a
pack of hounds.  Sir Francis struck his hands together, and groaned.  He
looked round, and perceived some ivy peeping over the coping-stone.  A 
thought
struck him, and he instantly ran to the spot and leaned over.

     "Saved -- saved!" he exclaimed.

     Then, placing his hand over, he felt for the ivy; then he got over, and
hung by the coping-stone, in a perilous position, till he found a spot on
which he could rest his foot, and then he grasped the ivy as low down as he
could, and thus he lowered himself a short way, till he came to where the 
ivy
was stronger and more secure to the wall, as the upper part was very 
dangerous
with his weight attached to it.

     The mob came on, very sure of having Sir Francis Varney in their power,
and they did not hurry on so violently, as their position was dangerous at
that hour of the night.

     "Easy, boys, easy," was the cry.  "The bird is our own; he can't get
away, that's very certain."

     They, however, came on, and took no time about it hardly; but what was
their amazement and rage at finding he had disappeared.

     "Where is he?" was the universal inquiry, and "I don't know," an almost
universal answer.

     There was a long pause, while they searched around; but they saw no
vestige of the object of their search.

     "There's no trap door open," remarked one; "and I don't think he could
have got in any one."

     "Perhaps, finding he could not get away, he has taken the desperate
expedient of jumping over, and committing suicide, and so escape the doom he
ought to be subjected to."

     "Probably he has; but then we can run a stake through him and burn him
all the same."

     They now approached the extreme verge of the houses, and looked over 
the
sides, but they could see nothing.  The moon was up, and there was light
enough to have seen him if he had fallen to the earth, and they were quite
sure that he could not have got up after such a fall as he must have 
received.

     "We are beaten after all, neighbours."

     "I am not so sure of that," was the reply.  "He may now be hidden 
about,
for he was too far spent to be able to go far; he could not do that, I am
sure."

     "I think not either."

     "Might he not have escaped by means of that ivy, yonder?" said one of 
the
men, pointing to the plant, as it climbed over the coping-stones of the 
wall.

     "Yes; it may be possible," said one; "and yet it is very dangerous, if
not certain destruction to get over."

     "Oh, yes; there is no possibility of escape that way.  Why, it wouldn't
bear a cat, for there are no nails driven into the wall at this height."

     "Never mind," said another, "we may as well leave no stone unturned, as
the saying is, but at once set about looking out for him."

     The individual who spoke now leant over the coping stone, for some
moments, in silence.  He could see nothing, but yet he continued to gaze for
some moments.

     "Do you see him?" inquired  one.

     "No," was the answer.

     "Ay, ay, I thought as much," was the reply.  "He might as well have got
hold of a corner of the moon, which, I believe, is more likely -- a great 
deal
more likely."

     "Hold still a moment," said the man, who was looking over the edge of 
the
house.

     "What's the matter now?  A gnat flew into your eye?"

     "No; but I see him -- by Jove, I see him!"

     "See who -- see who?"

     "Varney, the vampyre!" shouted the man.  "I see him about half-way 
down,
clinging, like a fly to the wall.  Odd zounds!  I never saw the like afore!"

     "Hurrah! after him then, boys!"

     "Not the same way, if you please.  Go yourself, and welcome; but I 
won't
go that way."

     "Just as you please," said the man; "but what's good for the goose is
good for the gander is an old saying, and so is Jack as good as his master."

     "So it may be; but cuss me if you ain't a fool if you attempt that!"

     The man made no reply, but did as Varney had done before, got over the
coping stone, and then laid hold of the ivy; but, whether his weight was
heavier than Varney's, or whether it was that the latter had loosened the 
hold
of the ivy or not, but he had no sooner left go of the coping stone than the
ivy gave way, and he was precipitated from the height of about fifty feet to
the earth -- a dreadful fall!

     There was a pause -- no one spoke.  The man lay motionless and dead -- 
he
had dislocated his neck!

     The fall had not, however, been without its effect upon Varney, for the
man's heels struck him so forcibly on his head as he fell, that he was
stunned, and let go his hold, and he, too, fell to the earth, but not many
feet.

     He soon recovered himself, and was staggering away, when he was 
assailed
by those above with groans, and curses of all kinds, and then by stones, and
tiles, and whatever the mob could lay their hands upon.

     Some of these struck him, and he was cut about in various places, so 
that
he could hardly stand.

     The hoots and shouts of the mob above had now attracted those below to
the spot where Sir Francis Varney was trying to escape, but he had not gone
far before the loud yells of those behind him told him that he was again
pursued.

     Half dead, and almost wholly spent, unarmed, and defenceless, he scarce
knew what to do; whether to fly, or to turn round and die as a refuge from 
the
greater evil of endeavouring to prolong a struggle which seemed hopeless.
Instinct, however, urged him on, at all risks, and though he could not go 
very
far, or fast, yet on he went, with the crowd after him.

     "Down with the vampyre! -- seize him -- hold him -- burn him! he must 
be
down presently, he can't stand!"

     This gave them new hopes, and rendered Varney's fate almost certain. 
They renewed their exertions to overtake him, while he exerted himself anew,
and with surprising agility, considering how he had been employed for more
than two hours.

     There were some trees and hedges now that opposed the progress of both
parties.  The height of Sir Francis Varney gave him a great advantage, and,
had he been fresh, he might have shown it to advantage in vaulting over the
hedges and ditches, which he jumped when obliged, and walked through when he
could.

     Every now and then, the party in pursuit, who had been behind him some
distance, now they gained on him; however, they kept, every now and then,
losing sight of him among the trees and shrubs, and he made direct for a 
small
wood, hoping that when there, he should be able to conceal himself for some
time, so as to throw his pursuers off the track.

     They were well aware of this, for they increased their speed, and one 
or
two swifter of foot than the others, got a-head of them, and cried out aloud
as they ran, --

     "Keep up! keep up! he's making for the wood."

     "He can't stop there long; there are too many of us to beat that cover
without finding our game.  Push, lads, he's our own now, as sure as we know
he's on a-head."

     They did push on, and came in full sight as they saw Sir Francis enter
the wood, with what speed he could make; but he was almost spent.  This was 
a
cheering sight to them, and they were pretty certain he would not leave the
wood in the state he was then -- he must seek concealment.

     However, they were mistaken, for Sir Francis Varney, as soon as he got
into the wood, plunged into the thickest of it, and then paused to gain
breath.

     "So far safe," he muttered; "but I have had a narrow escape; they are 
not
yet done, though, and it will not be safe here long. I must away, and seek
shelter and safety elsewhere, if I can; -- curses on the hounds that run
yelping over the fields!"

     He heard the shouts of his pursuers, and prepared to quit the wood when
he thought the first had entered it.

     "They will remain there some time in beating about," he muttered; "that
is the only chance I have had since the pursuit; curse them! I say again.  I
may now get free; this delay must save my life, but nothing else will."

     He moved away, and, at a slow and lazy pace, left the wood, and then 
made
his way across some fields, towards some cottages that lay on the left.

     The moon yet shone on the fields; he could hear the shouts of the mob, 
as
various parties went through the wood from one covert to another, and yet
unable to find him.

     Then came a great shout upon his ears, as though they had found out he
had left the wood.  This caused him to redouble his speed, and, fearful lest
he should be seen in the moonlight, he leaped over the first fence that he
came to, with almost the last effort that he could make, and then staggered 
in
at an open door -- through a passage -- into a front parlour, and there 
fell,
faint, and utterly spent and speechless, at the feet of Flora Bannerworth.

Next Time:  The Reception of the Vampyre by Flora. -- Varney Subdued.




                              Chapter LXXXVIII.

THE RECEPTION OF THE VAMPYRE BY FLORA. -- VARNEY SUBDUED.


     We must say that the irruption into the house of the Bannerworths by 
Sir
Francis Varney, was certainly unpremeditated by him, for he knew not into
whose house he had thus suddenly rushed for refuge from the numerous foes 
who
were pursing him with such vengeful ire.  It was a strange and singular
incident, and one well calculated to cause the mind to pause before it 
passed
it by, and consider the means to an end which are sometimes as wide of the
mark, as it is in nature possible to be.

     But truth is stronger than fiction by far, and the end of it was, that,
pressed on all sides by danger, bleeding, faint, and exhausted, he rushed 
into
the first house he came to, and thus placed himself in the very house of 
those
whom he had brought to such a state of misfortune.

     Flora Bannerworth was seated at some embroidery, to pass away an hour 
or
so, and thus get over the tedium of time; she was not thinking, either, upon
the unhappy past; some trifling object or other engaged her attention.  But
what was her anguish when she saw a man staggering into the room bleeding, 
and
bearing the marks of a bloody contest, and sinking at her feet.

     He astonishment was far greater yet, when she recognized that man to be
Sir Francis Varney.

     "Save me! -- save me!  Miss Bannerworth, save me! -- only you can save 
me
from the ruthless multitude which follows, crying aloud for my blood."

     As he spoke, he sank down speechless.  Flora was so much amazed, not to
say terrified, that she knew not what to do.  She saw Sir Francis a 
suppliant
at her feet, a fugitive from his enemies, who would show him no mercy -- she
saw all this at a moment's glance; and yet she had not recovered her speech
and presence of mind enough to enable her to make any reply to him.

     "Save me!  Miss Flora Bannerworth, save me!" he again said, raising
himself on his hands.  "I am beset, hunted like a wild beast -- they seek to
destroy my life -- they have pursued me from one spot to another, and I have
unwittingly intruded upon you.  You will save me; I am sure your kindness 
and
goodness of heart will never permit me to be turned out among such a crew of
blood-thirsty butchers as those who pursue me are."

     "Rise, Sir Francis Varney," said Flora, after a moment's hesitation; 
"in
such an extremity as that which you are in, it would be inhuman indeed to
thrust you out among your enemies."

     "Oh! it would," said Varney.  "I had thought, until now, I could have
faced such a mob, until I was in this extremity; and then, disarmed and 
thrown
down, bruised, beaten, and incapable of stemming such a torrent, I fled from
one place to another, till hunted from each, and then instinct alone urged 
me
to greater exertion than before, and here I am -- this is now my last and 
only
hope."

     "Rise, Sir Francis."

     "You will not let me be torn out and slaughtered like an ox.  I am sure
you will not."

     "Sir Francis, we are incapable of such conduct; you have sought refuge
here, and shall find it as far as we are able to afford it to you."

     "And your brother -- and -- "

     "Yes -- yes -- all who are here will do the same; but here they come to
speak for themselves."

     As she spoke, Mrs. Bannerworth entered, also Charles Holland, who both
started on seeing the vampyre present, Sir Francis Varney, who was too weak 
to
rise without assistance.

     "Sir Francis Varney," said Flora, speaking to them as they entered, 
"has
sought refuge here; his life is in peril, and he has no other hope left; you
will, I am sure, do what can be done for him."

     "Mr. Holland," said Sir Francis, "I am, as you may see by my condition, 
a
fugitive, and have been beaten almost to death; instinct alone urged me on 
to
save my life, and I, unknowingly, came in here."

     "Rise, Sir Francis," said Charles Holland; "I am not one who would feel
any pleasure in seeing you become the victim of any brutal mob.  I am sure
there are none amongst us who would willingly do so.  You have trusted to
those who will not betray you."

     "Thank you," said Sir Francis, faintly.  "I thank you; your conduct is
noble, and Miss Bannerworth's especially so."

     "Are you much hurt, Sir Francis?" inquired Charles.

     "I am much hurt, but not seriously or dangerously; but I am weak and
exhausted."

     "Let me assist you to rise," said Charles Holland.

     "Thank you," said Sir Francis, as he accepted of the assistance, and 
when
he stood up, he found how incapable he really was, for a child might have
grappled with him.

     "I have been sore beset, Mrs. Bannerworth," he said, endeavouring to 
bow
to that lady; "and I have suffered much ill- usage.  I am not in such a 
plight
as I could wish to be seen in by ladies; but my reasons for coming will be 
an
excuse for my appearance in such disorder."

     "We will not say anything about that," said Charles Holland; "under the
circumstances, it could not be otherwise."

     "It could not," said Sir Francis, as he took the chair Miss Flora
Bannerworth placed for him.

     "I will not ask you for any explanation as to how this came about; but
you need some restorative and rest."

     "I think I suffer more from exhaustion than anything else. The bruises 
I
have, of course, are not dangerous."

     "Can you step aside a few moments?" said Mrs. Bannerworth. "I will show
you where you can remove some of those stains and make yourself more
comfortable."

     "Thank you, madam -- thank you.  It will be most welcome to me, I 
assure
you."

     Sir Francis rose up, and, with the aid of Charles Holland, he walked to
the next room, where he washed himself, and arranged his dress as well as it
would admit of its being done.

     "Mr. Holland," he said, "I cannot tell you how grateful I feel for 
this. 
I have been hunted from the house where you saw me.  From what source they
learned my abode -- my place of concealment -- I know not; but they found me
out."

     "I need hardly say, Sir Francis, that it could not have occurred 
through
me," said Charles Holland.

     "My young friend," said Sir Francis, "I am quite sure you were not; 
and,
moreover, I never, for one moment, suspected you. No, no; some accidental
circumstance alone has been the cause. I have been very cautious -- I may 
say
extremely so -- but at the same time, living, as I have, surrounded by 
enemies
on all sides, it is not to be wondered at that I should be seen by some one,
and thus traced to my lair, whither they followed me at their leisure."

     "They have been but too troublesome in this matter.  When they become a
little reasonable, it will be a great miracle; for, when their passions and
fears are excited, there is no end to the extremes they will perpetrate."

     "It is so," said Varney, "as the history of these last few days amply
testifies to me.  I could never have credited the extent to which popular
excitement could be carried, and the results it was likely to produce."

     "It is an engine of very difficult control," pursued Charles Holland;
"but what will raise it will not allay it, but add fuel to the fire that 
burns
so fiercely already."

     "True enough," said Sir Francis.

     "If you have done, will you again step this way?"

     Sir Francis Varney followed Charles Holland into the sitting-room, and
sat down with them, and before him was spread a light supper, with some good
wine.

     "Eat, Sir Francis," said Mrs. Bannerworth.  "Such a state as that in
which you are, must, of necessity, produce great exhaustion, and you must
require food and drink."

     Sir Francis bowed as well as he was able, and even then, sore and 
bruised
as he was, fugitive as he had been, he could not forget his courtesy; but it
was not without an effort.  His equanimity was, however, much disturbed, by
finding himself in the midst of the Bannerworths.

     "I owe you a relation," he said, "of what occurred to drive me from my
place of concealment."

     "We should like to hear it, if you are not too far fatigued to relate
it," said Charles.

     "I will.  I was sitting at the top of that house in which I sought to
hide myself, when I heard sounds come that were of a very suspicious nature;
but did not believe that it could happen that they had discovered my 
lurking-
place; far from it; though, of late, I had been habitually cautious and
suspicious, yet I thought I was safe, till I heard the noise of a multitude
coming towards me.  I could not be mistaken in it, for the sounds are so
peculiar that they are like nothing else.  I heard them coming.

     "I moved not; and when they surrounded the house as far as was
practicable, they gave an immense shout, and made the welkin ring with the
sound."

     "I heard a confused noise at a distance," remarked Flora; "but I had no
idea that anything serious was contemplated.  I imagined it was some 
festival
among some trade, or portion of the townspeople, who were shouting from 
joy."

     "Oh, dear, no," said Sir Francis; "but I am not surprised at the 
mistake,
because there are such occurrences occasionally; but whenever the mob gained
any advantage upon me they shouted, and when I was able to oppose them with
effect, they groaned at me most horribly."

     "The deuce," said Charles; "the sound, I suppose, serves to express 
their
feelings, and to encourage each other."

     "Something of the sort, I dare say," said Varney; "but at length, after
defending the house with all the desperation that despair imparted to me, I
was compelled to fly from floor to floor, until I had reached the roof; 
there
they followed me, and I was compelled again to fly.  House after house they
followed me to, until I could go no farther," said Varney.

     "How did you escape?"

     "Fortunately I saw some ivy growing and creeping over the coping-
stones,
and by grasping that I got over the side, and so let myself down by degrees,
as well as I was able."

     "Good heavens! what a dreadful situation," exclaimed Flora; "it is 
really
horrible!"

     "I could not do it again, under, I think, any circumstances."

     "Not the same?" said Mrs. Bannerworth.

     "I really doubt if I could," said Varney.  "The truth is, the 
excitement
of the moment was great, and I at that moment thought of nothing but getting
away.

     "The same circumstances, the same fear of death, could hardly be 
produced
in me again, and I am unable to account for the phenomenon on this 
occasion."

     "Your escape was very narrow indeed," said Flora; "it makes me shudder 
to
think of the dangers you have gone through; it is really terrible to think 
of
it."

     "You," said Sir Francis, "are young and susceptible, and generous in 
your
disposition.  You can feel for me, and do; but how little I could have
expected it, it is impossible to say; but your sympathy sinks into my mind,
and causes such emotions as never can be erased from my soul.

     "But to proceed.  You may guess how dreadful was my position, by the 
fact
that the first man who attempted to get over tore the ivy away and fell,
striking me in his fall; he was killed, and I thrown down and stunned, I 
then
made for the wood, closely pursued, and got into it; then I baffled them: 
they
searched the wood, and I went through it.  I then ran across the country to
these houses here; I got over the fence, and in at the back door."

     "Did they see you come?" inquired Charles Holland.

     "I cannot say, but I think that they did not; I heard them give a loud
shout more than once when on this side of the wood."

     "You did?  How far from here were you when you heard the shouts?"
inquired Mrs. Bannerworth.

     "I was close here; and, as I jumped over the fence, I heard them shout
again; but I think they cannot see so far; the night was moonlight, to be
sure, but that is all; the shadow of the hedge, and the distance together,
would make it, if not impossible, at least very improbable."

     "That is very likely," said Mrs. Bannerworth.

     "In that case," said Charles Holland, "you are safe here; for none will
suspect your being concealed here."

     "It is the last place I should myself have thought of," said Varney; 
"and
I may say the last place I would knowingly have come to; but had I before
known enough of you, I should have been well assured of your generosity, and
have freely come to claim your aid and shelter, which accident has so
strangely brought me to be a candidate for, and which you have so kindly
awarded me."

     "The night is wearing away," said Flora, "and Sir Francis is doubtless
fatigued to an excess; sleep, I dare say, will be most welcome to him."

     "It will indeed, Miss Bannerworth," said Varney; "but I can do that 
under
any circumstances; do not let me put you to any inconvenience; a chair, and 
at
any hour, will serve me for sleep."

     "We cannot do for you what we would wish," said Flora, looking at her
mother; "but something better than that, at all events, we can and will
provide for you."

     "I know not how to thank you," said Sir Francis Varney; "I assure you, 
of
late I have not been luxuriously lodged, and the less trouble I give you the
greater I shall esteem the favour."

     The hour was late, and Sir Francis Varney, before another hour had
elapsed, was consigned to his own reflections, in a small but neat room, 
there
to repose his bruised and battered carcass, and court the refreshing 
influence
of sleep.

     His reflections were, for nearly  an hour, of the most contradictory
character; some one passion was trying to overcome the other; but he seemed
quite subdued.

     "I could not have expected this," he muttered; "Flora Bannerworth has 
the
soul of a heroine.  I deserved not such a reception from them; and yet, in 
my
hour of utmost need, they have received me like a favoured friend; and yet 
all
their misfortunes have taken their origin from me; I am the cause of all."

     Filled with these thoughts, he fell asleep; he slept undisturbed; it
seemed as though the influence of sleep was sweeter far there, in the 
cottage
of the Bannerworths, than ever he had before received.

     It was late on that morning before Sir Francis rose, and then only
through hearing the family about, and, having performed his toilet, so far 
as
circumstances permitted, he descended,and entered the front-parlour, the 
room
he had been in the night before.

     Flora Bannerworth was already there; indeed, breakfast was waiting the
appearance of Sir Francis Varney.

     "Good morning, Sir Francis," said Flora, rising to receive him; and she
could not avoid looking at him as he entered the room.  "I hope you have had 
a
pleasant night."

     "It has been the best night's rest I have had for some time, Miss
Bannerworth.  I assure you I have to express my gratitude to you for so much
kindness.  I have slept well, and soundly."

     "I am glad to hear it."

     "I think yet I shall escape the search of these people who have hunted 
me
from so many places."

     "I hope you may, indeed, Sir Francis."

     "You, Miss Bannerworth! and do you hope that I may escape the vengeance
of these people -- the populace?"

     "I do, Sir Francis, most sincerely hope so.  Why should I wish evil to
you, especially at their hands?"

     Sir Francis did not speak for a minute or two, and then he said, 
turning
full upon Flora --

     "I don't know why, Miss Bannerworth, that I should think so, but 
perhaps
it is because there are peculiar circumstances connected with myself, that
have made me feel conscious that I have not deserved so much goodness at 
your
hands."

     "You have not deserved any evil.  Sir Francis, we could not do that if 
it
were in our power; we would do you a service at any time."

     "You have done so, Miss Bannerworth -- the greatest that can be
performed.  You have saved my life."

     At that moment Charles Holland entered, and Sir Francis bowed, as he
said, --

     "I hope you, Mr. Holland, have slept as well, and passed as good a 
night
as I have passed?"

     "I am glad you, at least, have passed a quiet one," said Charles 
Holland;
"you, I dare say, feel all the better for it? How do you feel yourself?  Are
you much hurt?"

     "Not at all, not at all," said Sir Francis Varney.  "Only a few 
bruises,
and so forth, some of which, as you may perceive, do not add to one's 
personal
appearance.  A week or two's quiet would rid me of them.  At all events, I
would it may do the same with my enemies."

     "I wish they were as easily gotten rid of myself," said Charles; "but 
as
that cannot be, we must endeavour to baffle them in the best way we may."

     "I owe a debt to your I shall never be able to repay; but where there 
is
a will, they say there is a way; and if the old saying be good for anything, 
I
need not despair, though the way is by no means apparent at present."

     "Time is the magician," said Flora, "whose wand changes all things -- 
the
young to the aged, and the aged to nothing."

     "Certainly, that is true," said Varney, "and many such changes have I
seen.  My mind is stored with such events; but this is sadness, and I have
cause to rejoice."

     The breakfast was passed off in pleasing conversation, and Varney found
himself much at home with the Bannerworths, whose calm and even tenour was
quite new to him.

     He could not but admit the charms of such a life as that led by the
Bannerworths; but what it must have been when they were supplied with ample
means, with nothing to prey upon their minds, and no fearful mystery to hang
on and weigh down their spirits, he could scarcely imagine.

     They were amiable, accomplished; they were in the same mind at all 
times,
and nothing seemed to ruffle them; and when night came, he could not but
acknowledge to himself that he had never formed half the opinion of them 
they
were deserving of.

     Of course during that day he was compelled to lie close, so as not to 
be
seen by any one, save the family.  He sat in a small room, which was
overlooked by no other in the neighbourhood, and he remained quiet, 
sometimes
conversing, and sometimes reading, but at the same time ever attentive to 
the
least sound that appeared at all of a character to indicate the approach of
persons for any purpose whatever.

     At supper time he spoke to Flora, and to Charles Holland, saying, --

     "There are certain matters connected with myself -- I may say with you
now -- sure all that has happened will make it so -- of which you would be
glad to hear something."

     "You mean upon the same subject upon which I had some conversation with
you a day or two back?"

     "Yes, the same.  Allow me one week, and you shall know all. I will then
relate to you that which you so much desire to know -- one week, and all 
shall
be told."

     "Well," said Charles Holland, "this has not been exacted from you as 
the
price of your safety, but you can choose your own time, of course; what you
promise is most desired, for it will render those happy who now are much 
worse
than they were before these occurrences took place."

     "I am aware of all that; grant me but one week, and then you shall be
made acquainted with all."

     "I am satisfied, Sir Francis," said Flora; "but while here under our
roof, we should never have asked you a question."

     "Of this, Miss Bannerworth, the little I have seen of you assures me 
you
would not do so; however, I am the more inclined to make it -- I am under so
deep an obligation to you all, that I can never repay it."

     Sir Francis Varney retired to rest that night -- his promise to the
Bannerworths filled his mind with many reflections -- the insecurity of his
own position, and the frail tenure which even he held in the hands of those
whom he had most injured.

     This produced a series of reflections of a grave and melancholy nature,
and he sat by his window, watching the progress of the clouds, as they
appeared to chase each other over the face of the scene -- now casting a 
shade
over the earth, and then banishing the shadows, and throwing a gentle light
over the earth's surface, which was again chased away, and shadows again 
fell
upon the scene below.

     How long he had sat there in melancholy musing he knew not; but 
suddenly
he was aroused from his dreams by a voice that shook the skies, and caused 
him
to start to his feet.

     "Hurrah! -- hurrah! -- hurrah!" shouted the mob, which had silently
collected around the cottage of the Bannerworths.

     "Curses!" muttered Sir Francis, as he again sank in his chair, and 
struck
his head with his hand.  "I am hunted to death -- they will not leave me 
until
my body has graced a cross- road."

     "Hurrah! -- down with the vampyre -- pull him out!"

     Then came an instant knocking at the doors, and the people on the 
outside
made a great din, that it seemed as though they contemplated knocking the
house down at once, without warning the inmates that they waited there.

     There was a cessation for about a minute, when one of the family 
hastened
to the door, and inquired what was wanted.

     "Varney, the vampyre," was the reply.

     "You must seek him elsewhere."

     "We will search this place before we go further," replied a man.

     "But he is not here."

     "We have reason to believe otherwise.  Open the door, and let us in -- 
no
one shall be hurt, or one single object in the house, but we must come in, 
and
search for the vampyre."

     "Come to-morrow, then."

     "That will not do," said the voice; "open, or we force our way in 
without
more notice."

     At the same a tremendous blow was bestowed upon the door, and then much
force was used to thrust it in.  A consultation was suddenly held among the
inmates as to what was to be done, but no one could advise, and each was 
well
aware of the utter impossibility of keeping the mob out.

     "I do not see what is to become of me," said Sir Francis Varney, 
suddenly
appearing before them.  "You must let them in; there is no chance of keeping
them out, neither can you conceal me.  You will have no place, save one, 
that
will be sacred from their profanation."

     "And what is that?"

     "Flora's own room."

     All started at the thought that Flora's chamber could in any way be
profaned by any such presence as Sir Francis Varney's.

     However, the doors below were suddenly burst open, amid loud cries 
front
the populace, who rushed in in great numbers, and began to search the lower
rooms, immediately.

     "All is lost!" said Sir Francis Varney, as he dashed away and rushed to
the chamber of Flora, who, alarmed at the sounds that were now filling the
house, stood listening to them.

     "Miss Bannerworth -- " began Varney.

     "Sir Francis!"

     "Yes, it is I, Miss Bannerworth.  Hear me, for one moment."

     "What is the matter?"

     "I am again in peril -- in more imminent peril than before; my life is
not worth a minute's purchase, unless you save me. You, and alone, can now
save me.  Oh! Miss Bannerworth, if ever pity touched your heart, save me 
from
those only whom I now fear.  I could meet death in any shape but that in 
which
they will inflict it upon me.  Hear their execrations below!"

     "Death to the vampyre! death to Varney! burn him! run a stake through 
his
body!"

     "What can I do, Sir Francis?"

     "Admit me to your chamber."

     "Sir Francis, are you aware of what you are saying?"

     "I am well.  It is a request which you would justly scorn to reply to;
but now my life -- recollect you have saved me once -- my life; -- do now 
now
throw away the boon you have so kindly bestowed.  Save me, Miss 
Bannerworth."

     "It is not possible.  I -- "

     "Nay, Miss Bannerworth, do you imagine this is a time for ceremony, or
the observances of polished life?  On my honour, you run no risk of 
censure."

     "Where is Varney?  Where is the vampyre?  He ain't far off."

     "Hear -- hear them, Miss Bannerworth.  They are now at the foot of the
stairs.  Not a moment to lose.  One minute more, and I am in the hands of a
crew that has no mercy."

     "Hurrah! upstairs.  He's not below.  Upstairs, neighbours; we shall 
have
him yet."

     These words sounded on the stairs; half-a-dozen more steps, and Varney
would be seen.  It was a miracle he was not heard begging for his life.

     Varney cast a look of despair at the stairhead and felt for his sword,
but it was not there; he had lost it.  He struck his head with his clenched
hand, and was about to rush upon his foes, when he heard the lock turn; he
looked, and saw the door opened gently, and Flora stood there; he passed in,
and sank cowering into a chair, at the other end of the room, behind some
curtains.

     The door was scarcely shut ere some tried to force it, and then a loud
knocking came at the door.

     "Open! open! we want Varney, the vampyre.  Open! or we will burst it
open."

     Flora did open it, but stood resolutely in the opening, and held up her
hand to impose silence.

     "Are you men, that you can come thus to force yourselves upon the 
privacy
of a female?  Is there nothing in the town or house, that you must intrude 
in
numbers into a private apartment?  Is no place sacred from you?"

     "But, ma'am -- miss -- we only want Varney, the vampyre."

     "And can you find him nowhere but in a female's bedroom? Shame on you!
shame on you!  Have you no sisters, wives, or mothers, that you act thus?"

     "He's not in there, you may be sure of that, Jack," said a gruff voice. 
"Let the lady be in quiet; she's had quite enough trouble with him to sicken
her of a vampyre.  You may be sure that's the last place to find him in."

     With this they all turned away, and Flora shut the door and locked it
upon them, and Varney was safe.

     "You have saved me," said Varney.

     "Hush!" said Flora.  "Speak not; there may be some one listening."

     Sir Francis Varney stood in the attitude of one listening most 
anxiously
to catch some sounds; the moon fell across his face, and gave it a ghastly
hue, that, added to his natural paleness and wounds, gave him an almost
unearthly aspect.

     The sounds grew more and more distant; the shouts and noise of men
traversing the apartments subsided, and gradually the place became restored 
to
its original silence.  The mob, after having searched every other part of 
the
house, and not finding the object of their search, they concluded that he 
was
not there, but must have made his escape before.

     We must say that the irruption into the house of the Bannerworths by 
Sir
Francis Varney, was certainly unpremeditated by him, for he knew not into
whose house he had thus suddenly rushed for refuge from the numerous foes 
who
were pursing him with such vengeful ire.  It was a strange and singular
incident, and one well calculated to cause the mind to pause before it 
passed
it by, and consider the means to an end which are sometimes as wide of the
mark, as it is in nature possible to be.

     But truth is stronger than fiction by far, and the end of it was, that,
pressed on all sides by danger, bleeding, faint, and exhausted, he rushed 
into
the first house he came to, and thus placed himself in the very house of 
those
whom he had brought to such a state of misfortune.

     Flora Bannerworth was seated at some embroidery, to pass away an hour 
or
so, and thus get over the tedium of time; she was not thinking, either, upon
the unhappy past; some trifling object or other engaged her attention.  But
what was her anguish when she saw a man staggering into the room bleeding, 
and
bearing the marks of a bloody contest, and sinking at her feet.

     He astonishment was far greater yet, when she recognized that man to be
Sir Francis Varney.

     "Save me! -- save me!  Miss Bannerworth, save me! -- only you can save 
me
from the ruthless multitude which follows, crying aloud for my blood."

     As he spoke, he sank down speechless.  Flora was so much amazed, not to
say terrified, that she knew not what to do.  She saw Sir Francis a 
suppliant
at her feet, a fugitive from his enemies, who would show him no mercy -- she
saw all this at a moment's glance; and yet she had not recovered her speech
and presence of mind enough to enable her to make any reply to him.

     "Save me!  Miss Flora Bannerworth, save me!" he again said, raising
himself on his hands.  "I am beset, hunted like a wild beast -- they seek to
destroy my life -- they have pursued me from one spot to another, and I have
unwittingly intruded upon you.  You will save me; I am sure your kindness 
and
goodness of heart will never permit me to be turned out among such a crew of
blood-thirsty butchers as those who pursue me are."

     "Rise, Sir Francis Varney," said Flora, after a moment's hesitation; 
"in
such an extremity as that which you are in, it would be inhuman indeed to
thrust you out among your enemies."

     "Oh! it would," said Varney.  "I had thought, until now, I could have
faced such a mob, until I was in this extremity; and then, disarmed and 
thrown
down, bruised, beaten, and incapable of stemming such a torrent, I fled from
one place to another, till hunted from each, and then instinct alone urged 
me
to greater exertion than before, and here I am -- this is now my last and 
only
hope."

     "Rise, Sir Francis."

     "You will not let me be torn out and slaughtered like an ox.  I am sure
you will not."

     "Sir Francis, we are incapable of such conduct; you have sought refuge
here, and shall find it as far as we are able to afford it to you."

     "And your brother -- and -- "

     "Yes -- yes -- all who are here will do the same; but here they come to
speak for themselves."

     As she spoke, Mrs. Bannerworth entered, also Charles Holland, who both
started on seeing the vampyre present, Sir Francis Varney, who was too weak 
to
rise without assistance.

     "Sir Francis Varney," said Flora, speaking to them as they entered, 
"has
sought refuge here; his life is in peril, and he has no other hope left; you
will, I am sure, do what can be done for him."

     "Mr. Holland," said Sir Francis, "I am, as you may see by my condition, 
a
fugitive, and have been beaten almost to death; instinct alone urged me on 
to
save my life, and I, unknowingly, came in here."

     "Rise, Sir Francis," said Charles Holland; "I am not one who would feel
any pleasure in seeing you become the victim of any brutal mob.  I am sure
there are none amongst us who would willingly do so.  You have trusted to
those who will not betray you."

     "Thank you," said Sir Francis, faintly.  "I thank you; your conduct is
noble, and Miss Bannerworth's especially so."

     "Are you much hurt, Sir Francis?" inquired Charles.

     "I am much hurt, but not seriously or dangerously; but I am weak and
exhausted."

     "Let me assist you to rise," said Charles Holland.

     "Thank you," said Sir Francis, as he accepted of the assistance, and 
when
he stood up, he found how incapable he really was, for a child might have
grappled with him.

     "I have been sore beset, Mrs. Bannerworth," he said, endeavouring to 
bow
to that lady; "and I have suffered much ill- usage.  I am not in such a 
plight
as I could wish to be seen in by ladies; but my reasons for coming will be 
an
excuse for my appearance in such disorder."

     "We will not say anything about that," said Charles Holland; "under the
circumstances, it could not be otherwise."

     "It could not," said Sir Francis, as he took the chair Miss Flora
Bannerworth placed for him.

     "I will not ask you for any explanation as to how this came about; but
you need some restorative and rest."

     "I think I suffer more from exhaustion than anything else. The bruises 
I
have, of course, are not dangerous."

     "Can you step aside a few moments?" said Mrs. Bannerworth. "I will show
you where you can remove some of those stains and make yourself more
comfortable."

     "Thank you, madam -- thank you.  It will be most welcome to me, I 
assure
you."

     Sir Francis rose up, and, with the aid of Charles Holland, he walked to
the next room, where he washed himself, and arranged his dress as well as it
would admit of its being done.

     "Mr. Holland," he said, "I cannot tell you how grateful I feel for 
this. 
I have been hunted from the house where you saw me.  From what source they
learned my abode -- my place of concealment -- I know not; but they found me
out."

     "I need hardly say, Sir Francis, that it could not have occurred 
through
me," said Charles Holland.

     "My young friend," said Sir Francis, "I am quite sure you were not; 
and,
moreover, I never, for one moment, suspected you. No, no; some accidental
circumstance alone has been the cause. I have been very cautious -- I may 
say
extremely so -- but at the same time, living, as I have, surrounded by 
enemies
on all sides, it is not to be wondered at that I should be seen by some one,
and thus traced to my lair, whither they followed me at their leisure."

     "They have been but too troublesome in this matter.  When they become a
little reasonable, it will be a great miracle; for, when their passions and
fears are excited, there is no end to the extremes they will perpetrate."

     "It is so," said Varney, "as the history of these last few days amply
testifies to me.  I could never have credited the extent to which popular
excitement could be carried, and the results it was likely to produce."

     "It is an engine of very difficult control," pursued Charles Holland;
"but what will raise it will not allay it, but add fuel to the fire that 
burns
so fiercely already."

     "True enough," said Sir Francis.

     "If you have done, will you again step this way?"

     Sir Francis Varney followed Charles Holland into the sitting-room, and
sat down with them, and before him was spread a light supper, with some good
wine.

     "Eat, Sir Francis," said Mrs. Bannerworth.  "Such a state as that in
which you are, must, of necessity, produce great exhaustion, and you must
require food and drink."

     Sir Francis bowed as well as he was able, and even then, sore and 
bruised
as he was, fugitive as he had been, he could not forget his courtesy; but it
was not without an effort.  His equanimity was, however, much disturbed, by
finding himself in the midst of the Bannerworths.

     "I owe you a relation," he said, "of what occurred to drive me from my
place of concealment."

     "We should like to hear it, if you are not too far fatigued to relate
it," said Charles.

     "I will.  I was sitting at the top of that house in which I sought to
hide myself, when I heard sounds come that were of a very suspicious nature;
but did not believe that it could happen that they had discovered my 
lurking-
place; far from it; though, of late, I had been habitually cautious and
suspicious, yet I thought I was safe, till I heard the noise of a multitude
coming towards me.  I could not be mistaken in it, for the sounds are so
peculiar that they are like nothing else.  I heard them coming.

     "I moved not; and when they surrounded the house as far as was
practicable, they gave an immense shout, and made the welkin ring with the
sound."

     "I heard a confused noise at a distance," remarked Flora; "but I had no
idea that anything serious was contemplated.  I imagined it was some 
festival
among some trade, or portion of the townspeople, who were shouting from 
joy."

     "Oh, dear, no," said Sir Francis; "but I am not surprised at the 
mistake,
because there are such occurrences occasionally; but whenever the mob gained
any advantage upon me they shouted, and when I was able to oppose them with
effect, they groaned at me most horribly."

     "The deuce," said Charles; "the sound, I suppose, serves to express 
their
feelings, and to encourage each other."

     "Something of the sort, I dare say," said Varney; "but at length, after
defending the house with all the desperation that despair imparted to me, I
was compelled to fly from floor to floor, until I had reached the roof; 
there
they followed me, and I was compelled again to fly.  House after house they
followed me to, until I could go no farther," said Varney.

     "How did you escape?"

     "Fortunately I saw some ivy growing and creeping over the coping-
stones,
and by grasping that I got over the side, and so let myself down by degrees,
as well as I was able."

     "Good heavens! what a dreadful situation," exclaimed Flora; "it is 
really
horrible!"

     "I could not do it again, under, I think, any circumstances."

     "Not the same?" said Mrs. Bannerworth.

     "I really doubt if I could," said Varney.  "The truth is, the 
excitement
of the moment was great, and I at that moment thought of nothing but getting
away.

     "The same circumstances, the same fear of death, could hardly be 
produced
in me again, and I am unable to account for the phenomenon on this 
occasion."

     "Your escape was very narrow indeed," said Flora; "it makes me shudder 
to
think of the dangers you have gone through; it is really terrible to think 
of
it."

     "You," said Sir Francis, "are young and susceptible, and generous in 
your
disposition.  You can feel for me, and do; but how little I could have
expected it, it is impossible to say; but your sympathy sinks into my mind,
and causes such emotions as never can be erased from my soul.

     "But to proceed.  You may guess how dreadful was my position, by the 
fact
that the first man who attempted to get over tore the ivy away and fell,
striking me in his fall; he was killed, and I thrown down and stunned, I 
then
made for the wood, closely pursued, and got into it; then I baffled them: 
they
searched the wood, and I went through it.  I then ran across the country to
these houses here; I got over the fence, and in at the back door."

     "Did they see you come?" inquired Charles Holland.

     "I cannot say, but I think that they did not; I heard them give a loud
shout more than once when on this side of the wood."

     "You did?  How far from here were you when you heard the shouts?"
inquired Mrs. Bannerworth.

     "I was close here; and, as I jumped over the fence, I heard them shout
again; but I think they cannot see so far; the night was moonlight, to be
sure, but that is all; the shadow of the hedge, and the distance together,
would make it, if not impossible, at least very improbable."

     "That is very likely," said Mrs. Bannerworth.

     "In that case," said Charles Holland, "you are safe here; for none will
suspect your being concealed here."

     "It is the last place I should myself have thought of," said Varney; 
"and
I may say the last place I would knowingly have come to; but had I before
known enough of you, I should have been well assured of your generosity, and
have freely come to claim your aid and shelter, which accident has so
strangely brought me to be a candidate for, and which you have so kindly
awarded me."

     "The night is wearing away," said Flora, "and Sir Francis is doubtless
fatigued to an excess; sleep, I dare say, will be most welcome to him."

     "It will indeed, Miss Bannerworth," said Varney; "but I can do that 
under
any circumstances; do not let me put you to any inconvenience; a chair, and 
at
any hour, will serve me for sleep."

     "We cannot do for you what we would wish," said Flora, looking at her
mother; "but something better than that, at all events, we can and will
provide for you."

     "I know not how to thank you," said Sir Francis Varney; "I assure you, 
of
late I have not been luxuriously lodged, and the less trouble I give you the
greater I shall esteem the favour."

     The hour was late, and Sir Francis Varney, before another hour had
elapsed, was consigned to his own reflections, in a small but neat room, 
there
to repose his bruised and battered carcass, and court the refreshing 
influence
of sleep.

     His reflections were, for nearly  an hour, of the most contradictory
character; some one passion was trying to overcome the other; but he seemed
quite subdued.

     "I could not have expected this," he muttered; "Flora Bannerworth has 
the
soul of a heroine.  I deserved not such a reception from them; and yet, in 
my
hour of utmost need, they have received me like a favoured friend; and yet 
all
their misfortunes have taken their origin from me; I am the cause of all."

     Filled with these thoughts, he fell asleep; he slept undisturbed; it
seemed as though the influence of sleep was sweeter far there, in the 
cottage
of the Bannerworths, than ever he had before received.

     It was late on that morning before Sir Francis rose, and then only
through hearing the family about, and, having performed his toilet, so far 
as
circumstances permitted, he descended,and entered the front-parlour, the 
room
he had been in the night before.

     Flora Bannerworth was already there; indeed, breakfast was waiting the
appearance of Sir Francis Varney.

     "Good morning, Sir Francis," said Flora, rising to receive him; and she
could not avoid looking at him as he entered the room.  "I hope you have had 
a
pleasant night."

     "It has been the best night's rest I have had for some time, Miss
Bannerworth.  I assure you I have to express my gratitude to you for so much
kindness.  I have slept well, and soundly."

     "I am glad to hear it."

     "I think yet I shall escape the search of these people who have hunted 
me
from so many places."

     "I hope you may, indeed, Sir Francis."

     "You, Miss Bannerworth! and do you hope that I may escape the vengeance
of these people -- the populace?"

     "I do, Sir Francis, most sincerely hope so.  Why should I wish evil to
you, especially at their hands?"

     Sir Francis did not speak for a minute or two, and then he said, 
turning
full upon Flora --

     "I don't know why, Miss Bannerworth, that I should think so, but 
perhaps
it is because there are peculiar circumstances connected with myself, that
have made me feel conscious that I have not deserved so much goodness at 
your
hands."

     "You have not deserved any evil.  Sir Francis, we could not do that if 
it
were in our power; we would do you a service at any time."

     "You have done so, Miss Bannerworth -- the greatest that can be
performed.  You have saved my life."

     At that moment Charles Holland entered, and Sir Francis bowed, as he
said, --

     "I hope you, Mr. Holland, have slept as well, and passed as good a 
night
as I have passed?"

     "I am glad you, at least, have passed a quiet one," said Charles 
Holland;
"you, I dare say, feel all the better for it? How do you feel yourself?  Are
you much hurt?"

     "Not at all, not at all," said Sir Francis Varney.  "Only a few 
bruises,
and so forth, some of which, as you may perceive, do not add to one's 
personal
appearance.  A week or two's quiet would rid me of them.  At all events, I
would it may do the same with my enemies."

     "I wish they were as easily gotten rid of myself," said Charles; "but 
as
that cannot be, we must endeavour to baffle them in the best way we may."

     "I owe a debt to your I shall never be able to repay; but where there 
is
a will, they say there is a way; and if the old saying be good for anything, 
I
need not despair, though the way is by no means apparent at present."

     "Time is the magician," said Flora, "whose wand changes all things -- 
the
young to the aged, and the aged to nothing."

     "Certainly, that is true," said Varney, "and many such changes have I
seen.  My mind is stored with such events; but this is sadness, and I have
cause to rejoice."

     The breakfast was passed off in pleasing conversation, and Varney found
himself much at home with the Bannerworths, whose calm and even tenour was
quite new to him.

     He could not but admit the charms of such a life as that led by the
Bannerworths; but what it must have been when they were supplied with ample
means, with nothing to prey upon their minds, and no fearful mystery to hang
on and weigh down their spirits, he could scarcely imagine.

     They were amiable, accomplished; they were in the same mind at all 
times,
and nothing seemed to ruffle them; and when night came, he could not but
acknowledge to himself that he had never formed half the opinion of them 
they
were deserving of.

     Of course during that day he was compelled to lie close, so as not to 
be
seen by any one, save the family.  He sat in a small room, which was
overlooked by no other in the neighbourhood, and he remained quiet, 
sometimes
conversing, and sometimes reading, but at the same time ever attentive to 
the
least sound that appeared at all of a character to indicate the approach of
persons for any purpose whatever.

     At supper time he spoke to Flora, and to Charles Holland, saying, --

     "There are certain matters connected with myself -- I may say with you
now -- sure all that has happened will make it so -- of which you would be
glad to hear something."

     "You mean upon the same subject upon which I had some conversation with
you a day or two back?"

     "Yes, the same.  Allow me one week, and you shall know all. I will then
relate to you that which you so much desire to know -- one week, and all 
shall
be told."

     "Well," said Charles Holland, "this has not been exacted from you as 
the
price of your safety, but you can choose your own time, of course; what you
promise is most desired, for it will render those happy who now are much 
worse
than they were before these occurrences took place."

     "I am aware of all that; grant me but one week, and then you shall be
made acquainted with all."

     "I am satisfied, Sir Francis," said Flora; "but while here under our
roof, we should never have asked you a question."

     "Of this, Miss Bannerworth, the little I have seen of you assures me 
you
would not do so; however, I am the more inclined to make it -- I am under so
deep an obligation to you all, that I can never repay it."

                      *         *         *         *

     The most desperate peril of Sir Francis Varney seemed to have more 
effect
upon him than anything that had occurred during his most strange and most
eventful career.

     When he was assured that the riotous mod [sic] that had been so intent
upon his destruction was gone, and that he might emerge from his place of
concealment, he did so with an appearance of such utter exhaustion that the
Bannerworth family could not but look upon him as a being who was near his
end.

     At any time his countenance, as we long have had occasion to remark, 
was
a strange and unearthly looking one; but when we come to superadd to the
strangeness of his ordinary appearance the traces of deep mental emotion, we
may well say that Varney's appearance was positively of the most alarming
character.

     When he was seated in the ordinary sitting apartment of the 
Bannerworths,
he drew a long sighing breath, and placing his hand upon his heart, he said,
in a faint tone of voice, --

     "It beats now laboriously, but it will soon cease its pulsations for
ever."

     These words sounded absolutely prophetic, there was about them such a
solemn aspect, and he looked at the same time that he uttered them so much
like one whose mortal race was run, and who was now a candidate for the 
grave.

     "Do not speak so despairingly," said Charles Holland; "remember, that 
if
your life has been one of errors hitherto, how short a space of time may
suffice to redeem some of them at least, and the communication to me which 
you
have not yet completed may to some extent have such an effect."

     "No, no.  It may contribute to an act of justice, but it can do no good
to me.  And yet do not suppose that because such is my impression that I 
mean
to hesitate in finishing to you that communication."

     "I rejoice to hear you say so, and if you would, now that you must be
aware of what good feelings towards you we are all animated with, remove the
bar of secrecy from the communication, I should esteem it a great favour."

     Varney appeared to be considering for a few moments, and then he said, 
--

     "Well, well.  Let the secrecy no longer exist.  Have it removed at 
once. 
I will no longer seek to maintain it.  Tell all, Charles Holland-- tell 
all."

     Thus empowered by the mysterious being, Charles Holland related briefly
what Varney had already told him, and then concluded by saying, --

     "That is all that I have myself as yet been made aware of, and I now 
call
upon Sir Francis Varney to finish his narration."

     "I am weak," said Varney, "and scarcely equal to the task; but yet I 
will
not shrink from the promise that I have made.  You have been the preservers 
of
my life, and more particularly to you, Flora Bannerworth, am I indebted for 
a
continued existence, which otherwise must have been sacrificed upon the 
altar
or superstition."

     "But you will recollect, Master Varney," said the admiral, who had sat
looking on for some time in silent wonder, "you must recollect, Master 
Varney,
that the people are, after all, not so much to blame for their superstition,
because, whether you are a vampyre or not, and I don't pretend to come to a
positive opinion now, you took good care to persuade them you were."

     "I did," said Varney, with a shudder; "but why did I?"

     "Well, you know best."

     "It was, then, because I did believe, and do believe, that there is
something more than natural about my strangely protracted existence; but we
will waive that point, and, before my failing strength, for it appears to me
to be failing, completely prevents me from doing so, let me relate to you 
the
continued particulars of the circumstances that made me what I am."

     Flora Bannerworth, although she had heard before from the lips of 
Charles
Holland the to her dreadful fact, that her father, in addition to having 
laid
violent hands upon his own life, was a murderer, now that that fearful
circumstance was related more publicly, felt a greater pang than she had 
done
when it was whispered to her in the accents of pure affection, and softened
down by a gentleness of tone, which Charles Holland's natural delicacy would
not allow him to use even to her whom he loved so well in the presence of
others.

     She let her beautiful face be hidden by her hands, and she wept as she
listened to the sad detail.

     Varney looked inquiringly in the countenance of Charles Holland, 
because,
having given him leave to make Flora acquainted with the circumstance, he 
was
rather surprised at the amount of emotion which it produced in her.

     Charles Holland answered the appealing look by saying, --

     "Flora is already aware of the facts, but it naturally affects her much
to hear them now repeated in the presence of others, and those too, towards
whom she cannot feel---"

     What Charles Holland was going to say was abruptly stopped short by the
admiral, who interposed, exclaiming, --

     "Why, what do you mean, you son of a sea cook?  The presence of who do
you mean?  Do you mean to say that I don't feel for Miss Flora, bless her
heart! quite as much as a white-faced looking swab like you?  Why I shall
begin to think you are only fit for a marine."

     "Nay, uncle, now do not put yourself out of temper.  You must be well
aware that I could not mean anything disrespectful to you.  You should not
suppose such a state of things possible; and although, perhaps, I did not
express myself so felicitously as I might, yet what I intended to say, was, 
---
"

     "Oh, bother what you intended to say.  You go on, Mr. Vampyre, with 
your
story.  I want to know what became of it all; just you get on as quick as 
you
can, and let us know what you did after the man was murdered."

     "When the dreadful deed was committed," said Varney, "and our victim 
lay
weltering in his blood, and had breathed his last, we stood like men who for
the first time were awakened to the frightful consequences of what they had
done.

     "I saw by the dim light that hovered round us a great change come over
the countenance of Marmaduke Bannerworth, and he shook in every limb.

     "This soon passed away, however, and the powerful and urgent necessity
which arose of avoiding the consequences of the deed that we had done,
restored us to ourselves.  We stooped and took from the body the ill-gotten
gains of the gambler.  They amounted to an immense sum, and I said to
Marmaduke Bannerworth, --

     "'Take you the whole of this money and proceed to your own home with 
it,
where you will be least suspected.  Hide it in some place of great secrecy,
and to-morrow I will call upon you, when we will divide it, and will 
consider
of some means of safely exchanging the notes for gold.'

     "He agreed to this, and placed the money in his pocket, after which it
became necessary that we should dispose of the body, which, if we did not
quickly remove, must in a few hours be discovered, and so, perchance,
accompanied by other criminating circumstances, become a frightful evidence
against us, and entail upon us all those consequences of the deed which we
were so truly anxious to escape from.

     "It is ever the worst part of the murderer's task, that after he has
struck the blow that has deprived his victim of existence, it becomes his
frightful duty to secrete the corpse, which, with its dead eyes, ever seems 
to
be glaring upon him such a world of reproach.

     "That it is which should make people pause ere they dipped their hands 
in
the blood of others, and that it is which becomes the first retribution that
the murderer has to endure for the deep crime that he has committed.

     "We tore two stakes from a hedge, and with their assistance we 
contrived
to dig a very superficial hole, such a hole as was only sufficient, by 
placing
a thin coating of earth over it, to conceal the body of the murdered man.

     "And then came the loathsome task of dragging him into it-- a task full
of horror, and from which we shrunk aghast; but it had to be done, and,
therefore, we stooped, and grasping the clothes as best we might, we dragged
the body into the chasm we had prepared for its reception.  Glad were we 
then
to be enabled to throw earth upon it and to stamp upon it with such 
vehemence
as might well be supposed to actuate men deeply anxious to put out of sight
some dangerous and loathsome object.

     "When we had completed this, and likewise gathered handsfull of dust 
from
the road, and dry leaves, and such other matter, to sprinkle upon the grave,
so as to give the earth an appearance of not having been disturbed, we 
looked
at each other and breathed from our toil.

     "Then, and not till then, was it that we remembered that among other
things which the gambler had won of Marmaduke were the deeds belonging to 
the
Dearbrook property."

     "The Dearbrook property!" exclaimed Henry Bannerworth; "I know that 
there
was a small estate going by that name, which belonged to our family, but I
always understood that long ago my father had parted with it."

     "Yes; it was mortgaged for a small sum-- a sum not a fourth part of its
value-- and it had been redeemed by Marmaduke Bannerworth, not for the 
purpose
of keeping it, but in order that he might sell it outright, and so partially
remedy his exhausted finances."

     "I was not aware of that," returned Henry.

     "Doubtless you were not, for of late-- I mean for the twelve months or 
so
preceding your father's death-- you know he was must estranged from all the
family, so that you none of you knew much of what he was doing, except that 
he
was carrying on a very wild and reckless career, such as was sure to end in
dishonour and poverty; but I tell you he had the title deeds of the 
Dearbrook
property, and that they were only got from him, along with everything else 
of
value that he possessed, at the gaming table, by the man who paid such a
fearful penalty for his success.

     "It was not until after the body was completely buried, and we had
completed all our precautions for more effectually hiding it from 
observation,
that we recollected the fact of those important papers being in his
possession.  It was Marmaduke Bannerworth who first remembered it, and he
exclaimed, --

     "'By Heaven, we have buried the title deeds of the property, and we 
shall
have again to exhume the corpse for the purpose of procuring them.'

     "Now those deeds were nothing to me, and repugnant as I had felt from 
the
first to having anything whatever to do with the dead body, it was not 
likely
that I would again drag it from the earth for such an object.

     "'Marmaduke Bannerworth,' I said, 'you can do what you please, and take
the consequences of what you do, but I will not again, if I can help it, 
look
upon the face of that corpse.  It is too fearful a sight to contemplate 
again.
 You have a large sum of money, and what need you care now for the title 
deeds
of a property comparatively insignificant?'

     "'Well, well,' he said, 'I will not, at the present time, disturb the
remains; I will wait to see if anything should arise from the fact of the
murder; if it should turn out that no suspicion of any kind is excited, but
that all is still and quiet, I can then take measures to exhume the corpse,
and recover those papers, which certainly are important.'

     "By this time the morning was creeping on apace, and we thought it
prudent to leave the spot.  We stood at the end of the lane for a few 
moments
conversing, and those moments were the last in which I ever saw Marmaduke
Bannerworth."

     "Answer me a question," said Henry.

     "I will; ask me what you please, I will answer it."

     "Was it you that called at Bannerworth Hall, after my father's 
melancholy
death, and inquired for him?"

     "I did; and when I heard of the deed that he had done, I at once left, 
in
order to hold counsel with myself as to what I should do to obtain at least 
a
portion of the property, one-half of which, it was understood, was to have
been mine.  I heard what had been the last words used by Marmaduke 
Bannerworth
on the occasion of his death, and they were amply sufficient to let me know
what had been done with the money-- at all events, so far as regards the
bestowal of it in some secret place; and from that moment the idea of, by 
some
means or another, getting the exclusive possession of it, never forsook my
mind.

     "I thought over the matter by day and by night; and with the exception 
of
having a knowledge of the actual hiding-place of the money, I could see, in
the clearest possible manner, how the whole affair had been transacted.  
There
can be no doubt but that Marmaduke Bannerworth had reached home safely with
the large sum of which he had become possessed, and that he had hidden it
securely, which was but an ordinary measure of precaution, when we come to
consider how the property had been obtained.

     "Then I suspect that, being alone, and left to the gloom of his own
miserable thoughts, they reverted so painfully to the past that he was
compelled to drink deeply for the purpose of drowning reflection.

     "The natural consequence of this, in his state, was, that partial
insanity supervened, and at a moment when frenzy rose far above reflection, 
he
must have committed the dreadful act which hurried him instantaneously to
eternity."

     "Yes," said Henry; "it must have been so; you have guessed truly.  He 
did
on that occasion drink an immense quantity of wine; but instead of stilling
the pangs of remorse it must have increased them, and placed him in such a
frenzied condition of intellect, that he found it impossible to withstand 
the
impulse of it, unless by the terrific act which ended his existence."

     "Yes, and which at once crushed all my expectations of the large 
fortune
which was to have been mine; for even the one-half of the sum which had been
taken from the gamester's pocket would have been sufficient to have enabled 
me
to live for the future in affluence.

     "I became perfectly maddened at the idea that so large a sum had passed
out of my hands.  I constantly hovered about Bannerworth Hall, hoping and
expecting that something might arise which would enable me to get admittance
to it, and make an active search through its recesses for the hidden 
treasure.

     "All my exertions were in vain.  I could hit upon no scheme whatever; 
and
at length, wearied and exhausted, I was compelled to proceed to London for 
the
sake of a subsistence.  It is only in that great metropolis that such 
persons
as myself, destitute of real resources, but infinitely reckless as regards 
the
means by which they acquire a subsistence, can hope to do so.  Once again,
therefore, I plunged into the vortex of London life, and proceeded, heedless
of the criminality of what I was about, to cater for myself by robbery, or,
indeed, in any manner which presented a prospect of success.  It was during
this career of mine, that I became associated with some of the most 
desperate
characters of the time; and the offences we committed were of that dariing
[sic] character that it could not be wondered at eventually so formidable a
gang of desperadoes must be by force broken up.

     "It so occurred, but unknown to us, that the police resolved upon 
making
one of the most vigorous efforts to put an end to the affair, and in
consequence a watch was set upon every one of our movements.

     "The result of this was, as might have been expected, our complete
dispersion, and the arrest of some our members, and among them myself.

     "I knew my fate almost from the first.  Our depredations had created 
such
a sensation, that the legislature, even, had made it a matter of importance
that we should be suppressed, and it was an understood thing among the 
judges,
that the severest penalties of the law should be inflicted upon any one of 
the
gang who might be apprehended and convicted.

     "My trial scarcely occupied an hour, and then I was convicted and
sentenced to execution, with an intimation from the judge that it would be
perfectly absurd of me to dream, for one moment, of a remission of that
sentence.

     "In this state of affairs, and seeing nothing but death before me, I 
gave
myself up to despair, and narrowly missed cheating the hangman of his 
victim.

     "More dead than alive, I was, however, dragged out to be judicially
murdered, and I shall never forget the crowd of frightful sensations that 
came
across my mind upon that terrific occasion.

     "It seemed as if my fate had then reached its climax, and I have really
but a dim recollection of the terrible scene.

     "I remember something of the confused murmur arising from an immense
throng of persons.  I remember looking about me, and seeing nothing but what
appeared to me an immense sea of human heads, and then suddenly I heard a 
loud
roar of execration burst from the multitude.

     "I shrunk back terrified, and it did, indeed, seem to me a brutal thing
thus to roar and shout at a man who was brought out to die.  I soon, 
however,
found that the mob who came to see such a spectacle was not so debased as I
imagined, but that it was at the hangman, who had suddenly made his 
appearance
on the scaffold, at whom they raised that fearful yell.

     "Some one-- I think it was one of the sheriffs-- must have noticed that 
I
was labouring under the impresssion that the cry from the mob was levelled 
at
me, for he spoke, saying, --

     "'It is at the hangman they shout,' and he indicated with his finger 
that
public functionary.  In my mind's eye I think I see him now, and I am 
certain
that I shall never forget the expression of his face.  It was perfectly
fearful; and afterwards, when I learned who and what he was, I was not
surprised that he should feel so acutely the painfully degrading office 
which
he had to perform.

     "The fatal rope was in a few minutes adjusted to my neck.  I felt its
pressure, and I heard the confused sounds of the monotonous voice of the
clergyman, as he muttered some prayers, that I must confess sounded to me at
the time like a mockery of human suffering.

     "Then suddenly there was a loud shout-- I felt the platform give way
beneath my feet-- I tried to utter a yell of agony, but could not-- it 
seemed
to me as if I was encompassed by fire, and then sensation left me, and I 
knew
no more.

                      *         *         *         *

     "The next feelings of existence that came over me consisted in a
frightful tingling sensation throughout my veins, and I felt myself making
vain efforts to scream.  All the sensations of a person suffering from a
severe attack of night-mare came across me, and I was in such an agony, that 
I
inwardly prayed for death to release me from such a cruel state of 
suffering. 
Then suddenly the power to utter a sound came to me, and I made use of it
well, for the piercing shriek I uttered, must have struck terror into the
hearts of all who heard it, since it appalled even myself.

     "Then I suppose I must have fainted, but when I recovered consciousness
again, I found myself upon a couch, and a man presenting some stimulus to me
in a cup.  I could not distinguish objects distinctly, but I heard him say,
'Drink, and you will be better.'

     "I did drink, for a raging thirst consumed me, and then I fell into a
sound sleep, which, I was afterwards told, lasted nearly twenty-four hours,
and when I recovered from that, I heard again the same voice that had before
spoken to me, asking me how I was.

     "I turned in the direction of the sound, and, as my vision was now
clearer, I could see that it was the hangman, whose face had made upon the
scaffold such an impression upon me-- an impression which I then considered 
my
last in this world, but which turned out not to be such by many a mingled 
one
of pain and pleasure since.

     "It was some time before I could speak, and when I did, it was only in 
a
few muttered words, to ask what had happened, and where I was.

     "'Do you not remember,' he said, 'that you were hanged?'

     "'I do-- I do,' was my reply.  Is this the region of damned souls?"

     "'No; you are still in this world, however strange you may think it. 
Listen to me, and I will briefly tell you how it is that you have come back 
again, as it were, from the very grave, to live and walk about among the
living.'

     "I listened to him with a strange and rapt attention, and then he told
how a young and enthusiastic medical man had been anxious to try some
experiments with regard to the restoration of persons apparently dead, and 
he
proceeded to relate how it was that he had given ear to the solicitations of
the man, and had consented to bring my body after it was hung for him to
experiment upon.  He related how the doctor had been successful, but how he
was so terrified at his own success, that he hastily fled, and had left
London, no one knowing whither he had gone.

     "I listened to this with the most profound attention, and then he
concluded, by saying to me, --

     "'There can be no doubt but my duty requires of me to give you up again
to the offended laws of your country.  I will not, however, do that, if you
will consent to an arrangement that I shall propose to you.'

     "I asked him what the arrangement was, and he said that if I would
solemnly bind myself to pay to him a certain sum per annum, he would keep my
secret, and forsaking his calling as hangman, endeavour to do something that
should bring with it pleasanter results.  I did so solemnly promise him, and 
I
have kept my word.  By one means or another I have succeeded in procuring 
the
required amount, and now he is no more."

     "I believe," cried Henry, "that he has fallen a victim to the blind 
fury
of the populace."

     "You are right, he has so, and accordingly I am relieved from the 
burden
of those payments; but it matters little, for now I am so near the tomb
myself, that, together with all my obligations, I shall soon be beyond the
reach of mortal cavilling."

     "You need not think so, Varney; you must remember that you are at 
present
suffering from circumstances, the pressure of which will soon pass away, and
then you will resume your wonted habits."

     "What did you do next?" said the admiral.  "Let's know all while you 
are
about it."

     "I remained at the hangman's house for some time, until all fear of
discovery was over, and then he removed me to a place of greater security,
providing me from his own resources with the means of existence, until I had
fully recovered my health, and then he told me to shift for myself.

     "During my confinement though, I had not been idle mentally, for I
concocted a plan, by which I should be enabled not only to live well myself,
but to pay to the hangman, whose name was Mortimore, the annual sum I had
agreed upon.  I need not go into the details of this plan.  Of course it was
neither an honest nor respectable one, but it succeeded, and I soon found
myself in a position to enable me thereby to keep my engagement, as well as 
to
supply me with means of plotting and planning for my future fortunes.

     "I had never for a moment forgotten that so large a sum of money was
somewhere concealed about Bannerworth Hall, and I still looked forward to
obtaining it by some means or another.

     "It was in this juncture of affairs, that one night I was riding on
horseback through a desolate part of England.  The moon was shining sweetly,
as I came to a broad stream of water, across which, about a mile further on, 
I
saw that there was a bridge, but being unwilling to waste time by riding up 
to
it, and fancying, by the lazy ripple of the waters, that the river was not
shallow, I plunged my horse boldly into the stream.

     "When we reached its centre, some sudden indisposition must have seized
the horse, for instead of swimming on well and gallantly as it had done
before, it paused for a moment, and then plunged headlong into the torrent.

     "I could not swim, and so, for a second time, death, with all its
terrors, appeared to be taking possession of me.  The waters rolled over my
head, gurgling and hissing in my ears, and then all was past.  I know no 
more,
until I found myself lying upon a bright green meadow, and the full beams of
the moon shining upon me.

     "I was giddy and sick, but I rose, and walked slowly away, each moment
gathering fresh strength, and from that time to this, I never discovered how 
I
came to be rescued from the water, and lying upon that green bank.  It has
ever been a mystery to me, and I expect it ever will.

     "Then from that moment the idea that I had a sort of charmed life came
across me, and I walked about with an impression that such was the case, 
until
I came across a man who said that he was a Hungarian, and who was full of
strange stories of vamypres.  Among other things, he told me that a vampyre
could not be drowned, for that the waters would cast him upon its banks, 
and,
if the moonbeams fell upon him, he would be restored to life.

     "This was precisely my story, and from that moment I believed myself to
be one of those horrible, but charmed beings, doomed to such a protracted
existence.  The notion grew upon me day by day, and hour by hour, until it
became quite a fixed and strong belief, and I was deceiving no one when I
played the horrible part that has been attributed to me."

     "But you don't mean to say that you believe you are a vampyre now?" 
said
the admiral.

     "I say nothing, and know not what to think.  I am a desperate man, and
what there is at all human in me, strange to say, all of you whom I sought 
to
injure, have awakened."

     "Heed not that," said Henry, "but continue your narrative.  We have
forgiven everything, and that ought to suffice to quiet your mind upon such 
a
subject."

     "I will continue; and, believe me, I will conceal nothing from you.  I
look upon the words I am now utttering as full, candid, and free confession;
and, therefore, it shall be complete."

     "The idea struck me that if, by taking advantage of my supposed
preternatural gifts, I could drive you from Bannerworth Hall, I should have 
it
to myself to hunt through at my leisure, and possibly find the treasure.  I
had heard from Marmaduke Bannerworth some slight allusion to concealing the
money behind a picture that was in a bed-room called the panelled chamber.  
By
inquiry, I ascertained that in that bed-room slept Flora Bannerworth.

     "I had resolved, however, at first to try pacific measures, and
accordingly, as you are well aware, I made various proposals to you to
purchase or to rent Bannerworth Hall, the whole of which you rejected; so 
that
I found myself compelled to adopt the original means that had suggested
themselves to me, and endeavour to terrify you from the house.

     "By prowling about, I made myself familiar with the grounds, and with 
all
the plan of the residence, and then one night made my appearance in Flora's
chamber by the window."

     "But how do you account," said Charles Holland, "for your extraordinary
likeness to the portrait?"

     "It is partly natural, for I belong to a collateral branch of the 
family;
and it was previously arranged.  I had seen the portrait in Marmaduke
Bannerworth's time, and I knew some of its peculiarities and dress
sufficiently well to imitate them.  I calculated upon producing a much 
greater
effect by such an imitation; and it appears that I was not wrong, for I did
produce it to the full."

     "You did, indeed," said Henry; "and if you did not bring conviction to
our minds that you were what you represented yourself to be, you at least
staggered our judgments upon the occasion, and left us in a position of 
great
doubt and difficulty."

     "I did; I did all that, I know I did; and, by pursuing that line of
conduct, I, at last, I presume, entirely forced you from the house."

     "That you did."

     "Flora fainted when I entered her chamber; and the moment I looked upon
her sweet countenance my heart smote me for what I was about; but I solemnly
aver, that my lips never touched her, and that, beyond the fright, she
suffered nothing from Varney, the vampyre."

     "And you have succeeded," said Henry, "in your object now?"

     "No; the treasure has yet to be found.  Mortimore, the hangman, 
followed
me into the house, guessing my intention, and indulging a hope that he would
succeed in sharing with me its proceeds.  But he, as well as myself, was
foiled, and nothing came of the toilsome and anxious search but 
disappointment
and bitterness."

     "Then it is supposed that the money is still concealed?"

     "I hope so; I hope, as well, that it will be discovered by you and 
yours;
for surely none can have a better right to it than you, who have suffered so
much on its account."

     "And yet," remarked Henry, "I cannot help thinking it is too securely
hidden from us.  The picture has been repeatedly removed from its place, and
produced no results; so that I fear we have little to expect from any 
further
or more protracted research."

     "I think," said Varney, "that you have everything to expect.  The words
of the dying Marmaduke Bannerworth, you may depend, were not spoken in vain;
and I have every reason to believe that, sooner or later, you must, without
question, become the possessors of that sum."

     "But ought we rightly to hold it?"

     "Who ought more rightly to hold it?" said Varney; "answer me that."

     "That's a sensible enough idea of your's," said the admiral; "and if 
you
were twice over a vampyre, I would tell you so.  It's a very sensible idea; 
I
should like to know who has more right to it than those who have had such a
world of trouble about it."

     "Well, well," said Henry, "we must not dispute, as yet, about a sum of
money that may really never come to hand.  For my own part, I have little to
hope for in the matter; but, certainly, nothing shall be spared, on my part,
to effect such a thorough search of the Hall as shall certainly bring it to
light, if it be in existence."

     "I presume, Sir Francis Varney," said Charles Holland, "that you have 
now
completed your narrative?"

     "I have.  After events are well known to you.  And, now, I have but to
lie down and die, with the hope of finding that rest and consolation in the
tomb which has been denied me hitherto in this world.  My life has been a
stormy one, and full of the results of angry passions.  I do hope now, that,
for the short time I have to live, I shall know something like serenity, and
die in peace."

     "You may depend, Varney, that, as long as you have an asylum with us,"
said the admiral -- "and that you may have as long as you like, -- you may 
be
at peace.  I consider that you have surrendered at discretion, and, under 
such
circumstances, an enemy always deserves honourable treatment, and always 
gets
it on board such a ship as this."
     
     "There you go again," said Jack, "calling the house a ship."

     "What's that to you, if I were to call it a bowsprit?  Ain't I your
captain, you lubber, and so, sure to be right, while you are wrong, in the
natural order of things?  But you go and lay down, Master Varney, and rest
yourself, for you seem completely done up."

     Varney did look fearfully exhausted; and, with the assistance of Henry
and Charles, he went into another apartment, and laid down upon a couch,
showing great symptoms of debility and want of power.

     And now it was a calm; Varney's stay at the cottage of the Bannerworths
was productive of a different mood of mind than ever he had possessed 
before. 
He looked upon them in a very different manner to what he had been used to. 
He had, moreover, considerably altered prospects; there could not be the 
same
hopes and expectations that he once had.  He was an altered man.  He saw in
the Bannerworths those who had saved his life, and who, without doubt, had
possessed an opinion, not merely obnoxious to him, but must have had some
fearful misgivings concerning his character, and that, too, of a nature that
usually shuts out all hope of being received into any family.

     But, in the hour of his need, when his life was in danger, no one else
would have done what they had done for him, especially when so relatively
placed.

     Moreover, he had been concealed, when to do so was both dangerous and
difficult; and then it was done by Flora Bannerworth herself.

     Time flew by.  The mode of passing time at the cottage was calm and
serene.  Varney had seldom witnessed anything like it; but, at the same 
time,
he felt more at ease than ever he had; he was charmed with the society of
Flora -- in fact, with the whole of the little knot of individuals who there
collected together; from what he saw he was gratified in their society; and 
it
seemed to alleviate his mental disquiet, and the sense he must feel of his 
own
peculiar position.

     But Varney became ill.  The state of mind and body he had been in for
some time past might be the cause of it.  He had been much harassed, and
hunted from place to place.  There was not a moment in which his life was 
not
in danger, and he had, moreover, in more than one case, received some bodily
injuries, bruises, and contusions of a desperate character; and yet he would
take no notice of them, but allow them to get well again, as best they 
could.

     His escapes and injuries had made a deep impression upon his mind, and
had no doubt a corresponding effect upon his body, and Varney became very 
ill.

     Flora Bannerworth did all that could be done for one in his painful
position, and this greatly added to the depth of thought that occasionally
beset him, and he could scarcely draw one limb after the other.

     He walked from room to room in the twilight, at which time he had more
liberty permitted him than at any other, because there was not the same 
danger
in his doing so; for, if once seen, there could be no matter of doubt but he
would have been pursued until he was destroyed, when no other means of 
escape
were at hand; and Varney himself felt that there could be no chance of his
again escaping from them, for his physical powers were fast decaying; he was
not, in fact, the same man.

     He came out into the parlour from the room in which he had been seated
during the day.  Flora and her mother were there, while Charles Holland and
Henry Bannerworth had both at that moment entered the apartment.

     "Good evening, Miss Bannerworth," said Sir Francis, bowing to her, and
then to her mother, Mrs. Bannerworth; "and you, Mr. Holland, I see, have 
been
out enjoying the free breeze that plays over the hot fields.  It must be
refreshing."

     "It is so, sir," said Charles.  "I wish we could make you a partaker in
our walks."

     "I wish you could with all my heart," said Varney.

     "Sir Francis," said Flora, "must be a prisoner for some short time 
longer
yet."

     "I ought not to consider it in any such light.  It is not imprisonment. 
I have taken sanctuary.  It is the well spring of life to me," said Varney.

     "I hope it may prove so; but how do you find yourself this evening, Sir
Francis Varney?"

     "Really, it is difficult to say-- I fluctuate.  At times, I feel as
though I should drop insensible on the earth, and then I feel better than I
have done for some time previously."

     "Doctor Chillingworth will be here by-and-bye, no doubt; and he must 
see
what he can do for you to relieve you of these symptoms.' said Flora.

     "I am much beholden to you-- much beholden to you; but I hope to be 
able
to do without the good doctor's aid in this instance, though I must admit I
may appear ungrateful."

     "Not at all-- not at all."

     "Have you heard any news abroad today?" inquired Varney.

     "None, Sir Francis-- none; there is nothing apparently stirring; and 
now,
go out when you would, you would find nothing but what was old, quiet, and
familiar."

     "We cannot wish to look upon anything with more charms for a mind at
ease, than we can see under such circumstances; but I fear there are some 
few
old and familiar features that I should find sad havoc in."

     "You would, certainly, for the burnings and razings to the ground of 
some
places, have made some dismal appearances; but time may efface that, and 
then
the evil may die away, and the future will become the present, should we be
able to allay popular feeling."

     "Yes," said Sir Francis; "but popular prejudices, or justice, or 
feeling,
are things not easily assuaged.  The people when once aroused go on to 
commit
all kinds of excess, and there is no one point at which they will stop short
of the complete extirpation of some one object or other that they have taken 
a
fancy to hunt.'

     "The hubbub and excitement must subside."

     "The greater the ignorance the more persevering and the more brutal 
they
are," said Sir Francis; "but I must not complain of what is the necessary
consequence of their state."

     "It might be otherwise."

     "So it might, and no mischief arise either; but as we cannot divert the
stream, we may as well bend to the force of a current too strong to resist."

     "The moon is up," said Flora, who wished to turn the conversation from
that to another topic.  "I see it yonder through the trees; it rises red and
large-- it is very beautiful-- and yet there is not a cloud about to give it
the colour and appearance it now wears."

     "Exactly so," said Sir Francis Varney; "but the reason is the air is
filled with a light, invisible vapour, that has the effect you perceive. 
There has been much evaporation going on, and now it shows itself in giving
the moon that peculiar large appearance and deep colour."

     "Ay, I see; it peeps through the trees, the branches of which cut it up
into various portions.  It is singular, and yet beautiful, and yet the earth
below seems dark."

     "It is dark; you would be surprised to find it so if you walked about. 
It will soon be lighter than it is at this present moment."

     "What sounds are those?" inquired Sir Francis Varney, as he listened
attentively.

     "Sounds!  What sounds?" returned Henry.

     "The sounds of wheels and horses' feet," said Varney.

     "I cannot even hear them, much less can I tell what they are," said
Henry.

     "Then listen.  Now they come along the road.  Cannot you hear them 
now?"
said Varney.

     "Yes, I can," said Charles Holland; "but I really don't know what they
are, or what it can matter to us; we don't expect any visitors."

     "Certainly, certainly, said Varney.  "I am somewhat apprehensive of the
approach of strange sounds."

     "You are not likely to be disturbed here," said Charles.

     "Indeed; I thought so when I had succeeded in getting into the house
near the town, and so far from believing it was likely I should be 
discovered,
that I sat on the house-top while the mob surrounded it."

     "Did you not hear them coming?"

     "I did."

     "And yet you did not attempt to escape from them?"

     "No, I could not persuade them I was not there save by my utter 
silence. 
I allowed them to come too close to leave myself time to escape-- besides, I
could hardly persuade myself there could be any necessity for so doing."

     "It was fortunate it was as it happened afterwards, that you were able 
to
reach the wood, and get out of it unperceived by the mob."

     "I should have been in an unfortunate condition had I been in their 
hands
long.  A man made of iron would be able to resist the brutality of those
people."

     As they were speaking, a gig, with two men, drove up, followed by one 
on
horseback.  They stopped at the garden-gate, and then tarried to consult 
with
each other, as they looked at the house.

     "What can they want, I wonder?" inquired Henry; "I never saw them
before."

     "Nor I," said Charles Holland.

     "Do you not know them at all?" inquired Varney.

     "No," replied Flora; "I never saw them, neither can I imagine what is
their object in coming here."

     "Did you ever see them before?" inquired Henry of his mother, who held 
up
her hand to look more carefully at the strangers; then, shaking her head, 
she
declared she had never seen such persons as those.

     "I dare say not," said Charles Holland.  "They certainly are not
gentlemen; but here they come; there is some mistake, I daresay-- they don't
want to come here."

     As they spoke, the two strangers got down; after picking up a top coat
they had let fall, they turned round, and deliberately put it into the 
chaise
again; they walked up the path to the door, at which they knocked.

     The door was opened by the old woman, when the two men entered.

     "Does Francis Beauchamp live here?"

     "Eh?" said the old woman, who was a little deaf, and she put her hand
behind her ear to catch the sounds more distinctly -- "eh? -- who did you
say?"

     Sir Francis Varney started as the sounds came upon his ear, but he sat
still an attentive listener.

     "Are there any strangers in the house?" inquired the other officer,
impatiently.  "Who is here?"

     "Strangers!" said the old woman; "you are the only strangers that I 
have
seen here."

     "Come," said the officer to his companion, "come this way; there are
people in this parlour.  Our business must be an apology for any rudeness we
may commit."

     As he spoke he stepped by the old woman, and laying his hand upon the
handle of the door, entered the apartment, at the same time looking 
carefully
around the room as if he expected some one.

     "Ladies," said the stranger, with an offhand politeness that had
something repulsive in it, though it was meant to convey a notion that
civility was intended; "ladies, I beg pardon for intruding, but I am looking
for a gentleman."

     "You shall hear from me again soon," said Sir Francis, in an almost
imperceptible whisper.

     "What is the object of this intrusion?" demanded Henry Bannerworth,
rising and confronting the stranger.  "This is a strange introduction."

     "Yes, but not an unusual one," said the stranger, "in these cases--
being unavoidable, at the least."

     "Sir," said Charles Holland, "if you cannot explain quickly your
business here, we will proceed to take those measures which will, at least
rid ourselves of your company."

     "Softly, sir.  I mean no offence-- not the least; but I tell you I do 
not
come for any purpose that is at all consonant to my wishes.  I am a Bow-
street
officer in the execution of my duty-- excuse me, therefore."

     "Whom do you want?"

     "Francis Beauchamp; and, from the peculiarity of the appearance of this
individual here, I think I may safely request the pleasure of his company."

     Varney now rose, and the officer made a rush at him, when he saw him do
so, saying, --

     "Surrender in the king's name."

     Varney, however, paid no attention to that, but rushed past, throwing 
his
chair down to impede the officer, who could not stay himself, but fell over
it, while Varney made a rush towards the window, which he cleared at one
bound, and crossing the road, was lost to sight in a few seconds in the 
trees
and hedges on the other side.

     "Accidents will happen," said the officer, as he rose to his feet; "I 
did
not think the fellow would have taken the window in that manner; but we have
him in view, and that will be enough."

     "In heaven's name," said Henry, "explain all about this; we cannot
understand one word of it-- I am at a loss to understand one word of it."

     "We will return and do so presently," said the officer as he dashed out
of the house after the fugitive at a rapid and reckless speed, followed by 
his
companion.

     The man who had been left with the chaise, however, was the first in 
the
chase; seeing an escape from the window, he immediately guessed that he was
the man wanted, and, but for an accident, he would have met Varney at the
gate, for, as he was getting out in a hurry, his foot became entangled with
the reins, and he fell to the ground, and Varney at the same moment stepped
over him.

     "Curse his infernal impudence, and d--n these reins!" muttered the man 
in
a fury at the accident, and the aggravating circumstance of the fugitive
walking over him in such a manner, and so coolly too -- it was vexing.

     The man, however, quickly released himself, and rushed after Varney
across the road, and kept on his track for some time.  The moon was still
rising, and shed but a gloomy light around.  Everything was almost invisible
until you came close to it.  This was the reason why Varney and his pursuer
met with several severe accidents -- tumbles and hard knocks against
impediments which the light and the rapid flight they were taking did not
admit of their avoiding very well.

     They went on for some time, but it was evident that Varney knew the 
place
best, and could avoid what the man could not, and that was the trees and the
natural impediments of the ground, which Varney was acquainted with.

     For instance, at full speed across a meadow, a hollow would suddenly
present itself, and to an accustomed eye the moonlight might enable it to be
distinguished at a glance what it was, while to one wholly unaccustomed to 
it,
the hollow would often look like a hillock by such a light.  This Varney 
would
clear at a bound, which a less agile and heavier person would step into,
lifting up his leg to meet an impediment, when he would find it come down
suddenly some six or eight inches lower than he anticipated, almost
dislocating his leg and neck, and producing a corresponding loss of breath,
which was not regained by the muttered curse upon such a country where the
places were so uneven.

     Having come to one of these places, which was little more perceptible
than the others, he made a desperate jump, but he jumped into the middle of
the hole with such force that he sprained his ankle, besides sinking into a
small pond that was almost dry, being overgrown with rushes and aquatic
plants.

     "Well?" said the other officer coming up -- "well?"

     "Well, indeed!" said the one who came first; "it's anything but well. 
D--n all country excursions say I."

     "Why, Bob, you don't mean to say as how you are caught in a rat-trap?"

     "Oh, you be d---d!  I am, ain't I?"

     "Yes; but are you going to stop there, or coming out, eh?  You'll catch
cold."

     "I have sprained my ankle."

     "Well?"

     "It ain't well, I tell you; here have I a sprained foot, and my wind
broken for a month at least.  Why were you not quicker?  If you had been
sharper we should have had the gentleman, I'll swear!"

     "I tumbled down over the chair, and he got out of the window, and I 
come
out of the door."

     "Well, I got entangled in the reins; but I got off after him, only his
long legs carried him over everything.  I tell you what, Wilkinson, if I 
were
to be born again, and intended to be a runner, I would bespeak a pair of 
long
legs."

     "Why?"

     "Because I should be able to get along better.  You have no idea of how
he skimmed along the ground; it was quite beautiful, only it wasn't good to
follow it."

     "A regular sky scraper!"

     "Yes, or something of that sort; he looked like a patent flying 
shadow."

     "Well, get up and lead the way; we'll follow you."

     "I dare say you will-- when I lead the way back there; for as to going
out yonder, it is quite out of the question.  I want supper to-night and
breakfast to-morrow morning."

     "Well, what has that to do with it?"

     "Just this much: if you follow any farther, you'll get into the woods,
and there you'll be, going round and round, like a squirrel in a cage, 
without
being able to get out, and you will there get none of the good things 
included
under the head of those meals."

     "I think so too," said the third,

     "Well, then, let's go back; we needn't run, though it might be as well 
to
do so."

     "It would be anything but well.  I don't gallop back, depend upon it."

     The three men now slowly returned from their useless chase, and re-trod
the way they had passed once in such a hurry that they could hardly 
recognize
it.

     "What a dreadful bump I came against that pole standing there," said
one.

     "Yes, and I came against a hedge-stake, that was placed so as the moon
didn't show any light on it.  It came into the pit of my stomach.  I never
recollect such a pain in my life; for all the world like a hot coal being
suddenly and forcibly intruded into your stomach."

     "Well, here's the road.  I must go up to the house where I started 
from. 
I promised them some explanation.  I may as well go and give it to them a
once."

     "Do as you will.  I will wait with the horse, else, perhaps, that
Beauchamp will again return and steal him."

     The officer who had first entered the house now returned to the
Bannerworths, saying,

     "I promised you I would give you some explanation as to what you have
witnessed."

     "Yes," said Henry; "we have been awaiting your return with some anxiety
and curiosity.  What is the meaning of all this?  I am, as we are all, in
perfect ignorance of the meaning of what took place."

     "I will tell you.  The person whom you have had here, and goes by the
name of Varney, is named Francis Beauchamp."

     "Indeed!  Are you assured of this?"

     "Yes, perfectly assured of it; I have it in my warrant to apprehend him
by either name."

     "What crime had he been guilty of?"

     "I will tell you: he has been _hanged_."

     "Hanged!" exclaimed all present.

     "What do you mean by that?" added Henry; "I am at a loss to understand
what you can mean by saying he was hanged."

     "What I say is literally true."

     "Pray tell us all about it.  We are much interested in the fact; go on,
sir."

     "Well, sir, then I believe it was for murder that Francis Beauchamp was
hanged-- yes, hanged; a common execution, before a multitude of people,
collected to witness such an exhibition."

     "Good God!" exclaimed Henry Bannerworth.  "And was-- but that is
impossible.  A dead man come to life again!  You must be amusing yourself at
our expense."

     "Not I," replied the officer.  "Here is my warrant; they don't make 
these
out in a joke."

     And, as he spoke, he produced the warrant, when it was evident the
officer spoke the truth.

     "How was this?"

     "I will tell you, sir.  You see that this Varney was a regular scamp,
gamester, rogue, and murderer.  He was hanged, and hung about the usual 
time;
he was cut down and the body was given to some one for dissection, when a
surgeon, with the hangman, one Montgomery, succeeded in restoring the 
criminal
to life."

     "But I always thought they broke the neck when they were hanged; the
weight of the body would alone do that."

     "Oh, dear, no, sir," said the officer; "that is one of the common every
day mistakes; they don't break the neck once in twenty times."

     "Indeed!"

     "No; they die of suffocation only; this man, Beauchamp, was hanged 
thus,
but they contrived to restore him, and then he assumed a new name, and left
London."

     "But how came you to know all this?"

     "Oh! it came to us, as many things usually do, in a very extraordinary
manner, and in a manner that appears most singular and out of the way; but
such it was.

     "The executioner who was the means of his being restored, or one of 
them,
wished to turn him to account, and used to draw a yearly sum of money from
him, as hush money, to induce them to keep the secret; else, the fact of his
having escaped punishment would subject him to a repetition of the same
punishment; when, of course, a little more care would be taken that he did 
not
escape a second time."

     "I dare say not."

     "Well, you see, Varney, or rather Beauchamp, was to pay a heavy sum to
this man to keep him quiet, and to permit him to enjoy the life he had so
strangely become possessed of."

     "I see," said Holland.

     "Well, this man, Montgomery; had always some kind of suspicion that
Varney would murder him."

     "Murder him! and he the means of saving his life; surely he could not 
be
so bad as that."

     "Why, you see, sir, this hangman drew a heavy sum yearly from him; thus
making him only a mine of wealth to himself; this, no doubt, would rankle in
the other's heart, to think he should be so beset, and hold his life upon 
such
terms."

     "I see, now."

     "Yes; and then came the consideration that he did not do it from any 
good
motive, merely a selfish one, and he was consequently under no obligation to
him for what he had done; besides, self-preservation might urge him on, and
tell him to do the deed.

     "However that may be, Montgomery dreaded it, and was resolved to punish
the deed if he could not prevent it.  He, therefore, left general orders 
with
his wife, whenever he went on a journey to Varney, if he should be gone 
beyond
a certain time, she was to open a certain drawer, and take out a sealed 
packet
to the magistrate at the chief office, who would attend to it.

     "He has been missing, and his wife did as she was desired and now we 
have
found what he there mentioned to be true; but, now, sir, I have satisfied 
you
and explained to you why we intruded upon you, we must now leave and seek 
for
him elsewhere."

     "It is  most extraordinary, and that is the reason why his complexion 
is
so singular."

     "Very likely."

     They poured out some wine, which was handed to the officers, who drank
and then quitted the house, leaving the inmates in a state of stupefaction,
from surprise and amazement at what they had heard from the officers.

     There was a strange feeling came over them when they recollected the 
many
occurrences they had witnessed, and even the explanation of the officers; it
seemed as if some mist had enveloped objects and rendered them indistinct, 
but
which was fast rising, and they were becoming plainer and more distinct 
every
moment in which they were regarded.

     There was a long pause, and Flora was about to speak, when suddenly 
there
came the sound of a footstep across the garden.  It was slow but unsteady, 
and
paused between whiles until it came close beneath the windows.  They 
remained
silent, and then some one was heard to climb up the rails of the veranda, 
and
then the curtains were thrust aside, but not till after the person outside 
had
paused to ascertain who was there.

     Then the curtains were opened, and the visage of Sir Francis Varney
appeared, much altered; in fact, completely worn and exhausted.

     It was useless to deny it, but he looked ghastly -- terrific; his
singular visage was as pallid as death; his eyes almost protruding, his 
mouth
opened, and his breathing short, and laboured in the extreme.

     He climbed over with much difficulty, and staggered into the room, and
would have spoken, but he could not; he fell senseless upon the floor, 
utterly
exhausted and motionless.

     There was a long pause, and each one present looked at each other, and
then they gazed upon the inanimate body of Sir Francis Varney, which lay
supine and senseless in the middle of the floor.

                 *         *         *         *         *

     The importance of the document, said to be on the dead body, was such
that it would admit of no delay before it was obtained, and the party
determined that it should be commenced instanter.  Lost time would be an
object to them; too much haste could hardly be made; and now came the 
question
of, "should it be to-night, or not?"

     "Certainly," said Henry Bannerworth; "the sooner we can get it, the
sooner all doubt and distress will be at an end; and, considering the run of
events, that will be desirable for all our sakes; besides, we know not what
unlucky accident may happen to deprive us of what is so necessary."

     "There can be none," said Mr. Chillingworth; "but there is this to be
said, this has been such an eventful history, that I cannot say what might 
or
what might not happen."

     "We may as well go this very night," said Charles Holland.  "I give my
vote for an immediate exhumation of the body.  The night is somewhat stormy,
but nothing more; the moon is up, and there will be plenty of light."

     "And rain," said the doctor.

     "Little or none," said Charles Holland.  "A few gusts of wind now and
then drive a few heavy plashes of rain against the windows, and that gives a
fearful sound, which is, in fact, nothing, when you have to encounter it; 
but
you will go, doctor?"

     "Yes, most certainly.  We must have some tools."

     "Those may be had from the garden," said Henry.  "Tools for the
exhumation, you mean?"

     "Yes; pick-axe, mattocks, and a crowbar; a lantern, and so forth," said
the doctor.  "You see I am at home in this; the fact is, I have had more 
than
one affair of this kind on my hands before now, and whilst a student I have
had more than one adventure of a strange character."

     "I dare say, doctor," said Charles Holland, "you have some sad pranks 
to
answer for; you don't think of it then, only when you find them accumulated 
in
a heap, so that you shall not be able to escape from them; because they come
over your senses when you sleep at night."

     "No, no," said Chillingworth; "you are mistaken in that.  I have long
since settled all my accounts of that nature; besides, I never took a dead
body out of a grave but in the name of science, and never for my own profit,
seeing I never sold one in my life, or got anything by it."

     "That is not the fact," said Henry; "you know, doctor, you improved 
your
own talents and knowledge."

     "Yes, yes; I did."

     "Well, but you profited by such improvements?"

     "Well, granted, I did.  How much more did the public not benefit then,"
said the doctor, with a smile.

     "Ah, well, we won't argue the question," said Charles; "only it strikes
me that the doctor could never have been a doctor if he had not determined
upon following a profession."

     "There may be a little truth in that," said Chillingworth; "but now we
had better quit the house, and make the best of our way to the spot where 
the
unfortunate man lies buried in his unhallowed grave."

     "Come with me into the garden," said Henry Bannerworth; "we shall there
be able to suit ourselves to what is required.  I have a couple of 
lanterns."

     "One is enough," said Chillingworth; "we had better not burden 
ourselves
more than we are obliged to do; and we shall find enough to do with the
tools."

     "Yes, they are not light; and the distance is by far too great to make
walking agreeable and easy; the wind blows strong, and the rain appears to 
be
coming up afresh, and, by the time we have done, we shall find the ground 
will
become slippy, and bad for walking."

     "Can we have a conveyance?"

     "No, no," said the doctor; "we could, but we must trouble the turnpike
man; besides, there is a shorter way across some fields, which will be 
better
and safer."

     "Well, well," said Charles Holland; "I do not mind which way it is, as
long as you are satisfied yourselves.  The horse and cart would have settled
it all better, and done it quicker, besides carrying the tools."

     "Very true, very true," said the doctor; "all that is not without its
weight, and you shall choose which way you would have it done; for my part, 
I
am persuaded the expedition on foot is to be preferred for two reasons."

     "And what are they?"

     "The first is, we cannot obtain a horse and cart without giving some
detail as to what you want it for, which is awkward, on account of the hour. 
Moreover, you could not get one at this moment in time."

     "That ought to settle the argument," said Henry Bannerworth; "an
impossibility, under the circumstances, at once is a clincher, and one that
may be allowed to have some weight."

     "You may say that," said Charles.

     "Besides which, you must go a greater distance, and that, too, along 
the
main road, which is objectionable."

     "Then we are agreed," said Charles Holland, and the sooner we are off 
the
better; the night grows more and more gloomy every hour, and more 
inclement."

     "It will serve our purpose the better," said Chillinworth.  "What we 
do,
we may as well do now."

     "Come with me to the garden," said Henry, "and we will take the tools. 
We can go out the back way; that will preclude any observation being made."

     They all now left the apartment, wrapped up in great overcoats, to 
secure
themselves against the weather, and also for the purpose of concealing
themselves from any chance passenger.

     In the garden they found the tools they required, and having chosen 
them,
they took a lantern, with the means of getting a light when they got to 
their
journey's end, which they would do in less than an hour.

     After having duly inspected the state of their efficiency, they started
away on their expedition.

     The night had turned gloomy and windy; heavy driving masses of clouds
obscured the moon, which only now and then was to be seen, when the clouds
permitted her to peep out.  At the same time, there were many drifting
showers, which lasted but a few minutes, and then the clouds were carried
forwards by some sudden gust of wind so that, altogether, it was a most
uncomfortable night as well could be imagined.

     However, there was no time to lose, and, under all circumstances, they
could not have chosen a better night for their purpose than the one they 
had;
indeed, they could not desire another night to be out on such a purpose.

     They spoke not while they were within sight of the houses, though at 
the
distance of many yards, and, at the same time, there was a noise through the
trees that would have carried their voices past every object, however close;
but they would make assurance doubly sure.

     "I think we are fairly away now," said Henry, "from all fear of being
recognized."

     "To be sure you are.  Who would recognize us now, if we were met?"

     "No one."

     "I should think not; and, moreover, there would be but small chance of
any evil coming from it, even if it were to happen that we were to be seen 
and
known.  Nobody knows what we are going to do, and, if they did, there is no
illegality in the question."

     "Certainly not; but we wish the matter to be quite secret, therefore, 
we
don't wish to be seen by any one while upon this adventure."

     "Exactly," said Chillingworth; "and, if you'll follow my guidance, you
shall meet nobody."

     "We will trust you, most worthy doctor.  What have you to say for our
confidence?"

     "That you will find it is not misplaced."

     Just as the doctor had uttered the last sound, there came a hearty 
laugh
upon the air, which, indeed, sounded but a few paces in advance of them.  
The
wind blew towards them, and would, therefore, cause the sounds to come to
them, but not to go away in the direction they were going.

     The whole party came to a sudden stand still; there was something so
strange in hearing a laugh at that moment, especially as Chillingworth was, 
at
that moment, boasting of his knowledge of the ground and the certainty of
their meeting no one.

     "What is that?" inquired Henry.

     "Some one laughing, I think," said Chillingworth.

     "Of that there can be little or no doubt," said Charles Holland; "and, 
as
people do not usually laugh by themselves so heartily, it may be presumed
there are, at least, two."

     "No doubt of it."

     "And, moreover, their purpose cannot be a very good one, at this hour 
of
the night, and of such a night, too.  I think we had better be cautious."

     "Hush!  Follow me silently," said Henry.

     As he spoke, he moved cautiously from the spot where he stood, and, at
the same time, he was followed by the whole party, until they came to the
hedge which skirted a lane, in which were seated three men.

     They had a sort of tent erected, and that was hung upon a part of the
hedge which was to windward of them, so that it sheltered them from wind and
rain.

     Henry and Chillingworth both peeped over the bank, and saw them seated
beneath this kind of canopy.  They were shabby, gipsy-looking men, who might
be something else -- sheep-stealers, or horse-stealers, in fact, anything,
even to beggars.

     "I say, Jack," said one; "it's no bottle to-night."

     "No; there's nobody about these parts to-night.  We are safe, and so 
are
they."

     "Exactly."

     "Besides, you see, those who do happen to be out are not worth talking
to."

     "No cash."

     "None, not enough to pay turnpike for a walking-stick, at the most."

     "Besides, it does us no good to take a few shillings from a poor 
wretch,
who has more in family than he has shillings in pocket."

     "Ay, you are right, quite right.  I don't like it myself, I don't;
besides that, there's fresh risk in every man you stop, and these poor 
fellows
will fight hard for a few shillings, and there is no knowing what an unlucky
blow may do for a man."

     "That is very true.  Has anything been done to-night?"

     "Nothing," said one.

     "Only three half crowns," said the other; "that is the extent of the
common purse to-night."

     "And I," said the third, "I have got a bottle of bad gin from the Cat 
and
Cabbagestump."

     "How did you manage it?"

     "Why, this way.  I went in, and had some beer, and you know I can give 
a
long yarn when I want; but it wants only a little care to deceive these
knowing countrymen, so I talked and talked, until they got quite chatty, and
then I put the gin in my pocket."

     "Good."

     "Well, then, the loaf and beef I took out of the safe as I came by, and 
I
dare say they know they have lost it by this time."

     "Yes, and so do we.  I expect the gin will help to digest the beef, so 
we
mustn't complain of the goods."

     "No; give us another glass, Jim."

     Jim held the glass towards him, when the doctor, animated by the spirit
of mischief, took a good sized pebble, and threw it into the glass, smashing
it, and spilling the contents.

     In a moment there was a change of scene; the men were all terrified, 
and
started to their feet, while a sudden gust of wind caused their light to go
out; at the same time their tent-cloth was thrown down by the wind, and fell
across their heads.

     "Come along," said the doctor.

     There was no need of saying  so, for in a moment the three were as if
animated by one spirit, and away they scudded across the fields, with the
speed of a race-horse.

     In a few minutes they were better than half a mile away from the spot.

     "In absence of all authentic information," said the doctor, speaking as
well as he could, and blowing prodigiously between each word, as though he
were fetching breath all the way from his heels, "I think we may conclude we
are safe from them.  We ought to thank our stars we came across them in the
way we did."

     "But, doctor, what in the name of Heaven induced you to make such a
noise, to frighten them, in fact, and to tell them some one was about?"

     "They were too much terrified to tell whether it was one, or fifty.  By
this time they are out of the county; they knew what they were talking 
about."

     "And perhaps we may meet them on the road where we are going, thinking 
it
a rare lonely spot where they can hide, and no chance of their being found
out."

     "No," said the doctor; "they will not go to such a place; it has by far
too bad a name for even such men as those to go near, much less stop in."

     "I can hardly think that," said Charles Holland, "for these fellows are
too terrified for their personal safety, to think of the superstitious fears
with which a place may be regarded; and these men, in such a place as the 
one
you speak of, they will be at home."

     "Well, well, rather than be done, we must fight for it; and when you 
come
to consider we have one pick and two shovels, we shall be in full force."

     "Well said, doctor; how far have we to go?"

     "Not more than a quarter of a mile."

     They pursued their way through the fields, and under the hedgerows, 
until
they came to a gate, where they stopped awhile, and began to consult and to
listen.

     "A few yards up here, on the left," said the doctor; "I know the spot;
besides, there is a particular mark.  Now, then, are you all ready?"

     "Yes, all."

     "Here," said the doctor, pointing out the marks by which the spot might
be recognized; "here is the spot, and I think we shall not be half a foot 
out
of our reckoning."

     "Then let us begin instanter," said Henry, as he seized hold of the
pickaxe, and began to loosen the earth by means of the sharp end.

     "That will do for the present," said Chillingworth; "now let me and
Charles take a turn with our shovels, and you will get on again presently. 
Throw the earth up on the bank in one heap, so that we can put it on again
without attracting any attention to the spot by its being left in clods and
uneven."

     "Exactly," said Henry, "else the body will be discovered."

     They began to shovel away, and continued to do so, after it had been
picked up, working alternately, until at length Charles stuck his pick-axe
into something soft, and upon pulling it up, he found it was the body.

     A dreadful odour now arose from the spot, and they were at no loss to
tell where the body lay.  The pick-axe had stuck into the deceased's rib and
clothing, and thus lifted it out of its place.

     "Here it is," said the doctor; "but I needn't tell you that; the
charnel-house smell is enough to convince you of the fact of where it is."

     "I think so; just show a light upon the subject, doctor, and then we 
can
see what we are about-- do you mind, doctor-- you have the management of the
lantern, you know?"

     "Yes, yes," said Chillingworth; "I see you have it-- don't be in a 
hurry,
but do things deliberately and coolly whatever you do-- you will not be so
liable to make mistakes, or to leave anything undone."

     "There will be nothing of any use to you here, doctor, in the way of
dissection, for the flesh is one mass of decay.  What a horrible sight, to 
be
sure!"

     "It is; but hasten the search."

     "Well, I must; though, to confess the truth, I'd sooner handle anything
than this."

     "It is not the most pleasant thing in the world, for there is no 
knowing
what may be the result-- what creeping thing has made a home of it."

     "Don't mention anything about it."

     Henry and Charles Holland now began to search the pockets of the 
clothes
of the dead body, in one of which was something hard, that felt like a 
parcel.

     "What have you got there?" said Chillingworth, as he held his lantern 
up
so that the light fell upon the ghastly object that they were handling.

     "I think it is the prize," said Charles Holland; "but we have not got 
it
out yet, though I dare say it won't be long first, if this wind will but 
hold
good for about five minutes, and keep the stench down."

     They now tore open the packet and pulled out the papers, which appeared
to have been secreted upon his person.

     "Be sure there are none on any other part of the body," said
Chillingworth; "because what you do now, you had better do well, and leave
nothing to after thought, because it is frequently impracticable."

     "The advice is good," said Henry, who made a second search, but found
nothing.

     "We had better re-bury him," said the doctor; "it had better be done
cleanly.  Well, it is a sad hole for a last resting-place, and yet I do not
know that it matters-- it is all a matter of taste-- the fashion of the 
class,
or the particular custom of the country."

     There was but little to be said against such an argument, though the
custom of the age had caused them to look upon it more as a matter of 
feeling
than in such a philosophical sense as that in which the doctor had put it.

     "Well, there he is now-- shovel the earth in, Charles," said Henry
Bannerworth, as he himself set the example, which was speedily and 
vigorously
followed by Charles Holland, when they were not long before the earth was
thrown in and covered up with care, and trodden down so that it should not
appear to be moved.

     "This will do, I think," said Henry.

     "Yes; it is not quite the same, but I dare say no one will try to make
any discoveries in this place; besides, if the rain continues to come down
very heavy, why, it will wash much of it away, and it will make it look all
alike."

     There was little inducement to hover about the spot, but Henry could 
not
forbear holding up the papers to the light of the lantern to ascertain what
they were.

     "Are they all right?" inquired the doctor.

     "Yes," replied Henry, "yes.  The Deerbrook estate.  Oh! yes; they are 
the
papers I am in want of."

     "It is singularly fortunate, at least, to be so successful in securing
them.  I am very glad a living person has possession of them, else it would
have been very difficult to have obtained it from them."

     "So it would; but now homeward is the word, doctor; and on my word 
there
is reason to be glad, for the rain is coming on very fast now, and there is 
no
moon at all-- we had better step out."

     They did, for the three walked as fast as the nature of the soil would
permit them, and the darkness of the night.

 Next Time: Tells What Became of the Second Vampyre Who Sought Varney.




                               Chapter LXXXIX.

TELLS WHAT BECAME OF THE SECOND VAMPYRE WHO SOUGHT VARNEY.


     We left the Hungarian nobleman swimming down the stream; he swam 
slowly,
and used but little exertion in doing so.  He appeared to use his hands only
as a means of assistance.  The stream carried him onwards, and he sided
himself so far that he kept the middle of the stream, and floated along.

     Where the stream was broad and shallow, it sometimes left him a moment 
or
two, without being strong enough to carry him onwards; then he would pause, 
as
if gaining strength, and finally he would, when he had rested, and the water
came a little faster, and lifted him, make a desperate plunge, and swim
forward, until he again came in deep water, and then he went slowly along 
with
the stream, as he supported himself.

     It was strange thus to see a man going down slowly, and without any
effort whatever, passing through shade and through moonlight -- now lost in
shadow of the tall trees, and now emerging into that part of the stream 
which
ran through meadows and cornfields, until the stream widened, and then, at
length, a ferry-house was to be seen in the distance.

     Then came the ferryman out of his hut, to look upon the beautiful
moonlight scene.  It was cold, but pure, and brillantly light.  The chaste
moon was sailing through the heavens, and the stars diminished in their 
lustre
by the power of the luminous goddess of night.

     There was a small cottage -- true; it was somewhat larger than was
generally supposed by any casual observer who might look at it.  The place 
was
rambling, and built chiefly of wood; but in it there lived the ferryman, his
wife, and family; among these was a young girl of about seventeen years of
age, but, at the same time, very beautiful.

     They had been preparing their supper, and the ferryman himself walked 
out
to look at the river and the shadows of the tall trees that stood on the 
hill
opposite.

     While thus employed, he heard a plashing in the water, and on turning
towards the quarter whence the sound proceeded for a few yards, he came to 
the
spot where he saw the stranger struggling in the stream.

     "Good God!" he muttered to himself, as he saw the struggle continued;
"good God! he will sink and drown."

     As he spoke, he jumped into his boat and pushed it off, for the purpose
of stopping the descent of the body down the stream, and in a moment or two 
it
came near to him.  He muttered, --

     "Come, come-- he tries to swim; life is not gone yet-- he will do now, 
if
I can catch hold of him.  Swimming with one's face under the stream doesn't
say much for his skill, though it may account for the fact that he don't cry
out."

     As the drowning man neared, the ferryman held on by the boat-hook, and
stooping down, he seized the drowning man by the hair of the head, and then
paused.

     After a time, he lifted him up, and placed him across the edge of the
boat, and then, with some struggling of his own, he was rolled over into the
boat.

     "You are safe now," muttered the ferryman.

     The stranger spoke not, but sat or leaned against the boat's head,
sobbing and catching at his breath, and spitting off his stomach the water 
it
might be presumed he had swallowed.

     The ferryman put back to the shore, when he paussed, and secured his
boat, and then pulled the stranger out, saying, --

     "Do you feel any better now?"

     "Yes," said the stranger; "I feel I am living-- thanks to you, my good
friend; I owe you my life."

     "You are welcome to that," replied the ferryman; "it costs me nothing;
and, as for my little trouble, I should be sorry to think of that, when a
fellow-being's life was in danger."

     "You have behaved very well-- very well, and I can do little more now
than thank you, for I have been robbed of all I possessed about me at the
moment."

     "Oh! you have been robbed?"

     "Aye, truly, I have, and have been thrown into the water, and thus I 
have
been nearly murdered."

     "It is lucky you escaped from them without further injury," said the
ferryman; "but come in doors, you must be unfit to stand here in the cold."

     "Thank you; your hospitality is great, and, at this moment, of the
greatest importance to me."

     "Such as we have," said the honest ferryman, "you shall be welcome to. 
Come in-- come in."

     He turned round and led the way to the house, which he entered, saying 
--
as he opened the small door that led into the main apartment, where all the
family were assembled, waiting for the almost only meal they had had that
day,; for the ferryman had not the means, before the sun had set, of sending
for food, and then it was a long way before it could be found, and then it 
was
late before they could get it, --

     "Wife, we have a stranger to sleep with us to-night, and for whom we 
must
prepare a bed."

     "A stranger!" echoed the wife -- "a stranger, and we so poor!"

     "Yes; one whose life I have saved, and who was nearly drowned.  We 
cannot
refuse hospitality upon such an occasion as that, you know, wife."

     The wife looked at the stranger as he entered the room, and sat down by
the fire.

     "I am sorry," he said, "to intrude upon you; but I will make you amends
for the interruption and inconvenience I may cause you; but it is too late 
to
apply elsewhere, and yet I am doubtful, if there were, whether I could go 
any
further."

     "No, no," said the ferryman; "I am sure a man who has been beaten and
robbed, and thrown into a rapid and, in some parts, deep stream, is not fit 
to
travel at this time of night."

     "You are lonely about here," said the stranger, as he shivered by the
fire.

     "Yes, rather; but we are used to it."

     "You have a family, too; that must help to lighten the hours away, and
help you over the long evenings."

     "So you may think, stranger, and, at times, so it is; but when food 
runs
short, it is a long while to daylight, before any more money can be had.  To
be sure, we have fish in the river, and we have what we can grow in the
garden; but these are not all the wants that we feel, and those others are
sometimes pinching.  However, we are thankful for what we have, and complain
but little when we can get no more; but sometimes we do repine-- though I
cannot say we ought-- but I am merely relating the fact, whether it be right
or wrong."

     "Exactly.  How old is your daughter?"

     "She is seventeen come Allhallow's eve."

     "That is not far hence," said the stranger.  "I hope I may be in this
part of the country-- and I think I shall-- I will on that eve pay you a
visit; not one on which I shall be a burden to you, but one more useful to
you, and more consonant to my character."

     "The future will tell us all about that," said the ferryman; "at 
present
we will see what we can do, without complaining, or taxing anybody."

     The stranger and the ferryman sat conversing for some time before the
fire, and then the latter pointed out to him which was his bed -- one made 
up
near the fire, for the sake of its warmth; and then the ferryman retired to
the next room, a place which was merely divided by an imperfect partition.

     However, they all fell soundly asleep.  The hours on that day had been
longer than usual; there was not that buoyancy of spirit; when they retire,
they fell off into a heavy, deep slumber.

     From this they were suddenly aroused by loud cries and piercing screams
from one of the family.

     So loud and shrill were the cries, that they all started up, terrified
and bewildered beyond measure, unable to apply their faculties to any one
object.

     "Help-- help, father! -- help!" shrieked the voice of the young girl 
whom
we have before noticed.

     The ferryman jumped up, and rushed to the spot where his daughter lay.

     "Fanny," he said -- "Fanny, what ails thee-- what ails thee?  Tell me, 
my
dear child."

     "Oh!" she exclaimed, almost choked -- "oh, father! are we all alone?  I
am terrified."

     "What ails thee-- what ails thee?  Tell me what caused you to scream 
out
in such a manner?"

     "I-- I-- that is, father, thought-- but no, I am sure it was reality. 
Where is the stranger?"

     "A light-- a light!" shouted the fisherman.

     In another moment a light was brought him, and he discovered the 
stranger
reclining in his bed, but awake, and looking around him, as if in the utmost
amazement.

     "What has happened?" he said -- "what has happened?"

     "That is more than I know as yet," the man replied.  "Come, Fanny," he
added, "tell me what it is you fear.  What caused you to scream out in that
dreadful manner?"

     "Oh, father-- the vampyre!"

     "Great God! what do you mean, Fanny, by that?"

     "I hardly know, father.  I was fast asleep, when I thought I felt
something at my throat; but being very sound asleep, I did not immediately
awake.  Presently I felt the sharp pang of teeth being driven into the flesh
of my neck -- I awoke, and found the vampyre at his repast.  Oh, God! oh 
God!
what shall I do?"

     "Stay, my child, let us examine the wound," said the fisherman, and he
held the candle to the spot where the vampyre's teeth had been applied. 
There, sure enough, were teeth marks, such as a human being's would make 
were
they applied, but no blood had been drawn therefrom."

     "Come, come, Fanny, so far, by divine Providence, you are not injured;
another moment, and the mischief would have been done entire and complete, 
and
you would have been his victim."

     Then, turning to the stranger, he said, --

     "You have had some hand in this.  No human being but you could come 
into
this place.  The cottage door is secured.  You must be the vampyre."

     "I!"

     "Yes; who else could?"

     "I! -- As Heaven's my judge-- but there, it's useless to speak of it; I
have not been out of my bed.  In this place, dark as it is, and less used to
darkness than you, I could not even find my way about. -- It is impossible."

     "Get out of your bed, and let me feel," said the ferryman, peremptorily
-- "get out, and I will soon tell."

     The stranger arose, and began to dress himself, and the ferryman
immediately felt the bed on which he had been lying; but it was ice cold -- 
so
cold that he started upon his legs in an instant, exclaiming with vehemence,
--

     "It is you, vile wretch! that has attempted to steal into the cottage 
of
the poor man, and then to rob him of his only child, and that child of her
heart's blood, base ingrate!"

     "My friend, you are wrong, entirely wrong.  I am not the creature you
believe me.  I have slept, and slept soundly, and awoke not until your
daughter screamed."

     "Scoundrel! -- liar! -- base wretch! you shall not remain alive to 
injure
those who have but one life to lose."

     As he spoke, the ferryman made a desperate rush at the vampyre, and
seized him by the throat, and a violent struggle ensued, in which the 
superior
strength of the ferryman prevailed, and he brought his antagonist to the
earth, at the same time bestowing upon him some desperate blows.

     "Thou shalt go to the same element from which I took thee," said the
ferryman, "and there swim or sink as thou wilt until some one shall drag 
thee
ashore, and when they do, may they have a better return than I."

     As he spoke, he dragged along the stranger by main force until they 
came
to the bank of the river, and then pausing, to observe the deepest part, he
said, --

     "Here, then, you shall go."

     The vampyre struggled, and endeavoured to speak, but he could not; the
grasp at this throat prevented all attempts at speech; and then, with a 
sudden
exertion of his strength, the ferryman lifted the stranger up, and heaved 
him
some distance into the river.

     Then in deep water sank the body.

     The ferryman watched for some moments, and farther down the stream he 
saw
the body again rise upon the current and struggling slightly, as for life --
now whirled around and around, and then carried forward with the utmost
velocity.

     This continued as far as the moonlight enabled the ferryman to see, and
then, with a slow step and clouded brow, he returned to his cottage, which 
he
entered, and closed the door.

Next Time: Dr. Chillingworth at the Hall. -- The Encounter of Mystery. -- 
The
Confict. -- The Rescue, and the Picture.




                                 Chapter XC.

DR. CHILLINGWORTH AT THE HALL. -- THE ENCOUNTER OF MYSTERY. -- THE CONFLICT. 
-- THE RESCUE, AND THE PICTURE.


     There have been many events that have passed rapidly in this our
narrative; but more have yet to come before we can arrive at that point 
which
will clear up much that appears to be most mysterious and unaccountable.

     Doctor Chillingworth, but ill satisfied with the events that had yet
taken place, determined once more upon visiting the Hall, and there to 
attempt
a discovery of something respecting the mysterious apartment in which so 
much
has already taken place.

     He communicated his design to no one; he resolved to prosecute the
inquiry alone.  He determined to go there and await whatever might turn up 
in
the shape of events.  He would not for once take any companion; such
adventures were often best prosecuted alone -- they were most easily brought
to something like an explanatory position; one person can often consider
matters more cooly than more.  At all events, there is more secrecy than 
under
any other circumstances.

     Perhaps this often is of greater consequence than many others; and,
moreover, when there is more than one, something is usually overdone.  Where
one adventurous individual will rather draw back in a pursuit, more than one
would induce them to urge each other on.

     In fact, one in such a case could act the part of a spy-- a secret
observer; and in that case can catch people at times when they could not 
under
any other circumstances be caught or observed at all.

     "I will go," he muttered; "and should I be compelled to run away again,
why, nobody knows anything about it and nobody will laugh at me."

     This was all very well; but Mr. Chillingworth was not the man to run 
away
without sufficient cause.  But there was so much mystery in all this that he
felt much interested in the issue of the affair.  But this issue he could 
not
command; at the same time he was determined to sit and watch, and thus 
become
certain that either something or nothing was to take place.

     Even the knowledge of that much-- that some inexplicable action was 
still
going on-- was far preferable to the uncertainty of not knowing whether what
had once been going on was still so or not, because, if it had ceased, it 
was
probable that nothing more would ever be known concerning it, and the 
mystery
would still be a mystery to the end of time.

     "It shall be fathomed if there be any possibility of its being
discovered," muttered Chillingworth.  "Who would have thought that so quiet
and orderly a spot as this, our quiet village, would have suffered so much
commotion and disturbance?  Far from every cause of noise and strife, it is
quite as great a matter of mystery as the vampyre business itself.

     "I have been so mixed up in this business that I must go through with 
it. 
By the way, of the mysteries, the greatest that I have met with is the fact 
of
the vampyre having anything to do with so quiet a family as the 
Bannerworths."

     Mr. Chillingworth pondered over the thought; but yet he could make
nothing of it.  It in no way tended to elucidate anything connected with the
affair, and it was much too strange and singular in all its parts to be
submitted to any process of thought, with any hope of coming to anything 
like
a conclusion upon the subject-- that must remain until some facts were
ascertained, and to obtain them Mr. Chillingworth now determined to try.

     This was precisely what was most desirable in the present state of
affairs; while things remained in the present state of uncertainty, there
would be much more of mystery than could ever be brought to light.

     One or two circumstances cleared up, the minor ones would follow in the
same train, and they would be explained by the others; and if ever that 
happy
state of things were to come about, why, then there would be a perfect calm
in the town.

     As Mr. Chillingworth was going along, he thought he observed two men
sitting inside a hedge, close to a hay-rick, and thinking neither of them 
had
any business there, he determined to listen to their conversation, and
ascertain if it had any evil tendency, or whether it concerned the late 
event.

     Having approached near the gate, and they being on the other side, he 
got
over without any noise, and, unperceived by either of them, crept close up 
to
them.

     "So you haven't long come from sea?"

     "No; I have just landed."

     "How is it you have thrown aside your seaman's clothes and taken to
these?"

     "Just to escape being found out."

     "Found out! what do you mean by that?  Have you been up to anything?"

     "Yes, I have, Jack.  I have been up to something, worse luck to me; but
I'm not to be blamed either."

     "What is it all about?" inquired his companion.  "I always thought you
were such a steay-going old file that there was no going out of the even
path with you."

     "Nor would there have been, but for one simple circumstance."

     "What was that?"

     "I will tell you Jack-- I will tell you; you will never betray me, I am
sure."

     "Never, by heavens!"

     "Well, then, listen-- it was this.  I had been some time aboard our
vessel.  I had sailed before, but the captain never showed any signs of 
being
a bad man, and I was willing enough to sail with him again.

     "He knew I was engaged to a young woman in this country, and that I was
willing to work hard to save money to make up a comfortable home for us 
both,
and that I would not sail again, but that I intended to remain ashore, and
make up my mind to a shore life."

     "Well, you would have a house then?"

     "Exactly; and that's what I wished to do.  Well I made a small venture 
in
the cargo, and thought, by so doing, that I should have a chance of 
realizing
a sum of money that would put us both in a comfortable line of business.

     "Well, we went on very smoothly until we were coming back.  We had
disposed of the cargo, and I had received some money, and this seemed to
cause our captain to hate me, because I had been successful; but I thought
there was something else in it than that, but I could not tell what it was
that made him so intolerably cross and tyrannous.

     "Well, I found out, at length, he knew my intended wife.  He knew her
very well, and at the same time he made every effort he could to induce me 
to
commit some act of disobedience and insubordination; but I would not, for it
seemed to me he was trying all he could to prevent my doing my duty with
anything like comfort.

     "However, I learned the cause of all this afterwards.  It was told me 
by
one of the crew.

     "'Bill,' said my mate, 'look out for yourself.'

     "'What's in the wind?' said I.

     "'Only the captain has made a dead set at you, and you'll be a lucky 
man
if you escape.'

     "'What's it all about?' said I.  'I cannot understand what he means.  I
have done nothing wrong.  I don't see why I should suddenly be treated in 
this
way.'

     "'It's all about your girl, Bill.'

     "'Indeed!' said I.  "What can that have to do with the captain? he 
knows
nothing of her.'

     "'Oh, yes, he does,' he said.  'If it were not for you he would have 
the
girl himself.'

     "'I see now,' said I.

     "'Ay, and so can a blind man if you open his eyes; but he wants to make
you do wrong-- to goad you on to do something that will give him the power 
of
disgracing you, and, perhaps, of punishing you.'

     "'He won't do that,' said I.

     "'I am glad to hear you say so, Bill; for, to my mind, he has made up 
his
mind go the whole length against you.  I can't make it out, unless he wishes
you were dead.'

     "'I dare say he does,' said I; 'but I will take care I will live to 
exact
a reckoning when he comes ashore.'

     "'That is the best; and when we are paid off, Bill, if you will take it
out of him, and pay him off, why, I don't care if I lend you a hand.'

     "'We'll say more about that, Dick,' said I, 'when we get ashore and are
paid off.  If we are overheard now, it will be said that we are conspiring, 
or
committing mutiny, or something of that sort.'

     "'You are right, Bill,' he said-- 'you are right.  We'll say no more
about this now, but you may reckon upon me when we are no longer under his
orders.'

     "'Then there's no danger, you know.'

     "Well, we said nothing about this, but I thought of it, and I had cause
enough, too, to think of it; for each day the captain grew more and more
tyrannous and brutal.  I knew not what to do, but kept my resolution of 
doing
my duty in spite of all he could do, though I don't mind admitting I had 
more
than one mind to kill him and myself afterwards.

     "However, I contrived to hold out for another week or two, and then we
came into port, and were released froom his tyranny.  I got paid off, and 
then
I met my messmate, and we had some talk about the matter.

     "'The worst of it is,' said I, 'we shall have some difficulty to catch
him; and, if we can, I'll be sworn we shall give him enough to last him for 
at
least a voyage or two.'

     "'He ought to have it smart,' said my messmate; 'and I know where he is
to be found.'

     "'Do you? -- at what hour?'

     "'Late at night, when he may be met with as he comes from a house where
he spends his evenings.'

     "'That will be the best time in the world, when we shall have less
interference than at any other time in the day.  But we'll have a turn
to-night if you will be with me, as he will be able to make too good a
defence to one.  It will be a fight, and not a chastisement.'

     "'It will.  I will be with you; you know where to meet me.  I shall be 
at
the old spot at the usual time, and then we will go.'

     "We parted; and, in the evening, we both went together, and sought the
place where we should find him out, and set upon him to advantage.

     "He was nearly two hours before he came; but when he did come, we 
saluted
him with a rap on the head, that made him hold his tongue; and then we set 
to,
and gave him such a tremendous drubbing, that we left him insensible; but he
was soon taken away by some watchmen, and we heard that he was doing well; 
but
he was dreadfully beaten; indeed, it would take him some weeks before he 
could
be about in his duties.

     "He was fearfully enraged, and offered fifty pounds reward to any one 
who
could give him information as to who it was that assaulted him.

     "I believe he had a pretty good notion of who it was; but he could not
swear to me; but still, seeing he was busying himself too much about me, I 
at
once walked away, and went on my way to another part of the country."

     "To get married?"

     "Ay, and to get into business."

     "Then, things are not quite so bad as I thought for at first."

     "No-- no, not so bad but what they might have been worse a great deal;
only I cannot go to sea any more, that's quite certain."

     "You needn't regret that."

     "I don't know."

     "Why not know?  Are you not going to be married? -- ain't that much
better?"

     "I can't say," replied the sailor; "there's no knowing how my bargain 
may
turn out; if she does well, why, then the cruising is over; but nothing 
short
of that will satisfy me; for if my wife is at all not what I wish her to be,
why, I shall be off to sea."

     "I don't blame you, either; I would do so too, if it were possible; but
you see, we can't do so well on land as you do at sea; we can be followed
about from pillar to post, and no bounds set to our persecution."

     "That's true enough," said the other; "we can cut and run when we have
had enough of it.  However, I must get to the village, as I shall sleep 
there
to-night, if I find my quarters comfortable enough."

     "Come on, then, at once," said his companion; "it's getting dark now; 
and
you have no time to lose."

     These two now got up, and walked away towards the village; and
Chillingworth arose also, and pursued his way towards the Hall, while he
remarked to himself, --

     "Well-- well, they have nothing to do with that affair at all events. 
By-the-bye, I wonder what amount of females are deserted in the navy; they
certainly have an advantage over landsmen, in the respect of being tied to
tiresome partners; they can, at least, for a season, get a release from 
their
troubles, and be free at sea."

     However, Mr. Chillingworth got to the Hall, and unobserved, for he had
been especially careful not to be seen; he had watched on all sides, and no
signs of a solitary human being had he seen, that could in any way make the
slightest observation upon him.

     Indeed, he had sheltered himself from observation at every point of his
road, especially so when near Bannerworth Hall, where there were plenty of
corners to enable him to do so; and when he arrived there, he entered at the
usual spot, and then sat down a few moments in the bower.

     "I will not sit here," he muttered.  "I will go and have a watch at 
that
mysterious picture; there is the centre of attraction, be it what it may."

     As he spoke, he arose and walked into the house, and entered the same
apartment which has been so often mentioned to the reader.

     Here he took a chair, and sat down full before the picture, and began 
to
contemplate it.

     "Well, for a good likeness, I cannot say I ever saw anything more
unprepossessing.  I am sure such a countenance as that could never have won 
a
female heart.  Surely, it is more calculated to terrify the imagination, 
than
to soothe the affections of the timid and shrinking female.

     "However, I will have an inspection of the picture, and see if I can 
make
anything of it."

     As he spoke, he put his hand upon the picture with the intention of
removing it, when it suddenly was thrust open, and a man stepped down.

     The doctor was for a moment completely staggered, it was so utterly
unexpected, and he stepped back a pace or two in the first emotion of his
surprise; but this soon passed by, and he prepared to close with his
antagonist, which he did without speaking a word.

     There was a fair struggle for more than two or three minutes, during
which the doctor struggled and fought most manfully; but it was evident that
Mr. Chillingworth had met with a man who was his superior in point of
strength, for he not only withstood the utmost force that Chillingworth 
could
bring against him, but maintained himself, and turned his strength against 
the
doctor.

     Chillingworth panted with exertion, and found himself gradually losing
ground, and was upon the point of being thrown down at the mercy of his
adversary, who appeared to be inclined to take all advantages of him, when 
an
occurrence happened that altered the state of affairs altogether.

     While they were struggling, the doctor borne partially to the earth --
but yet struggling, suddenly his antagonist released his hold, and staggered
back a few paces.

     "There, you swab-- take that; I am yard-arm and yard-arm with you, you
piratical-looking craft-- you lubberly, buccaneering son of a fish-fag."

     Before, however, Jack Pringle, for it was he who came so opportunely to
the rescue of Doctor Chillingworth, could find time to finish the sentence, 
he
found himself assailed by the very man who, but a minute before, he had, as 
he
thought, placed _hors de combat_.

     A desperate fight ensued, and the stranger made the greatest efforts to
escape with the picture, but found he could not get off without a desperate
struggle.  He was, at length, compelled to relinquish the hope of carrying
that off, for both Mr. Chillingworth and Jack Pringle were engaged hand to
hand; but the stranger struck Jack so heavy a blow on the head, that made 
him
reel a few yards, and then he escaped through the window, leaving Jack and 
Mr.
Chillingworth masters of the field, but by no means unscathed by the 
conflict
in which they had been engaged.

 Next Time: The Grand Consultation Broken Up By Mrs. Chillingworth, and the
 Disappearance of Varney.




                                Chapter XCI.

THE GRAND CONSULTATION BROKEN UP BY MRS CHILLINGWORTH, AND THE DISAPPEARANCE
OF VARNEY.


     Remarkable was the change that had taken place in the circumstances of
the Bannerworth family.  From a state of great dispondency, and, indeed,
absolute poverty, they had suddenly risen to comfort and independence.

     It seemed as if the clouds that had obscured their destiny, had now, 
with
one accord, dissipated, and that a brighter day was dawning.  Not only had 
the
circumstances of mental terror which had surrounded them given way in a 
great
measure to the light of truth and reflection, but those pecuniary distresses
which had pressed upon them for a time, were likewise passing away, and it
seemed probable that they would be a prosperous condition.

     The acquisition of the title deeds of the estate, which they thought 
had
passed away from the family for ever, became to them, in their present
circumstances, an immense acquisition, and brought to their minds a feeling 
of
great contentment.

     Many persons in their situation would have been extremely satisfied at
having secured so strong an interest in the mind of the old admiral, who was
very wealthy, and who, from what he had already said and done, no doubt 
fully
intended to provided handsomely for the Bannerworth family.

     And not only had they this to look forward to, if they had chosen to
regard it as an advantage, but they knew that by the marriage of Flora with
Charles Holland she would have a fortune at her disposal, while he (Charles)
would be the last man in the world to demur at any reasonable amount of it
being lavished upon her mother and her brothers.

     But all this did not suit the high and independent spirit of Henry
Bannerworth.  He was one who would rather have eaten the crust that he
procured for himself by some meritorious exertion, than have feasted on the
most delicate viands placed before him from the resources of another.

     But now that he knew this small estate, the title deeds of which had 
been
so singularly obtained, had once really belonged to the family, but had been
risked and lost at the gaming-table, he had no earthly scruple in calling 
such
property again his own,

     As to the large sum of money which Sir Francis Varney in his 
confessions
had declared to have found its way into the possession of Marmaduke
Bannerworth, Henry did not expect, and scarely wished to become possessed of
wealth through so tainted a source.

     "No," he said to himself frequently; "no-- I care not if that wealth be
never forthcoming, which was so badly got possession of.  Let it sink into 
the
earth, if, indeed, it be buried there; or let it rot in some unknown corner 
of
the old mansion.  I care not for it."

     In this view of the case he was not alone, for a family more unselfish,
or who cared so little for money, could scarcely have been found; but 
Admiral
Bell and Charles Holland argued now that they had a right to the amount of
money which Marmaduke Bannerworth had hidden somewhere, and the old admiral
reasoned upon it rather ingeniously, for he said, --

     "I suppose you don't mean to dispute that the money belongs to 
somebody,
and in that case I should like to know who else it belonged to, if not to 
you?
 How do you get over that, master Henry?"

     "I don't attempt to get over it at all," said Henry; "all I say is, 
that
I do dislike the whole circumstances connected with it, and the manner in
which it was come by; and, now that we have a samll independence, I hope it
will not be found.  But, admiral, we are going to hold a family consultation
as to what we shall do, and what is to become of Varney.  He has convinced 
me
of his relationship to our family, and, although his conduct has certainly
been extremely equivocal, he has made all the amends in his power; and now, 
as
he is getting old, I do not like to throw him upon the wide world for a
subsistence."

     "You don't contemplate," said the admiral, "letting him remain with 
you,
do you?"

     "No; that would be objectionable for a variety of reasons; and I could
not think of it for a moment."

     "I should think not.  The idea of sitting down to breakfast, dinner, 
tea,
and supper with a vampyre, and taking your grog with a fellow that sucks 
other
people's blood!"

     "Really, admiral, you do not really still cling to the idea that Sir
Francis Varney is a vampyre."

     "I really don't know; he clings to it himself, that's all I can say; 
and
I think, under those circumstances,  I might as well give him the benefit of
his own proposition, and suppose that he is a vampyre."

     "Really, uncle," said Charles Holland, "I did think that you had
discarded the notion."

     "Did you?  I have been thinking of it, and it ain't so desirable to be 
a
vampyre, I am sure, that any one should pretend to it who is not; therefore, 
I
take the fellow upon his own showing.  He is a vampyre in his own opinion, 
and
so I don't see, for the life of me, why he should not be so in ours."

     "Well," said Henry, "waving all that, what are we to do with him? 
Circumstances seem to have thrown him completely at our mercy.  What are we 
to
do with him, and what is to become of him for the future?"

     "I'll tell you what I'll do," said the admiral.  "If he were ten times 
a
vampyre, there is some good in the fellow; and I will give him enough to 
live
upon if he will go to America and spend it.  They will take good care there
that he sucks no blood out of them; for, although an American would always
rather lose a drop of blood than a dollar, they keep a pretty sharp look out
upon both."

     "The proposal can be made to him," said Henry, "at all events.  It is 
one
which I don't dislike, and probably one that he would embrace at once; 
because
he seems, to me, to have completely done with ambition, and to have 
abandoned
those projects concerning which, at one time, he took such a world of
trouble."

     "Don't you trust to that," said the admiral.  "What's bred in the bone
don't so easily get out of the flesh; and once or twice, when Master Varney
has been talking, I have sen those odd looking eyes of his flash up for a
moment, as if he were quite ready to begin his old capers again, and alarm 
the
whole country side."

     "I must confess," said Charles Holland, "that I myself have had the
impression once or twice that Varney was only subdued for a time, and that,
with a proper amount of provocation, he would become again a very serious
fellow, and to the full as troublesome as he has been."

     "Do you doubt his sincerity?" said Henry.

     "No, I do not do that, Henry.  I think Varney fully means what he says;
but I think, at the same time, that he has for so long lead a strange, wild,
and reckless life, that he will find it very far from easy, if indeed
possible, to shake off his old habits and settle down quietly, if not to say
comfortably."

     "I regret," said Henry, "that you have such an impression, but, while I
do so, I cannot help admitting that it is, to a considerable extent, no more
than a reasonable one; and perhaps, after all, my expectation that Varney 
will
give us no more trouble, only amounts to a hope that he will not do so, and
nothing more.  But let us consider; there seems to be some slight difference
of opinion among us, as to whether we should take up our residence at this 
new
house of ours, which we did not know we owned, at Dearbrook, or proceed to
London, and there establish ourselves, or again return to Bannerworth Hall,
and, by a judicious expenditure of some money, make that a more habitable
place than it has been for the last twenty years."

     "Now, I'll tell you what," said the admiral, "I would do.  It's quite 
out
of the question for any body to live long unless they see a ship; don't you
think so, Miss Flora?"

     "Why, how can you ask Flora such a question, uncle," said Charles
Holland, "when you know she don't care a straw about ships, and only looks
upon admirals as natural curiosities?"

     "Excepting one," said Flora, "and he is an admiral who is natural but 
no
curiosity, unless it be that you can call him such because he is so just and
generous; and, as for ships, who can help admiring them; and if Admiral Bell
proposes that we live in some plesant, marine villa by the sea-coast, he 
shall
have my vote and interest for the proceeding."

     "Bravo! Huzza!" cried the admiral.  "I tell you what it is, Master
Charley-- you horse marine, -- I have a great mind to cut you out, and have
Miss Flora myself."

     "Don't, uncle," said Charles; "that would be so very cruel, after she 
has
promised me so faithfully.  How do you suppose I should like it; come now, 
be
merciful."

     At this moment, and before any one could make another remark, there 
came
rather a sharp ring at the garden-gate bell, and Henry exclaimed, --

     "That's Mr. Chillingworth, and I am glad he has come in time to join 
our
conference.  His advice is always valuable; and, moreover, I rather think he
will bring us some news worth the hearing."

     The one servant who they had to wait upon them looked into the room, 
and
said, --

     "If you please, here is Mrs. Chillingworth."

     "Mistress? you mean Mr."

     "No; it is Mrs. Chillingworth and her baby."

     "The devil!" said the admiral; "what can she want?"

     "I'll come and let you know," said Mrs. Chillingworth, "what I want;" 
and
she darted into the room past the servant.  "I'll soon let you know, you 
great
sea crab.  I want my husband; and what with your vampyre, and one thing and
another, I haven't had him at home an hour for the last three weeks.  What 
am
I to do?  There is all his patients getting well as fast as they can without
him; and, when they find that out, do you think they will take any more 
filthy
physic?  No, to be sure not; people ain't such fools as to do anything of 
the
sort."

     "I'll tell you what we will do, ma'am," said the admiral; "we'll all 
get
ill at once, on purpose to oblige ye; and I'll begin by having the measles."

     "You are an old porpoise, and I believe it all owing to you that my
husband neglects his wife and family.  What's vampyres to him, I should like
to know, that he should go troubling about them?  I never heard of vampyres
taking draughts and pills."

     "No, nor any body else that had the sense of a goose," said the 
admiral;
"but if it's your husband you want, ma'am, it's no use your looking for him
here, for here he is not."

     "Then where is he?  He is running after some of your beastly vampyres
somewhere, I'll be bound, and you know where to send for him."

     "Then you are mistaken; for, indeed, we don't.  We want him ourselves,
ma'am, and can't find him-- that's the fact."

     "It's all very well talking, sir, but if you were a married woman, with 
a
family about you, and the last at the breast, you'd feel very different from
what you do now."

     "I'm d----d if I don't suppose I should," said the admiral; "but as for
the last, ma'am, I'd soon settle that.  I'd wring its neck, and shove it
overboard."

     "You would, you brute?  It's quite clear to me you never had a child of
your own."

     "Mrs. Chillingworth," said Henry, "I think you have no right to 
complain
to us of your domestic affairs.  Where your husband goes, and what he does, 
is
at his own will and pleasure, and, really, I don't see that we are to be 
made
answerable as to whether he is at home or abroad; to say nothing of the bad
taste-- and bad taste it most certainly is, of talking of your private 
affairs
to other people."

     "Oh, dear!" said Mrs. Chillingworth; "that's your idea, is it, you no-
whiskered puppy?"

     "Really, madam, I cannot see what my being destitute of whiskers has to
do with the affair; and I am inclined to think my opinion is quite as good
without them as with them."

     "I will speak," said Flora, "to the doctor, when I see him."

     "Will you, Miss Doll's-eyes?  Oh, dear me! you'll speak to the doctor,
will you?"

     "What on earth do you want?" said Henry.  "For your husband's sake, 
whom
we all respect, we wish to treat you with every imaginable civility; but we
tell you, candidly, that he is not here, and, therefore, we cannot conceive
what more you can require of us."

     "Oh, it's a row," said the admiral; "that's what she wants-- woman 
like. 
D----d a bit do they care what it's about as long as there's a disturbance. 
And now, ma'am, will you sit down and have a glass of grog?"

     "No, I will not sit down; and all I can say is, that I look upon this
place as a den full of snakes and reptiles.  That's my opinion; so I'll not
stay any longer; but, wishing that great judgments may some day come home to
you all, and that you may know what it is to be a mother, with five babies,
and one at the breast, I despise you all and leave you."

     So saying, Mrs. Chillingworth walked from the place, feeling herself
highly hurt and offended at what had ensued; and they were compelled to let
her go just as she was, without giving her any information, for they had a
vivid recollecion of the serious disturbance she had created on a former
occasion, when she had actually headed a mob, for the purpose of hunting out
Varney, the vampyre, from Bannerworth Hall, and putting an end consequently,
as she considered, to that set of circumstances which kept the doctor so 
much
from his house, to the great detriment of a not very extensive practice.

     "After all," said Flora, "Mrs. Chillingworth, although she is not the
most refined person in the world, is to be pitied."

     "What!" cried the admiral;  "Miss Doll's-eyes, are you taking her 
part?"

     "Oh, that's nothing.  She may call me what she likes."

     "I believe she is a good wife to the doctor," said Henry,
"notwithstanding her little eccentricities; but suppose we now at once make
the proposal we were thinking of to Sir Francis Varney, and so get him to
leave England as quickly as possible and put an end to the possibility of 
his
being any more trouble to anybody."

     "Agreed-- agreed.  It's the best thing that can be done, and it will be
something gained to get his consent at once."

     "I'll run up stairs to him," said Charles, "and call him down at once.  
I
scarcely doubt for a moment his acquiescence in the proposal."

     Charles Holland rose, and ran up the little staircase of the cottage to
the room which, by the kindness of the Bannerworth family, had been devoted 
to
the use of Varney.  He had not been gone above two minutes, when he 
returned,
hastily, with a small scrap of paper in his hand, which he laid before 
Henry,
saying, --

     "There, what think you of that?"

     Henry, upon taking up the paper, saw written upon it the words, --

     "_The Farewell of Varney the Vampyre._"

     "He is gone," said Charles Holland.  "The room is vacant.  I saw at a
glance that he had removed his hat, and cloak, and all that belonged to him. 
He's off, and at so short a warning, and in so abrupt a manner, that I fear
the worst."

     "What can you fear?"

     "I scarcely know what; but we have a right to fear everything and
anything from this most inexplicable being, whose whole conduct has been of
that mysterious nature, as to put him past all calculation as regards his
motives, his objects, or his actions.  I must confess that I would have 
hailed
his departure from England with feelings of satisfaction; but what he means
now, by this strange manoeuvre, Heaven, and his own singular intellect, can
alone divine."

     "I must confess," said Flora, "I should not at all have thought this of
Varney.  It seems to me as if something new must have occurred to him. 
Altogether, I do not feel any alarm concerning his actions as regards us.  I
am convinced of his sincerity, and, therefore, do not view with sensations 
of
uneasiness this new circumstance, which appears at present so inexplicable,
but for which we may yet get some explanation that will be satisfactory to 
us
all."

     "I cannot conceive," said Henry, "what new circumstances could have
occurred to produce this effect upon Varney.  Things remain just as they 
were;
and, after all, situated as he is, if any change had taken place in matters
out of doors, I do not see how he could become acquainted with them, so that
his leaving must have been a matter of mere calculation, or of impulse at 
the
moment-- Heaven knows which-- but can have nothing to do with actual
information, because it is quite evident he could not get it."

     "It is rather strange," said Charles Holland, "that just as we were
speculating upon the probability of his doing something of this sort, he
should suddenly do it, and in this singular manner too."

     "Oh," said the old admiral, "I told you I saw his eye, that was enough
for me.  I knew he would do something, as well as I know a mainmast from a
chain cable.  He can't help it; it's in the nature of the beast, and that's
all you can say about it."

 Next Time: The Misadventure of the Doctor with the Picture.




                                Chapter XCII.

THE MISADVENTURE OF THE DOCTOR WITH THE PICTURE.


     The situation of Dr. Chillingworth and Jack Pringle was not of that
character that permitted much conversation or even congratulation.  They 
were
victors it was true, and yet they had but little to boast of besides the
victory.

     Victory is a great thing; it is like a gilded coat, it bewilders and
dazzles.  Nobody can say much when you are victorious.  What a sound! and 
yet
how much misery is there not hidden beneath it.

     This victory of the worthy doctor and his aid amounted to this, they 
were
as they were before, without being any better, but much the worse, seeing 
they
were so much buffetted that they could hardly speak, but sat for some 
moments
opposite to each other, gasping for breath, and staring each other in the 
face
without speaking.

     The moonlight came in through the window and fell upon the floor, and
there were no sounds that came to disturb the stillness of the scene, nor 
any
object that moved to cast a shadow upon the floor.  All was still and
motionless, save the two victors, who were much distressed and bruised.

     "Well!" said Jack Pringle, with a hearty execration, as he wiped his 
face
with the back of his hand; "saving your presence, doctor, we are masters of
the field, doctor; but it's plaguey like capturing an empty bandbox after a
hard fight."

     "But we have got the picture, Jack-- we have got the picture, you see,
and that is something.  I am sure we saved that."

     "Well, that may be; and a pretty d--d looking picture it is after all. 
Why, it's enough to frighten a lady into the sulks.  I think it would be a
very good thing if it were burned."

     "Well," said the doctor, "I would sooner see it burned than in the 
hands
of that ---"

     "What?" exclaimed Jack.

     "I don't know," said Mr. Chillingworth; "but thief I should say, for it
was somewhat thief-like to break into another man's house and carry off the
furniture."

     "A pirate-- a regular land shark."

     "Something that is not the same as an honest man, Jack; but, at all
events, we have beaten him back this time."

     "Yes," said Jack, "the ship's cleared; no company is better than bad
company, doctor."

     "So it is, and yet it don't seem clear in terms.  But, Jack, if you
hadn't come in time, I should have been but scurvily treated.  He was too
powerful for me; I was as nigh being killed as ever I have been; but you 
were
just in time to save me."

     "Well, he was a large, ugly fellow, sure enough, and looked like an old
tree."

     "Did you see him?"

     "Yes, to be sure I did."

     "Well, I could not catch a glimpse of his features.  In fact, I was too
much employed to see anything, and it was much too dark to notice anything
particular, even if I had had leisure."

     "Why, you had as much to do as you could well manage, I must say that, 
at
all events.  I didn't see much of him myself; only he was a tall,
out-of-the-way sort of chap-- a long-legged shark.  He gave me such a dig or
two as I haven't had for a long while, nor don't want to get again; though I
don't care if I face the devil himself.  A man can't do more than do his 
best,
doctor."

     "No, Jack; but there are very few who do do their best, and that's the
truth.  You have, and have done it to some purpose too.  But I have had 
enough
for one day; he was almost strong enough to contend against us both."

     "Yes, so he was."

     "And, besides that, he almost carried away the picture-- that was a 
great
hindrance to him.  Don't you think we could have held him if we had not been
fighting over the picture?"

     "Yes, to be sure we could; we could have gone at him boldly, and held
him.  He would not have been able to use his hands.  We could have hung on
him, and I am sure if I came to grapple yard-arm and yard-arm, he would have
told a different tale; however, that is neither here nor there.  How long 
had
you been here?"

     "Not very long," replied the doctor, whose head was a little confused 
by
the blows which he had received.  "I can't now tell how long, but only a 
short
time, I think."

     "Where did he come from?" inquired Jack.

     "Come from, Jack?"

     "Yes, doctor, where did he came from? -- the window, I suppose-- the 
same
way he went out, I dare say-- it's most likely."

     "Oh, no, no; he come down from behind the picture.  There's some 
mystery
in that picture, I'll swear to it; it's very strange he should make such a 
desperate attempt to carry it away."

     "Yes; one would think," said Jack, there was more in it than we can 
see--
that it is worth more than we can believe; perhaps somebody sets particular
store by it."

     "I don't know," said Mr. Chillingworth, shaking his head, "I don't know
how that may be; but certain it is, the picture was the object of his visit
here-- that is very certain."

     "It was; he was endeavouring to carry it off," said Jack; "it would be 
a
very good ornament to the black hole at Calcutta."

     "The utility of putting it where it cannot be seen," remarked Mr.
Chillingworth, "I cannot very well see; though I dare say it might be all 
very
well."

     "Yes-- its ugly features would be no longer seen; so far, it would be a
good job.  But are you going to remain here all night, and so make a long
watch of it, doctor?"

     "Why, Jack," said the doctor, "I did intend watching here; but now the
game is disturbed, it is of no use remaining here.  We have secured the
picture, and now there will be no need of remaining in the house; in fact,
there is no fear of robbery now."

     "Not so long as we are here," said Jack Pringle; "the smugglers won't
show a head while the revenue cutter is on the look out."

     "Certainly not, Jack," said Mr. Chillingworth; "I think we have scared
them away-- the picture is safe."

     "Yes-- so long as we are here."

     "And longer, too, I hope."

     Jack shook his head, as much as to intimate that he had many doubts 
upon
such a point, and couldn't be hurried into any concession of opinion of the
safety of such a picture as that-- much as he disliked it, and as poor an
opinion as he had of it.

     "Don't you think it will be safe?"

     "No," said Jack.

     "And why not?" said Mr. Chillingworth, willing to hear what Jack could
advance against the opinion he had expressed, especially as he had disturbed
the marauder in the very act of robbery.

     "Why, you'll be watched by this very man; and when you are gone, he 
will
return in safety, and take this plaguey picture away with him."

     "Well, he might do so," said Mr. Chillingworth, after some thought; "he
even endangered his own escape for the purpose of carrying it off."

     "He wants it," said Jack.

     "What, the picture?"

     "Aye, to be sure; do you think anybody would have tried so hard to get
away with it?  He wants it; and the long and the short of it is, he will 
have
it, despite all that can be done to prevent it; that's my opinion."

     "Well, there is much truth in that; but what to do I don't know."

     "Take it to the cottage," suggested Jack.  "The picture must be more 
than
we think for; suppose we carry it along."

     "That is no bad plan of yours, Jack," said Mr. Chillingworth; "and,
though a little awkward, yet it is not the worst I have heard; but-- but--
what will they say, when they see this frightful face in that quiet, yet
contented house?"

     "Why, they'll say you brought it," said Jack; "I don't see what else 
they
can say, but that you have done well; besides, when you come to explain, you
will make the matter all right to 'em."

     "Yes, yes," said Chillingworth; "and, as the picture now seems to be 
the
incomprehensible object of attack, I will secure that, at all events."

     "I'll help you."

     "Thank you, Jack; your aid will be welcome; at least, it was so just
now."

     "All right, doctor," said Jack.  "I may be under your hands some day."

     "I'll physic you for nothing," said Mr. Chillingworth.  "You saved my
life.  One good turn deserves another; I'll not forget."

     "Thank you," said Jack, as he made a wry face.  "I hope you won't have
occasion.  I'd sooner have a can of grog than any bottle of medicine you can
give me; I ain't ungrateful, neither."

     "You needn't name it; I am getting my breath again.  I suppose we had
better leave this place, as soon as we conveniently can."

     "Exactly.  The sooner the better; we can take it the more leisurely as
we go."

     The moon was up; there were no clouds now, but there was not a very
strong light, because the moon was on the wane.  It was one of those nights
during which an imperceptible vapour arises, and renders the moon somewhat
obscure, or, at least, it robs the earth of her rays; and then there were
shadows cast by the moon, yet they grew fainter, and those cast upon the
floor of the apartment were less distinct than at first.

     There seemed scarce a breath of air stirring; everything was quiet and
still; no motion-- no sound, save that of the breathing of the two who sat 
in
that mysterious apartment, who gazed alternately round the place, and then 
in
each other's countenances.  Suddenly, the silence of the night was disturbed
by a very slight, but distinct noise, which struck upon them with peculiar
distinctness; it was a gentle tap, tap, at the window, as if some one was
doing it with their fingernail.

     They gazed on each other, for some moments, in amazement, and then at 
the
window, but they saw nothing; and yet, had there been anything, they must 
have
seen it, but there was not even a shadow.

     "Well," said Mr. Chillingworth, after he had listened to the tap, tap,
several times, without being able to find out or imagine what it could arise
from, "what on earth can it be?"

     "Don't know," said Jack, very composedly, squinting up at the window. 
"Can't see anything."

     "Well, but it must be something," persisted Mr. Chillingworth; "it must
be something."

     "I dare say it is; but I don't see anything.  I can't think what it can
be, unless---"

     "Unless what?  Speak out," said the doctor, impatiently.

     "Why, unless it is Davy Jones himself, tapping with his long
finger-nails, a-telling us how we've been too long already here."

     "Then, I presume, we may as well go; and yet I am more disposed to deem
it some device of the enemy to dislodge us from this place, for the purpose
of enabling them to effect some nefarious scheme or other they have afloat."

     "It may be, and is, I dare say, a do of some sort or other," said Jack; 
"but what can it be?"

     "There it is again," said the doctor; "don't you hear it?  I can, as
plain as I can hear myself."

     "Yes, said Jack; "I can hear it plain enough, and can see it, too; and
that is more."  Yes, yes, I can tell all about it plain enough."

     "You can?  Well, then, shew me," said the doctor, as he strode up to 
the
window, before which Jack was standing gazing upon one particular spot of 
the
shattered window with much earnestness.

     "Where is it?"

     "Look there," said Jack, pointing with his finger to a particular spot,
to which the doctor directed his attention, expecting to see a long, skinny
hand tapping against the glass; but he saw nothing.

     "Where is it?"

     "Do you see that twig of ivy, or something of the sort?" inquired Jack.

     "Yes, I do."

     "Very well, watch that; and when the wind catches it-- and there is but
very little-- it lifts it up, and then, falling down again, it taps the
glass."

     Just as he spoke, there came a slight gust of wind; and it gave a
practical illustration to his words; for the tapping was heard as often as 
the
plant was moved by the wind.

     "Well," said Mr. Chillingworth, "however simple and unimportant the
matter may be, yet I cannot but say I am always well pleased to find a
practical explanation of it, so that there will be no part left in doubt."

     "There is none about that," said Jack.

     "None.  Well, we are not beset, then.  We may as well consider of the
manner of our getting clear of this place.  What sort of burthen this 
picture
may be I know not; but I will make the attempt to carry it."

     "Avast, there," said Jack; "I will carry it; at all events, I'll take 
the
first spell, and, if I can't go on, we'll turn and turn about."

     "We can divide the weight from the first, and then neither of us will 
be
tired at all."

     "Just as you please, sir," said Jack Pringle.  "I am willing to obey
orders; and, if we are to get in to-night before they are all a-bed, we had
better go at once; and then we shall not disturb them."

     "Good, Jack," said Mr. Chillingworth; "very good: let us begin to beat
our retreat at once."

     "Very good," said Jack.

     They both rose and approached the picture, which stood up in one 
corner,
half reclining against the wall; the light, at least so much as there was,
fell upon it, and gave it a ghastly and deathly hue, which made Mr.
Chillingworth feel an emotion he could not at all understand; but, as soon 
as
he could, he withdrew his eyes from off the picture, and they proceeded to
secure it with some cord, so that they might carry it between them the 
easier
-- with less trouble and more safety.

     These prepartions did not take long in making, and, when completed, 
they
gave another inquiring look round the chamber, and Mr. Chillingworth again
approached the window, and gazed out upon the garden below, but saw nothing 
to
attract his attention.

     Turning away, he came to the picture, with which Jack Pringle had been
standing.  They proceeded towards the stairs, adopting every precaution they
could take to prevent any surprise and any attempt upon the object of their
solicitude.

     Then they came to the great hall, and, having opened the door, they
carried it out; then shutting the door, they both stood outside of 
Bannerworth
Hall; and, before taking the picture up in their hands, they once more 
looked
suspiciously around them.

     There was nothing to be seen, and so, shouldering the ominous portrait,
they proceeded along the garden till they conveyed it into the roadway.

     "Now," said Jack, "we are off; we can scud along under press of sail, 
you
know."

     "I would rather not," said the doctor, "for two reasons; one of which 
is,
I can't do it myself, and the other is, we should run the risk of injuring
the picture; besides this, there is no reason for so doing."

     "Very well," said Jack, "make it agreeable to yourself, doctor.  See 
you,
Jack's alive, and I am willing to do all I can to help you."

     "I am very glad of your aid," said Mr. Chillingworth; "so we will 
proceed
slowly.  I shall be glad when we are there; for there are few things more
awkward than this picture to carry."

     "It is not heavy," said Jack, giving it a hitch up, that first pulled 
the
doctor back, and then pushed him forward again.

     "No; but stop, don't do that often, Jack, or else I shall be obliged to
let go, to save myself from falling," said the doctor.

     "Very sorry," said Jack; "hope it didn't inconvenience you; but I could
carry this by myself."

     "And so could I," returned Mr. Chillingworth; "but the probablility is
there would be some mischief done to it, and then we should be doing more 
harm
than good."

     "So we should," said Jack.

     They proceeded along with much care and caution.  It was growing late
now, and no one was about-- at least, they met none.  People did not roam
about much after dark, especially since the reports of the vampyre became
current, for, notwithstanding all their bravery and violence while in a 
body,
yet to meet and contend with him singly, and unseen, was not at all a 
popular
notion among them; indeed, they would sooner go a mile out of their way, or
remain in doors, which they usually did.

     The evening was not precisely dark; there was moonlight enough to save 
it
from that, but there was a mist hanging about, that rendered objects, at a
short distance, very indistinct.

     There walk was uninterrupted by any one, and they had got through half
the distance without any disturbance of interruption whatever.

     When they arrived at the precincts of the village, Jack Pringle said to
Dr. Chillingworth.

     "Do you intend going through the village, doctor?"

     "Why, not? there will be nobody about, and if there should be, we shall
be safe enough from any molestation, seeing there are none here who would 
dare
to harm us; it is the shortest way, too."

     "Very good," said Jack; "I am ageeable, and as for any one harming me,
they know better; but, at all events, there's company, and there's less
danger, you know, doctor; though I'm always company to myself, but haven't 
any
objection to a messmate, now and then."

     They pursued their way in silence, for some distance, the doctor not
caring about continuing the talk of Jack, which amounted to nothing; 
besides;
he had too much to do, for, notwithstanding the lightness of the picture,
which Jack had endeavoured to persuade the doctor of, he found it was heavy
and ungainly; indeed, had he been by himself he would have had some trouble
to have got it away.

     "We are nearly there," said Jack, putting down his end of the picture,
which brought Doctor Chillingworth to a stand still.

     "Yes, we are; but what made you stop?"

     "Why, you see," said Jack, giving his trowsers a hitch, "as I said
before, we are nearly there."

     "Well, what of that? we intended to go there, did we not?" inquired
Chillingworth.

     "Yes, exactly; that is, you intended to do so, I know, but I didn't."

     "What do you mean by that?" inquired Chillingworth; "you are a complete
riddle to-night, Jack; what is the matter with you?"

     "Nothing; only, you see, I don't want to go into the cottage, 'cause, 
you
see, the admiral and I have had what you may call a bit of a growl, and I am
in disgrace there a little, though I don't know why, or wherefore; I always
did my duty by him, as I did by my country.  The ould man, however, takes 
fits
into his head; at the same time I shall take some too; Jack's as good as his
master, ashore, at all events."

     "Well, then, you object to go in?" said Chillingworth.

     "That is the state of the case; not that I'm afraid, or have any cause 
to
be ashamed of myself; but I don't want to make anybody else uncomfortable, 
by
causing black looks."

     "Very well, Jack," said the doctor.  "I am much obliged to you, and, if
you don't like to come, I won't press you against your inclination."

     "I understand, doctor.  I will leave you here, if you can manage the 
rest
of the way by yourself; there are not two hundred yards now to go, so you 
are
all safe; so good bye."

     "Good bye, Jack," said Doctor Chillingworth, who stood wiping his
forehead, whilst the picture was standing up against the pales.

     "Do you want a hand up first?"

     "No, thank you; I can get it up very well without any trouble-- it's 
not
so heavy."

     "Good bye, then," said Jack; and, in a few moments more, Jack Pringle 
was
out of sight, and the doctor was alone with the ominous picture.  He had not
far to go, and was within hail of the cottage; but it was late, and yet he
believed he should find them up, for the quietude and calmness of the 
evening
hour was that which most chimed with their feelings.  At such a time they
could look out upon the face of nature, and the freedom of thought appeared
the greater, because there was no human being to clash with the silence and
stillness of the scene.

     "Well," muttered Chillingworth, "I'll go at once to the cottage with my
burthen.  How they will look at me, and wonder what could induce me to bring
this away.  I can hardly help smiling at the thought of how they will look 
at
the apparition I shall make."

     Thus filled with notions that appeared to please him, the doctor
shouldered the picture, and walked slowly along until he reached the dead 
wall
that ran up to the entrance, or nearly so, of the gardens.

     There was a plantation of young trees that overhung the path, and cast 
a
deep shadow below -- a pleasant spot in hot weather.

     The doctor had been carrying the picture, resting the side of it on the
small of his arm, and against his shoulder; but this was an inconvenient
posture, because the weight of the picture cut his arm so much, that he was
compelled to pause, and shift it more on his shoulder.

     "There," he muttered, "that will do for the present, and last until I
reach the cottage garden."

     He was proceeding along at a slow and steady pace, bestowing all his 
care
and attention to the manner of holding the picture, when he was suddenly
paralysed by the sound of a great shout of such a peculiar character, that 
he
involuntarily stopped, and the next moment, something heavy came against him
with great force, just as if a man had jumped from the wall on to him.

     This was the truth, for, in another moment, and before he could recover
himself, he found that there was an attempt to deprive him of the picture.

     This at once aroused him, and he made an instant and a vigorous 
defence;
but he was compelled to let go his hold of the picture, and turn to resist 
the
infuriated attack that was now commenced upon himself.

     For some momemts it was doubtful who would be the victor; but the wind
and strength of the doctor were not enough to resist the powerful adversary
against whom he had to contend, and the heavy blows that were showered down
upon him.

     At first he was enabled to bear up against this attack; and then he
returned many of the blows with interest; but the stunning effect of the 
blows
he received himself, was such that he could not help himself, and felt his
senses gradually failing, his strength becoming less and less.

     In a short time, he received such a blow, that he was laid senseless on
the earth in an instant.

     How long he remained thus he could not say; but it could not have been
long, for all around him seemed just as it was before he was attacked.

     The moon had scarely moved, and the shadows, such as they were, were
falling in the same direction as before.

     "I have not been long here," he muttered, after a few moments'
reflection; "but-- but---"
     
     He stopped short; for, on looking around him, he saw the object of his
solicitude was gone.  The picture was nowhere to be seen.  It had been 
carried
off the instant he had been vanquished.

     "Gone!" he said, in a low, disconsolate tone; "and after all I have
done!"

     He wiped his hand across his brow, and finding it cut, he looked at the
back of his hand, and saw by the deep colour that it was blood; indeed, he
could now feel it trickle down his face.

     What to do he hardly knew; he could stand, and after having got upon 
his
feet, he staggered back against the wall, against which he leaned for 
support,
and afterwards he crept along with the aid of its support, until he came to
the door.

     He was observed from the window, where Henry and Charles Holland, 
seeing
him come up with such an unsteady gait, rushed to the door to ascertain what
was the matter.

     "What, doctor!" exclaimed Henry Bannerworth; "what is the matter?"

     "I am almost dead, I think," said Chillingworth.  "Lend me your arm,
Henry."

     Henry and Charles Holland immediately stepped out, and took him between
them into the parlour, and placed him upon a couch.

     "What on earth has happened, doctor? -- have you got into disgrace with
the populace?"

     "No, no; give me some drink-- some water.  I am very faint-- very 
faint."

     "Give him some wine, or, what's better, some grog," said the admiral. 
"Why, he's been yard-arm with some pirate or other, and he's damaged about 
the
figure-head.  You ain't hurt in your lower works, are you, doctor?" said the
admiral.

     But the doctor took no notice of the inquiry; but eagerly sipped the
contents of a glass that Charles Holland had poured out of a bottle 
containing
some strong Hollands, and which appeared to nerve him much.

     "There!" said the admiral, "that will do you good.  How did all this
damage to your upper works come about, eh?"

     "Let him wash his face and hands first; he will be better able to talk
afterwards."

     "Oh, thank you," said Chillingworth.  "I am much better; but I have had
some hard bruises."

     "How did it happen?"

     "I went by myself to watch in the room where the picture was in
Bannerworth Hall."

     "Where the picture was!" said Henry; "where it is, you mean, do you 
not,
doctor?"

     "No; where it was, and where it is not now."

     "Gone!"

     "Yes, gone away; I'll tell you all about it.  I went there to watch, 
but
found nobody or nothing there; but suddenly a man stepped out from behind 
the
picture, and we had a fight over it; after which, just as I was getting the
worst of it, Jack Pringle came in."

     "The dog!" muttered the admiral.

     "Yes, he came in just in time, I believe, to save my life; for the man,
whoever he was, would not have hesitated about it."

     "Well, Jack is a good man," said the admiral; "there may be worse, at
least."

     "Well, we had a desperate encounter for some minutes, during which this
fellow wanted to carry off the picture."

     "Carry off the picture?"

     "Yes, we had a struggle for that; but we could not capture him; he was
so violent that he broke away and got clear off."

     "With the picture?"

     "No, he left the picture behind.  Well, we were very tired and bruised,
and we sat down to recover ourselves from our fatigue, and to consider what
was best to be done; but we were some time before we could leave, and then 
we
determined that we would take the picture away with us, as it seemed to be
coveted by the robber, for what object we cannot tell."

     "Well, well-- where is the picture?"

     "You shall hear all about it in a minute, if you'll let me take my 
time. 
I am tired and sore.  Well, we brought the picture out, and Jack helped me
carry it till he came within a couple of hundred yards of the cottage, and
there left me."

     "The lubber!" said the admiral, interjectionally.

     "Well, I rested awhile, and then taking the picture on my shoulders, I
proceeded along with it until I came to the wall, when suddenly I heard a
great shout, and then down came something heavy upon me, just as if a man 
had
jumped down upon me."

     "And-- and---"

     "Yes," said the doctor, "it was---"

     "Was what?" inquired the admiral.

     "Just what you all seemed to anticipate; you are all before me, but 
that
was it."

     "A man?"

     "Yes; I had a struggle with him, and got nearly killed, for I am not
equal to him in strength.  I was sadly knocked about, and finally all the
senses were knocked out of me, and I was, I suppose, left for dead."

     "And what became of the picture?"

     "I don't know; but I suppose it was taken away, as, when I came to
myself, it was gone; indeed, I have some faint recollection of seeing him
seize the portrait as I was falling."

     There was a pause of some moments, during which all the party appeared 
to
be employed with their own thoughts, and the whole were silent.

     "Do you think it was the same man who attacked you in the house that
obtained the picture?" at last inquired Henry Bannerworth.

     "I cannot say, but I think it most probable that it was the same; 
indeed,
the general appearance, as near as I could tell in the dark, was the same; 
but
what I look upon as much stronger is, the object appears to be the same in
both cases."

     "That is very true," said Henry Bannerworth-- "very true; and I think 
it
more than probable myself.  But come, doctor, you will require rest and
nursing after your dangers."

 Next Time: The Alarm at Anderbury. -- The Suspicions of the Bannerworth
 Family, and the Mysterious Communication.




                               Chapter XCIII.

THE ALARM AT ANDERBURY. -- THE SUSPICIONS OF THE BANNERWORTH FAMILY, AND THE
MYSTERIOUS COMMUNICATION.


     About twenty miles to the southward of Bannerworth Hall was a good-
sized
market-town, called Anderbury.  It was an extensive and flourishing place, 
and
from the beauty of its situation, and its contiguity to the southern coast 
of
England, it was much admired; and, in consequence, numerous mansions and
villas of great pretension had sprang up in its immediate neighbourhood.

     Besides, there were some estates of great value, and one of these, 
called
Anderbury-on-the-Mount, in consequence of the mansion itself, which was of 
an
immense extent, being built upon an eminence, was to be let, or sold.

     This town of Anderbury was remarkable not only for the beauty of its
aspect, but likewise for the quiet serenity of its inhabitants, who were a
prosperous, thriving race, and depended very much upon their own resources.

     There were some peculiar circumstances why Anderbury-on-the-Mount was 
to
let.  It had been for a great number of years in possession of a family of 
the
name of Milltown, who had resided there in great comfort and respectablity,
until an epidemic disorder broke out, first among the servants, and then
spreading to the junior branches of the family, and from them to their
seniors, produced such devastation, that in the course of three weeks there
was but one young man left of the whole family, and he, by native vigour of
constitution, had baffled the disorder, and found himself alone in his
ancestral halls, the last of his race.

     Soon a settled melancholy took possession of him, and all that had
formerly delighted him now gave him pain, inasmuch as it brought to his mind 
a
host of recollections of the most agonising character.

     In vain was it that the surrounding gentry paid him every possible
attention, and endeavoured to do all that was in their power to alleviate 
the
unhappy circumstances in which he was placed.  If he smiled, it was in a sad
sort, and that was very seldom; and at length he announced his intention of
leaving the neighbourhood, and seeking abroad, and in change of scene, for
that solace which he could not expect to find in his ancestral home, after
what had occurred within its ancient walls.

     There was not a chamber but which reminded him of the past -- there was
not a tree or a plant of any kind or description but which spoke to him
plainly of those who were now no more, and whose merry laughter had within 
his
own memory made that ancient place echo with glee, filling the sunny air 
with
the most gladsome shouts, such as come from the lips of happy youth long
before the world has robbed it of any of its romance or its beauty.

     There was a general feeling of regret when this young man announced the
fact of his departure to a foreign land; for he was much respected, and the
known calamities which he had suffered, and the grief under which he 
laboured,
invested his character with a great and painful interest.

     An entertainment was given to him upon the eve of his departure, and on
the next day he was many miles from the place, and the estate of Anderbury-
on-
the-Mount was understood to be sold or let.

     The old mansion had remained, then, for a year or two vacant, for it 
was
a place of too much magnitude, and required by far too expensive an
establishment to keep it going, to enable any person whose means were not 
very
large to think of having anything to do with it.

     So, therefore, it remained unlet, and wearing that gloomy aspect which 
a
large house, untenanted, so very quickly assumes.

     It was quite a melancholy thing to look upon it, and to think what it
must have once been, and what it might be still, compared to what it 
actually
was; and the inhabitants of the neighbourhood had made up their minds that
Anderbury-on-the-Mount would remain untenanted for many a year to come, and,
perhaps, ultimately fall into ruin and decay.

     But in this they were doomed to be disappointed, for, on the evening of
a dull and gloomy day, about one week after the events we have recorded as
taking place at Bannerworth Hall and its immediate neighbourhood, a 
travelling
carriage, with four horses and an out-rider, came dashing into the place, 
and
drew up at the principal inn in the town, which was called the Anderbury 
Arms.

     The appearance of such an equipage, although not the most unusual thing
in the world, in consequence of the many aristocratic families who resided 
in
the neighbourhood, caused, at all events, some sensation, and, perhaps, the
more so because it drove up to the inn instead of to any of the mansions of
the neighbourhood, thereby showing that the stranger, whoever he was, came 
not
as a visitor, but either merely baited in the town, being on his road
somewhere else, or had some special business in it which would soon be
learned.

     The out-rider, who was in handsome livery, had gallopped on in advance 
of
the carriage a short distance, for the purpose of ordering the best 
apartments
in the inn to be immediately prepared for the reception of his master.

     "Who is he?" asked the landlord.

     "It's the Baron Stolmuyer Saltsburgh."

     "Bless my heart, I never heard of him before; where did he come from--
somewhere abroad I suppose?"

     "I can't tell you anything of him further than that he is immensely 
rich,
and is looking for a house.  He has heard that there is one to let in this
immediate neighbourhood, and that's what has brought him from London, I
suppose."

     "Yes, there is one; and it is called Anderbury-on-the-Mount."

     "Well, he will very likely speak to you about it himself, for here he
comes."

     By this time the carriage had halted at the door of the hotel, and, the
door being opened, and the steps lowered, there alighted from it a tall man
attired in a kind of pelisse, or cloak, trimmed with rich fur, the body of 
it
being composed of velvet.  Upon his head he wore a travelling cap, and his
fingers, as he grasped the cloak around him, were seen to be covered with
rings of great value.

     Such a personage, coming in such style, was, of course, likely to be
honoured in every possible way by the landlord of the inn, and accordingly 
he
was shown most obsequiously to the handsomest apartment in the house, and 
the
whole establishment was put upon the alert to attend to any orders he might
choose to give.

     He had not been long in the place when he sent for the landlord, who,
hastily scrambling on his best coat, and getting his wife to arrange the tie
of his neckcloth, proceeded to obey the orders of his illustrious guest,
whatever they might chance to be.

     He found the Baron Stolmuyer reclining upon a sofa, and having thrown
aside his velvet cloak, trimmed with rich fur, he showed that underneath it
he wore a costume of great richness and beauty, although, certainly, the 
form
of it covered was not calculated to set it off to any great advantage, for 
the
baron was merely skin and bone, and looked like a man who had just emerged
from a long illness, for his face was ghastly pale, and the landlord could 
not
help observing that there was a strange peculiarity about his eyes, the 
reason
of which he could not make out.

     "You are the landlord of this inn, I presume," said the baron, "and,
consequently, no doubt well acquainted with the neighbourhood?"

     "I have the honour to be all that, sir.  I have been here about sixteen
years, and in that time I certainly ought to know something of the
neighbourhood."

     "'Tis well; some one told me there was a little cottage sort of place 
to
let here, and as I am simple and retired in my habits I thought that it 
might
possibly suit me."

     "A little cottage, sir!  There are certainly little cottages to let, 
but
not such as would suit you; and if I might have presumed, sir, to think, I
should have considered Anderbury-on-the-Mount, which is now to let, would 
have
been the place for you.  It is a large place, sir, and belonged to a good
family, although they are now all dead and gone, except one, and it's he who
want's to let the old place."

     "Anderbury-on-the-Mount," said the baron, "was the name of the place
mentioned to me; but I understood it was a little place."

     "Oh! sir, that is quite a mistake; who told you so?  It's the largest
place about here; there are a matter of twenty-seven rooms in it, and it
stands altogether upon three hundred acres of ground."

     "And have you the assurance," said the baron, "to call that anything 
but
a cottage, when the castle of the Stolmuyers, at Saltzburgh, has one suite 
of
reception rooms thirty in number, opening into each other, and the total
number of apartments in the and whole building is two hundred and sixty, it 
is
surrounded by eight miles of territory."

     "The devil!" said the landlord.  "I beg your pardon, sir, but when I am
astonished, I generally say the devil.  They want eight hundred pounds a 
year
for Anderbury-on-the-Mount."

     "A mere trifle.  I will sleep here to-night, and in the morning I will 
go
and look at the place.  It is near the sea?"

     "Half a mile, sir, exactly, from the beach; and one of the most curious
circumstances of all connected with it is, that there is a subterranean
passage from the grounds leading right away down to the sea-coast.  A most
curious place, sir, partly put out of the cliff, with cellars in it for 
wine,
and other matters, that in the height of summer are kept as cool as in the
deep winter time.  It's more for curiosity than use, such a place; and the 
old
couple, that now take care of the house, make a pretty penny, I'll be bound,
though they won't own it, by showing that part of the place."

     "It may suit me, but I shall be able to give a decisive answer when I 
see
it on the morrow.  You will let my attendants have what they require, and 
see
that my horses be well looked to."

     "Certainly, oh! certainly sir, or course; you might go far, indeed, 
sir,
before you found an inn where everything would be done as things are done
here.  Is there anything in particular, sir, you would like for dinner?"

     "How can I tell that, idiot, until the dinner time arrives?"

     "Well, but, sir, in that case, you know, we scarcely know what to do,
because you see, sir, you understand---"

     "It is very strange to me that you can neither see nor understand your
duty.  I am accustomed to having the dinner tables spread with all that 
money
can procure; then I choose, but not before, what it suits me to partake of."

     "Well, sir, that is a very good way, and perhaps we ain't quite so used
to that sort of thing as we ought to be in these parts; but another time, 
sir,
we shall know better what we are about, without a doubt, and I only hope, 
sir,
that we shall have you in the neighbourhood for a long time; and so, sir,
putting one thing to another, and then drawing a conclusion from both of 
them,
you see, sir, you will be able to understand."

     "Peace! begone! what is the use of all this bellowing to me-- I want it
not-- I care not for it."

     The baron spoke these words so furiously, that the landlord was rather
terrified than otherwise, and left the room hastily, muttering to himself 
that
he had never come across such a tiger, and wondering where the baron could
have possibly come from, and what amount of wealth he could be possessed of
that would enable him to live in such a princely style as he mentioned.

     If the Baron Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh had wished ever so much to impress
upon the minds of all persons in the neighbourhood the fact of his wealth 
and
importance, he could not have adopted a better plan to accomplish that 
object
than by first of all impressing such facts upon the mind of the landlord of
the Anderbury Arms, for in the course of another hour it was tolerably well
spread all over the town, that never had there been such a guest at the
Anderbury Arms; and that he called Anderbury-on-the-Mount, with all its 
rooms
-- all its outbuildings, and its three hundred acres of ground, a cottage.

     This news spread like wildfire, awaking no end of speculation, and 
giving
rise to the most exaggerated rumours, so that a number of persons came to 
the
inn on purpose to endeavour to get a look at the baron; but he did not stir
from his apartments, so that these wondermongers were disappointed, and even
forced to go away as wise as they came; but in the majority of cases they 
made
up their minds that in the morning they should surely be able to obtain a
glimpse of him, which was considered a great treat, for a man with an 
immense
income is looked upon in England as a natural curiosity.

     The landlord took his guest at his word as regards the dinner, and
provided such a repast as seldom, indeed, graced the board at the Anderbury
Arms -- a repast sufficient for twenty people, and certainly which was a
monstrous thing to set before one individual.

     The baron, however, made no remark, but selected a portion from some of
the dishes, and those dishes that he did select from, were of the simplest
kind, and not such as the landlord expected him to take, so that he really
paid about one hundred times the amount he ought to have done for what
actually passed his lips.

     And then what a fidget the landlord was in about his wines, for he
doubted not but such a guest would be extremely critical and hard to please;
but, to his great relief, the baron declined taking any wine, merely washing
down his repast with a tumbler of cool water; and then, although the hour 
was
very early, he retired at once to rest.

     The landlord was not disposed to disregard the injunction which the 
baron
had given him to attend carefully on his servants and horses, and after 
giving
orders that nothing should be stinted as regarded the latter, he himself
looked to the creature comforts of the former, and he did this with a double
motive, for not only was he anxious to make the most he could out of the 
baron
in the way of charges, but he was positively panting with curiosity to know
more about so singular a personage, and he thought that surely the servants
must be able to furnish him with some particulars regarding their eccentric
master.

     In this, however, he was mistaken, for although they told him all they
knew, that amounted to so little as really not to be worth the learning.

     They informed him that they had been engaged all in the last week, and
that they knew nothing of the baron whatever, or where he came from, or what
he was, excepting that he paid them most liberal wages, and was not very
exacting in the service he required of them.

     This was very unsatisfactory, and when the landlord started on a 
mission,
which he considered himself bound to perform, to a Mr. Leek, in the town, 
who
had the letting of Anderbury-on-the-Mount, he was quite vexed to think what 
a
small amount of information he was able to carry to him.

     "I can tell him," he said to himself as he went quickly towards the
agent's residence; "I can tell him the baron's name, and that in the morning
he wants to look at Anderbury-on-the-Mount; but that's all I know of him,
except that he is a most extraordinary man-- indeed, the most extraordinary
that I ever came near."

     Mr. Leek, the house agent, notwithstanding the deficiency of the facts
contained in the landlord's statement, was well enough satisfied to hear 
that
any one of apparent wealth was inquiring after the large premises to let, 
for,
as he said truly to the landlord, --

     "The commission on letting and receiving the rentals of such a property
is no joke to me."

     "Precisely," said the landlord.  "I thought it was better to come and
tell you at once, for there can be no doubt that he is enormously rich."

     "If that be satisfactorily proved, it's of no consequence what he is, 
or
who he is, and you may depend I shall be round to the inn early in the 
morning
to attend upon him; and in that case, perhaps, if you have any conversation
with him, you will be so good as to mention that I will show him over the
premises at his own hour, and you shall not be forgotten, you may depend, if
any arrangement is actually come to.  It will be just as well for you to 
tell
him what a nice property it is, and that it is to be let for eight hundred a
year, or sold outright for eight thousand pounds."

     "I will, you may depend, Mr. Leek.  A most extraordinary man you will
find him; not the handsomest in the world, I can tell you, but handsome is 
as
handsome does, say I; and, if he takes Anderbury-on-the-Mount, I have no
doubt but he will spend a lot of money in the neighbourhood, and we shall 
all
be the better of that, of course, as you well know, sir."

     This then was thoroughly agreed upon between these high contracting
powers, and the landlord returned home very well satisfied, indeed, with the
position in which he had put the affair, and resolved upon urging on the
baron, as far as it lay within his power so to do, to establish himself in 
the
neighbourhood, and to allow him to be purveyor-in-general to his household,
which, if the baron continued in his liberal humour, would be unquestionably
a very pleasant post to occupy.

 Next Time: The Visitor, and the Death in the Subterranean Passage.




                                Chapter XCIV.

THE VISITOR, AND THE DEATH IN THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE.


     About an hour and a half after the baron had retired to rest, and while
the landlord was still creeping about enjoining silence on the part of the
establishment, so that the slumbers of a wealthy and, no doubt, illustrious
personage should not be disturbed, there arrived a horseman at the Anderbury
Arms.

     He was rather a singular-looking man, with a shifting, uneasy-looking
glance, as if he were afraid of being suddenly pounced upon and surprised by
some one; and although his apparel was plain, yet it was good in quality, 
and
his whole appearance was such as to induce respectful attention.

     The only singular circumstance was, that such a traveller, so well
mounted, should be alone; but that might have been his own fancy, so that 
the
absence of an attendant went for nothing.  Doubtless, if the whole inn had 
not
been in such a commotion about the illustrious and wealthy baron, this
stranger would have received more consideration and attention than he did.

     Upon alighting, he walked at once into what is called the coffee-room 
of
the hotel, and after ordering some refreshments, of which he partook but
sparingly, he said, in a mild but solemn sort of tone, to the waiter who
attended upon him, --

     "Tell the Baron Stolmuyer, of Saltzburgh, that there is one here who
wants to see him."

     "I beg your pardon, sir," said the waiter, "but the baron is gone to
bed."

     "It matters not to me.  If you nor no one else in this establishment 
will
deliver the message I charge you with, I must do so myself."

     "I'll speak to my master, sir; but the baron is a very great gentleman
indeed, and I don't think my master would like to have him disturbed."

     The stranger hesitated for a time, and then he said, --

     "Show me the baron's apartment.  Perhaps I ought not to ask any one
person connected with this establishment to disturb him, when I am quite
willing to do so myself.  Show me the way."

     "Well, but, sir, the baron may get in a rage, and say, very naturally,
that we had no business to let anybody walk up to his room and disturb him,
because we wouldn't do so ourselves.  So that you see, sir, when you come to
consider, it hardly seems the right sort of thing."

     "Since," said the stranger, rising, "I cannot procure even the common
courtesy of being shown to the apartment of the person whom I seek, I must
find him myself."

     As he spoke he walked out of the room and began ascending the 
staircase,
despite the remonstrances of the waiter, who called after him repeatedly, 
but
could not induce him to stop; and when he found that such was the case, he
made his way to the landlord, to give the alarm that, for all he knew to the
contrary, some one had gone up stairs to murder the baron.

     This information threw the landlord into such a fix, that he knew not
what to be at.  At one moment he was for rushing up stairs and endeavouring
to interfere, and at another he thought the best plan would be to pretend
that he knew nothing about it.

     While he was in this state of uncertainty, the stranger succeeded in
making his way up stairs to the floor from which proceeded the bedrooms, 
and,
apparently, having no fear whatever of the Baron Stolmuyer's indignation
before his eyes , he opened door after door, until he came to one which led
him into the apartment occupied by that illustrious individual.

     The baron, half undressed only, lay in an uneasy slumber upon the bed,
and the stranger stood opposite to him for some minutes, as if considering
what he should do.

     "It would be easy," he said, "to kill him; but it will pay me better to
spare him.  I may be wrong in supposing that he has the means which I hope 
he
has; but that I shall soon discover by his conversation."

     Stretching out his hand, he tapped the baron lightly on the shoulder, 
who
thereupon opened his eyes and sprang to his feet instantly, glancing with
fixed earnestness at the intruder, upon whose face shone the light of a lamp
which was burning in the apartment.

     Then the baron shrank back, and the stranger, folding his arms, said, -
-

     "You know me.  Let our interview be as brief as possible.  There needs 
no
explanations between us, for we both know all that could be said.  By some
accident you have become rich, while I continue quite otherwise.  It matters
not how this has occurred, the fact is everything.  I don't know the amount
of your possessions; but, from your style of living, they must be great, and
therefore it is that I make no hesitation in asking of you, as a price for
not exposing who and what you are, a moderate sum."

     "I thought that you were dead."

     "I know you did; but you behold me here, and, consequently, that 
delusion
vanishes."

     "What sum do you require, and what assurance can I have that, when you
get it, the demand will not be repeated on the first opportunity?"

     "I can give you no such assurance, perhaps, that would satisfy you
entirely; but, for more reasons than I choose to enter into, I am extremely
anxious to leave England at once and for ever.  Give me the power to do so
that I require, and you will never hear of me again."

     The baron hesitated for some few seconds, during which he looked
scrutinizingly at his companion, and then he said, in a tone of voice that
seemed as if he were making the remark to himself rather than to the other, 
--

     "You look no older than you did when last we parted, and that was years
ago."

     "Why should I look older?  You know as well as I that I need not.  But,
to be brief, I do not wish to interfere with any plans or projects you may
have on hand.  I do not wish to be a hindrance to you.  Let me have five
thousand pounds, and I am off at once and for ever, I tell you."

     "Five thousand! the man raves-- five thousand pounds!  Say one 
thousand,
and it is yours."

     "No; I have fixed my price; and if you do not consent, I now tell you
that I will blazon forth, even in this house, who and what you are; and, let
your schemes of ambition or of cupidity be what they may, you may be assured
that I will blast them all."

     "This is no place in which to argue such a point; come out into the 
open
air; 'walls have ears;' but come out, and I will give you such special 
reasons
why you should not now press your claim at all, that you shall feel much
beholden to me for them, and not regret your visit."

     "If that we come to terms, I no more desire than you can do that any 
one
should overhear our conversation.  I prefer the open air for any conference,
be it whatever it may-- much prefer it; and therefore most willingly embrace
your proposition.  Come out."

     The baron put on his travelling cap, and the rich velvet cloak, edged
with fur, that he possessed, and leaving his chamber a few paces in advance 
of
his strange visitor, he descended the staircase, followed by him.  In the 
hall
of the hotel they found the landlord and almost the whole of the 
establishment
assembled, in deep consultation as to whether or not any one was to go up
stairs and a certain if the stranger who had sought the baron's chamber was
really a friend or an enemy.

     But when they saw the two men coming down, at all events apparently
amicably, it was a great relief, and the landlord rushed forward and opened
the door, for which piece of service he got a very stately bow from the 
baron,
and a slight inclination of the head from his visitor, and then they both
passed out.

     "I have ascertained," said the man who came on horseback, "that for the
last week in London you have lived in a style of the most princely
magnificence, and that you came down here, attended as if you were one of 
the
first nobles of the land."

     "These things amuse the vulgar," said the baron.  "I do not mind
admitting to you that I contemplate residing on this spot, and perhaps
contracting a marriage."

     "Another marriage?"

     "And why not?  If wives will die suddenly, and no one knows why, who is
to help it.  I do not pretend to control the fates."

     "This, between us, is idle talk indeed-- most idle; for we know there 
are
certain circumstances which account for the strangest phenomena; but what
roaring sound is that which comes so regularly and steadily upon the ear."

     "It is the sea washing upon the coast.  The tide is no doubt advancing,
and, as the eddying surges roll in upon the pebbly shore, they make what, to
my mind, is this pleasant music."

     "I did not think we were so near the ocean.  The moon is rising; let us
walk upon the beach, and as that sound is such pleasant music, you shall 
hear
it while I convince you what unpleasant consequences will arise from a 
refusal
of the modest and moderate terms I offer you."

     "We shall see, we shall see; but I must confess it does seem to me most
extraordinary that you ask of me a positive fortune, for fear you should
deprive me of a portion of one; but you cannot mean what you say."

     While they were talking they reached a long strip of sand which was by
the seashore, at the base of some cliffs, through which was excavated the
passage from the coast into the grounds of Anderbury House, and which had 
been
so expatiated upon by the landlord of the inn, in his description of the
advantages attendant upon that property.

     There were some rude steps, leading to a narrow arched door-way, which
constituted an entrance to this subterraneous region; and as the moonlight
streamed over the wide waste of waters, and fell upon this little door-way 
in
the face of the cliff, he became convinced that it was the entrance to that
excavation, and he eyed it curiously.

     "What place is that?" said his companion.

     "It is a private entrance to the grounds of a mansion in this
neighbourhood."

     "Private enough, I should presume; for if there be any other means of
reaching the house, surely no one would go through such a dismal hole as 
that
towards it; but come, make up your mind at once.  There need be no 
quarrelling
upon the subject of our conference, but let it be a plain matter of yes or 
no. 
Is it worth your while to be left alone in peace, or is it not?"

     "It is worth my while, but not at such a price as that you mentioned; 
and
I cannot help thinking that some cheaper mode of accomplishing the same 
object
will surely present itself very shortly."

     "I do not understand you; you talk ambiguously."

     "But my acts," said the baron, "shall be clear and plain enough, as you
shall see.  Could you believe it possible that I was the sort of person to
submit timely to any amount of extortion you chose to practise upon me.  
There
was a time when I thought you possessed great sense and judgment, when I
thought that you were a man who weighed well the chances of what you were
about; but now I know to the contrary; and I think for less than a thousand
pounds I may succeed in ridding myself of you."

     "I do not understand you; you had better beware how you tamper with me,
for I am not one who will be calmly disposed to put up with much.  The 
sense,
tact, and worldly knowledge which you say you have before, from time to 
time,
given me credit for, belongs to me still, and I am not likely easily to 
commit
myself."

     "Indeed; do yo think you bear such a charmed life that nothing can 
shake
it?"

     "I think nothing of the sort; but I know what I can do-- I am armed."

     "And I; and since it comes to this, take the reward of your villany; 
for
it was you who made me what I am, and would now seek to destroy my every 
hope
of satisfaction."

     As the baron spoke he drew from breast a small pistol, which, with the
quickness of thought, he held full in the face of his companion, and pulled
the trigger.

     There can be no doubt on earth but that his intention was to commit the
murder, but the pistol missed fire, and he was defeated in his intention at
that moment.  Then the stranger laughed scornfully, and drawing a pistol 
from
his pocket, he presented it at the baron's head, saying, --

     "Do I not bear a charmed life?  If I had not, should I have escaped 
death
from you now?  No, I could not; but you perceive that even a weapon that 
might
not fail you upon another occasion is harmless against me; and can you 
expect
that I will hesitate now to take full and ample revenge upon you for this
dastardly attempt?"

     These words were spoken with great volubility, so much so, indeed, that
they only occupied a few very brief seconds in delivering; and then, 
perhaps,
the baron's career might have ended, for it seemed to be fully the intention
of the other to conclude what he said by firing the pistol in his face; but
the wily aspect of the baron's countenance was, after all, but a fair index 
of
the mind, and, just as the last words passed the lips of his irritated
companion, he suddenly dropped in a crouching position to the ground, and,
seizing his legs, threw him over his head in an instant.

     The pistol was discharged, at the same moment, and then, with a shout 
of
rage and satisfaction, the baron sprang upon his foe, and, kneeling upon his
breast, he held aloft in his hand a glittering dagger, the highly-polished
blade of which caught the moonbeams, and reflected them into the dazzled 
eyes
of the conquered man, whose fate now appeared to be certain.

     "Fool!" said the baron, "you must needs, then, try conclusions with me,
and, not content with the safety of insignificance, you must be absurd 
enough
to think it possible you could extort from me whatever sums your fancy
dictated, or with any effect threaten me, if I complied not with your
desires."

     "Have mercy upon me.  I meant not to take your life; and, therefore, 
why
should you take mine?"

     "You would have taken it, and, therefore, you shall die.  Know, too, at
this your last moment, that, vampyre as you are, and as I, of all men, best
know you to be, I will take especial care that you shall be placed in some
position after death where the revivifying moonbeams may not touch you, so
that this shall truly be your end, and you shall rot away, leaving no trace
behind of your existence, sufficient to contain the vital principle."

     "No-- no! you cannot-- will not.  You will have mercy."

     "Ask the famished tiger for mercy, when you intrude upon his den."

     As he spoke the baron ground his teeth together with rage, and, in an
instant, buried the poniard in the throat of his victim.  The blade went
through to the yellow sand beneath, and the murderer still knelt upon the
man's chest, while he who had thus received so fatal a blow tossed his arms
about with agony, and tried in vain to shriek.

     The nature of the wound, however, prevented him from utttering anything
but a low gurgling sound, for he was nearly choked with his own blood, and
soon his eyes became fixed and of a glassy appearance; he stretched out his
two arms, and dug his fingrs deep into the sand.

     The baron drew forth the poniard, and a gush of blood immediately
followed it, and then one deep groan testified to the fact, that the spirit,
if there be a spirit, had left its mortal habitation, and winged its flight 
to
other realms, if there be other realms for it to wing its flight to.

     "He is dead," said the baron, and, at the same moment, a roll of the
advancing tide swept over the body, drenching the living, as well as the 
dead,
with the brine of the ocean.

     The baron stooped and rinced the dagger in the advancing tide from the
clotted blood which had clung to it, and then, wiping it carefully, he
returned it to its sheath, which was hidden within the folds of his dress;
and, rising from his kneeling posture upon the body, he stood by its side,
with folded arms, gazing upon it, for some minutes, in silence, heedless of
the still advancing water, which was already considerably above his feet.

     Then he spoke in his ordinary accents, and evidently caring nothing for
the fact that he had done such a deed.

     "I must dispose of this carcase," he said, "which now seems so 
lifeless,
for the moon is up, and if its beams fall upon it, I know, from former
experience, what will happen; it will rise again, and walk the earth, 
seeking
for vengeance upon me, and the thirst for that vengeance upon me, and the
thirst for that vengeance will become such a part of its very nature, that 
it
will surely accomplish something, if not all that it desires."

     After a few momemts' consideration, he stooped, and, with more strength
than one would have thought it possible a man reduced almost, as he was, to 
a
skeleton could have exerted, he lifted the body, and carried it rapidly up 
the
beach towards the cliffs.  He threw it down upon the stone steps that led to
the small door of the excavation in the cliff, and it fell upon them with a
sickening sound, as if some of the bones were surely broken by the fall.

     The object, then, of the baron seemed to be to get this door open, if 
he
possibly could; but that was an object easier to be desired than carried 
into
effect, for, although he exerted his utmost power, he did not succeed in
moving it an inch, and he began evidently to think that it would be 
impossible
to do so.

     But yet he did not give up the attempt at once, but looking about upon
the beach, until he found a large heavy stone, he raised it in his arms, 
and,
approaching the door, he flung it against it with such tremendous force, 
that
it flew open instantly, disclosing within a dark and narrow passage.

     Apparently rejoiced that he had accomplished this much, he stepped
cautiously within the entrance, and then, taking from a concealed pocket 
that
was in the velvet cloak which he wore a little box, he produced from it some
wax-lights and some chemical matches, which, by the slightest effort, he
succeeded in igniting, and then, with one of the lights in his hand to guide
him on his way, he went on exploring the passage, and treading with extreme
caution as he went, for fear of falling into any of the ice-wells which were
reported to be in that place.

     After proceeding about twenty yards, and finding that there was no
danger, he became less cautious; but, in consequence of such less caution, 
he
very nearly sacrificed his life, for he came upon an ice-well which seemed a
considerable depth, and into which he had nearly plunged headlong.

     He started back with some degree of horror; but that soon left him, and
then, after a moment's thought, he sought for some little nook in the wall, 
in
which he might place the candle, and soon finding one that answered the
purpose well, he there left it, having all the appearance of a little 
shrine,
while he proceeded again to the mouth of that singular and cavernous-looking
place.  He had, evidently, quite made up his mind what to do, for, without a
moment's hesitation, he lifted the body again, and carried it within the
entrance, walking boldly and firmly, now that he knew there was no danger
between him and the light, which shed a gleam through the darkness of the
place of a very faint and flickering character.

     He reached it rapidly, and when he got to the side of the well, he,
without a moment's hesitation, flung it headlong down, and, listening
attentively, he heard it fall with a slight plash, as if there was some 
water
at the bottom of the pit.

     It was an annoyance, however, for him to find that the distance was not
so deep as he had anticipated, and when he took the light from the niche 
where
he had placed it, and looked earnestly down, he could see the livid,
ghastly-looking face of the dead man, for the body had accidentally fallen
upon its back, which was a circumstance he had not counted upon, and one 
which
increased the chances greatly of its being seen, should any one be 
exploring,
from curiosity, that not very inviting place.

     This was annoyance, but how could it be prevented, unless, indeed, he
chose to descend, and make an alteration in the disposition of the corpse? 
But this was evidently what he did not choose to do; so, after muttering to
himself a few words expressive of his intention to leave it where it was, he
replaced the candle, after extinguishing it, in the box from whence he had
taken it, and carefully walked out of the dismal place.

     The moonbeams were shining very brightly and beautifully upon the face 
of
the cliffs, when he emerged from the subterranean passage, so that he could
see the door, the steps, and every object quite distinctly; and, to his
gratification, he found that he had not destroyed any fastening that was to
the door, but that when it was slammed shut, it struck so hard and fast, 
that
the strength of one man could not possibly move it, even the smallest 
fraction
of an inch.

     "I shall be shown all this to-morrow," he said; "and if I take this 
house
I must have an alteration made in this door, so that it may open with a 
lock,
instead of by main violence, as at present; but if, in the morning, when I
view Anderbury House, I can avoid an entrance into this region, I will do 
so,
and at my leisure, if I become the possessor of the estate, I can explore
every nook and cranny of it.

     He then folded his cloak about him, after pulling the door as closely 
as
he could.  He walked slowly and thoughtfully back to the inn.  It was quite
evident that the idea of the murder he had committed did not annoy him in 
the
least, and that in his speculations upon the subject he congratulated 
himself
much upon having so far succeeded in getting rid of certainly a most
troublesome acquaintance.

     "'Tis well, indeed," he said, "that just at this juncture he should 
throw
himself in my way, and enable me so easy to feel certain that I shall never
more be troubled with him.  Truly, I ran some risk, and when my pistol 
missed
fire, it seemed as if my evil star was in its ascendant, and that I was 
doomed
myself to become the victim of him whom I have laid in so cold a grave.  But
I have been victorious, and I am willing to accept the circumstance as an
omen of the past-- that my fortunes are on the change.  I think I shall be
successful now, and with the ample means which I now possess, surely, in 
this
country, where gold is loved so well, I shall be able to overcome all
difficulties, and to unite myself to some one, who-- but no matter, her fate
is an after consideration."

 Next Time: The Marriage in the Bannerworth Family Arranged.




                                Chapter XCV.

THE MARRIAGE IN THE BANNERWORTH FAMILY ARRANGED.


     After the adventure of the doctor with regard to the picture about 
which
such an air of mystery and interest has been thrown, the Bannerworth family
began to give up all hopes of ever finding a clue to those circumstances
concerning which they would certainly have liked to have known the truth, 
but
of which it was not likely they would ever hear anything more.

     Dr. Chillingowrth now had no reserve, and when he had recovered
sufficiently to feel that he could converse without an effort, he took an
opportunity, while the whole of the family were present, to speak of what 
had
been his hopes and his expectations.

     "You are all aware," he said, "now, of the story of Marmaduke
Bannerworth, and what an excessively troublesome person he was, with all
deference, to you, Henry; first of all, as to spending all his money at the
gaming-table, and leaving his family destitute; and then, when he did get a
lump of money which might have done some good to those he left behind him--
hiding it somewhere where it could not be found at all, and so leaving you 
all
in great difficulty and distress, when you might have been independent."

     "That's true enough, doctor," said Henry; "but you know the old 
proverb,
-- that ill-gotten wealth never thrives; so that I don't regret not finding
this money, for I am sure we should have been none the happier with it, and
perhaps not so happy."

     "Oh, bother the old proverb; thirty or forty thousand pounds is no 
trifle
to be talked lightly of, or the loss of which to be quietly put up with, on
account of a musty proverb.  It's a large sum, and I should like to have
placed it in your hands."

     "But as you cannot, doctor, there can be no good possibly done by
regretting it."

     "No, certainly; I don't mean that; utter regret is always a very 
foolish
thing; but it's questionable whether something might not be done in the
matter, after all, for you, as it appears, by all the evidence we can 
collect,
that it must have been Varney, after all, who jumped down upon me from the
garden-wall in so sudden a manner; and, if the picture be valuable to him, 
it
must be valuable to us."

     "But how are we to get it, and, if we could, I do not see that it would
be of much value to anybody, for, after all, it is but a painting."

     "There you go again," said the doctor, "depreciating what you know
nothing about; now, listen to me, Master Henry, and I will tell you.  That
picture evidently had some sort of lining at the back, over the original
canvas; and do you think I would have taken such pains to bring it away with
me if that lining had not made me suspect that between it and the original
picture the money, in bank notes, was deposited?"

     "Had you any special reason for supposing such was the case?"

     "Yes; most unquestionably I had; for when I got the picture fairly 
down,
I found various inequalities in the surface of the back, which led me to
believe that rolls of notes were deposited, and that the great mistake we 
had
all along made was in looking behind the picture, instead of at the picture
itself.  I meant immediately to have cut it to pieces when I reached here 
with
it; but now it has got into the hands of somebody else, who knows, I 
suspect,
as much I do."

     "It is rather provoking."

     "Rather provoking! is that the way to talk of the loss of Heaven knows
how many thousands of pounds!  I am quite aggravated myself at the idea of 
the
thing, and it puts me in a perfect fever to think of it, I can assure you."

     "But what can we do?"

     "Oh!  I propose an immediate crusade against Varney, the vampyre, for 
who
but he could have made such an attack upon me, and force me to deliver up 
such
a valuable treasure?"

     "Never heed it, doctor," said Flora; "let it go; we have never had or
enjoyed that money, so it cannot matter, and it is not to be considered as 
the
loss of an actual possession, because we never did actually possess it."

     "Yes," chimed in the admiral; "bother the money! what do we care about
it; and, besides, Charley Holland is going to be very busy."

     "Busy!" said the doctor; "how do you mean?"

     "Why, isn't he going to be married directly to Flora, here, and am not 
I
going to settle the whole of my property upon him on condition that he takes
the name of Bell instead of Holland? for, you see, his mother was my sister,
and of course her name was Bell.  As for his father Holland, it can't matter
to him now what Charley is called; and if he don't take the name of Bell I
shall be the last in the family, for I am not likely to marry, and have any
little Bells about me."

     "No," said the doctor; "I should say not; and that's the reason why you
want to ring the changes upon Charles Holland's name.  Do you see the joke,
admiral?"

     "I can't say I do-- where is it?  It's all very well to talk of jokes,
but if I was like Charles, going to be married, I shouldn't be in any joking
humour, I can tell you, but quite the reverse; and as for you and your
picture, if you want it, doctor, just run after Varney yourself for it; or,
stay-- I have a better idea than that-- get your wife to go and ask him for
it, and if she makes half such a clamour about his ears that she did about
ours, he will give it her in a minute, to get rid of her."

     "My wife! -- you don't mean to say she has been here?"

     "Yes, but she has though.  And now, doctor, I can tell you I have seen 
a
good deal of service in all parts of the world, and, of course, picked up a
little experience; and, if I were you, some of these days, when Mrs.
Chillingworth ain't very well, I'd give her a composing draught that would
make her quiet enough."

     "Ah! that's not my style of practice, admiral; but I am sorry to hear
that Mrs. Chillingworth has annoyed you so much."

     "Pho, pho, man! -- pho, pho! do you think she could annoy me?  Why, I
have encountered storms and squalls in all latitudes, and it isn't a woman's
tongue now that can do anything of an annoying character I can tell you; far
from it-- very far from it; so don't distress yourself upon that head.  But
come, doctor, we are going to have the wedding the day after to-morrow."

     "No, no," said Flora; "the week after next, you mean."

     "Is it the week after next?  I'll be hanged if I didn't think it was 
the
day after tomorrow; but of course you know best, as you have settled it all
among you.  I have nothing to do with it."

     "Of course, I shall, with great pleasure," returned the doctor, "be
present on the interesting occasion; but do you intend taking possession of
Bannerworth Hall again?"

     "No, certainly not," said Henry; "we propose going to the Dearbrook
estate, and there remaining for a time to see how we all like it.  We may,
perchance, enjoy it very much, for I have heard it spoken of as an 
attractive
little property enough, and one that any one might fancy, after being
resident a short time upon it."

     "Well," said the admiral; "that is, I believe, settled among us, but I 
am
sure we sha'n't like it, on account of the want of the sea.  Why, I tell 
you,
I have not seen a ship myself for this eighteen months; there's a state of
things, you see, that won't do to last, because one would get dry-mouldy; 
it's
a shocking thing to see nothing but land, land, wherever you go."

     From the preceding conversation may be gathered what were the designs 
of
the Bannerworth family, and what progress had been made in carrying them 
out. 
From the moment they had discovered the title-deeds of the Dearbrook 
property,
they had ceased to care about the large sum of money which Marmaduke
Bannerworth had been supposed to have hidden in some portion of Bannerworth
Hall.

     They had already passed through quite enough of the busy turmoils of
existence to be grateful for anything that promised ease and competence, and
that serenity of mind which is the dearest possession which any one can
compass.

     Consequently was it, that, with one accord, they got rid of all 
yearning
after the large sum which the doctor was so anxious to procure for them, and
looked forward to a life of great happiness and contentment.  On the whole,
too, when they came to talk the matter over quietly among themselves, they
were not sorry that Varney had taken himself off in the way he had, for 
really
it was a great release; and, as he had couched his farewell in words which
signified it was a final one, they were inclined to think that he must have
left England, and that it was not likely they should ever again encounter 
him,
under any circumstances whatever.

     It was to be considered quite as a whim of the old admiral's, the
changing of Charles Holland's name to Bell; but, as Charles himself said 
when
the subject was broached to him, -- "I am so well content to be called
whatever those to whom I feel affection think proper, that I give up my name
of Holland without a pang, willingly adopting in its stead one that has 
always
been hallowed in my remembrance with the best and kindest recollections."

     And thus this affair was settled, much to the satisfaction of Flora, 
who
was quite as well content to be called Mrs. Bell as to be called Mrs. 
Holland,
since the object of her attachment remained the same.  The wedding was 
really
fixed for the week after that which followed the conversation we have
recorded; but the admiral was not at all disposed to allow Flora and his
nephew Charles to get through such an important period of their lives 
without
some greater demonstration and show than could be made from the little 
cottage
where they dwelt; and consequently he wished that they should leave that and
proceed at once to a larger mansion, which he had his eye upon a few miles
off, and which was to be had furnished for a time, at the pleasure of any 
one.

     "And we won't shut ourselves up," said the admiral; "but we will find 
out
all the Christian-like people in the neighbourhood, and invite them to the
wedding, and we will have a jolly good breakfast together, and lots of 
music,
and a famous lunch; and, after that, a dinner, and then a dance, and all 
that
sort of thing; so that there shall be no want of fun."

     As may be well supposed, both Charles and Flora shrunk from so public 
an
affair; but, as the old man had evidently set his heart upon it, they did 
not
like to say they positively would not; so, after a vain attempt to dissuade
him from removing at all from the cottage until they removed for good, they
gave up the point to him, and he had it all his own way.

     He took the house, for one month, which had so taken his fancy, and
certainly a pretty enough place it was, although they found out afterwards,
that why it was he was so charmed with it consisted in the fact that it bore
the name of a vessel which he had once commanded; but this they did not know
until a long time afterwards, when it slipped out by mere accident.

     They stipulated with the admiral that there should not be more than
twenty guests at the breakfast which was to succeed the marriage ceremony; 
and
to that he acceded; but Henry whispered to Charles Holland, --

     "I know this public wedding to be distasteful to you, and most
particularly do I know it is distasteful to Flora; so, if you do not mind
playing a trick upon the old man, I can very easily put you in the way of
cheating him entirely."

     "Indeed; I should like to hear, and, what is more, I should like to
practise, if you think it will not so entirely offend him as to make him
implacable."

     "Not at all, not at all; he will laugh himself, when he comes to know 
it,
as much as any of us; the present difficulty will be to procure Flora's
connivance; but that we must do the best way we can by persuasion."

     What this scheme was will ultimately appear; but, certain it is, that 
the
old admiral had no suspicion of what was going on and proceeded to make all
his arrangements accordingly.

     From his first arrival in the market town -- in the neighbourhood of
which was Bannerworth Hall -- it will be recollected that he had taken a 
great
fancy to the lawyer, in whose name a forged letter had been sent him,
informing him of the fact that his nephew, Charles Holland, intended 
marrying
into a family of vampyres.

     It was this letter, as the reader is aware, which brought the old 
admiral
and Jack Pringle into the neighbourhood of the Hall; and, although it was a
manoeuvre to get rid of Charles Holland, which failed most signally, there
can be no doubt but that such a letter was the production of Sir Francis
Varney, and that he wrote it for the express purpose of getting rid of 
Charles
from the Hall, who had begun materially to interfere with his plans and
projects there.

     After some conversaton with himself, the admiral thought that this 
lawyer
would be just the man to recommend the proper sort of people to be invited 
to
the wedding of Charles and Flora; so he wrote to him, inviting himself to
dinner, and received back a very gracious reply from the lawyer, who 
declared
that the honour of entertaining a gentleman whom he so much respected as
Admiral Bell, was greater than he had a right to expect by a great deal, and
that he should feel most grateful for his company, and await his coming with
the greatest impatience.

     "A devilish civil fellow, that attorney," said the admiral, as he put 
the
letter in his pocket, "and almost enough to put one in conceit of lawyers."

     "Yes," said Jack Pringle, who had overheard the admiral read the 
letter. 
"Yes, we will honour him; and I only hope he will have plenty of grog;
because, you see, if he don't- -- D--n it! what's that!  Can't you keep 
things
to yourself?"

     This latter exclamation arose from the fact that the admiral was so
indignant at Jack for listening to what he had been saying, as to throw a
leaden inkstand, that happened to be upon the table, at his head.

     "You mutinous swab!" he said, "cannot a gentleman ask me to dinner, or
cannot I ask myself, without you putting your spoke in the windlass, you
vagabond?"

     "Oh! well," said Jack, "if you are out of temper about it, I had better
send my mark to the lawyer, and tell him that we won't come, as it has made
some family differences."

     "Family, you thief!" said the admiral.  "What do you mean?  What family
do you think would own you?  D--n me, if I don't think you came over in some
strange ship.  But, I tell you what it is, if you interfere in this matter,
I'll be hanged if I don't blow your brains out."

     "And you'll be hanged if you do," said Jack, as he walked out of the
room; "so it's all one either way, old fizgig."

     "What!" roared the admiral, as he sprang up and ran after Jack.  "Have 
I
lived all these years to be called names in my own ship-- I mean my own 
house? 
What does the infernal rascal mean by it?"

     The admiral, no doubt, would have pursued Jack very closely, had not
Flora intercepted him, and, by gentle violence, got him back to the room.  
No
one else could have ventured to have stopped him, but the affection he had 
for
her was so great that she could really accomplish almost anything with him;
and, by listening quietly to his complaints of Jack Pringle-- which, 
however,
involved a disclosure of the fact which he had intended to keep to himself,
that he had sought the lawyer's advice-- she succeeded in soothing him
completely, so that he forgot his anger in a very short time.

     But the old man's anger, although easily aroused, never lasted very 
long;
and, upon the whole, it was really astonishing what he put up with from Jack
Pringle, in the way of taunts and sneers, of all sorts and descriptions, and
now and then not a little real abuse.

     And, probably, he thought likewise that Jack Pringle did not mean what 
he
said, on the same prnciple that he (the admiral), when he called Jack a
mutinous swab and a marine, certainly did not mean that Jack was those 
things,
but merely used them as expletives to express a great amount of indignation 
at
the moment, because, as may be well supposed, nothing in the world could be
worse, in Admiral Bell's estimation, that to be a mutinous swab or a marine.

     It was rather a wonder, though, that, in his anger some day, he did not
do Jack some mischief; for, as we have had occasion to notice in one or two
cases, the admiral was not extremely particular as to what sorts of missiles
he used when he considered it necessary to throw something at Jack's head.

     It would not have been a surprising thing if Jack had really made some
communication to the lawyer; but he did stop short at that amount of
pleasantry, and, as he himself expressed it, for once in a way he let the 
old
man please himself.

     The admiral soon forgot this little dispute, and then pleased himself
with the idea that he should pass a pleasant day with the attorney.

     "Ah! well," he said; "who would have thought that ever I should have 
gone
and taken dinner with a lawyer-- and not only done that, but invited myself
too!  It shows us all that there may be some good in all sorts of men, 
lawyers
included; and I am sure, after this, I ought to begin to think what I never
thought before, and that is, that a marine may actually be a useful person. 
It shows that, as one gets older, one gets wiser."

     It was an immense piece of liberality for a man brought up, as Admiral
Bell had been, in decidedly one of the most prejudiced branches of the 
public
service, to make any such admissions as these.  A very great thing it was, 
and
showed a liberality of mind such as, even at the present time, is not 
readily
found.

     It is astonishing, as well as amusing, to find how the mind assimilates
itself to the circumstances in which it is placed, and how society, being 
cut
up into small sections, imagines different things merely as a consequence of
their peculiar application.  We shall find that even people, living at
different ends of a city, will look with a sort of pity and contempt upon 
each
other; and it is much to be regretted that public writers are found who use
what little ability they may possess in pandering to their feelings.

     It was as contemptible and silly as it was reprehensible for a late
celebrated novelist to pretend that he believed there was a place called
Bloomsbury-square, but he really did not know; because that was merely done
for the purpose of raising a silly laugh among persons who were neither
respectable on account of their abilities or their conduct.

     But to return from this digression.  The admiral, attired in his best
suit, which always consisted of a blue coat, the exact colour of the navy
uniform, an immense pale primrose coloured waistcoat, and white kerseymere
continuations, went to the lawyer's as had been arranged.

     If anything at all could flatter the old man's vanity successfully, it
certainly would be the manner in which he was received at the lawyer's 
house,
where everything was done that could give him satisfaction.

     A very handsome repast was laid before him, and, when the cloth was
removed, the admiral broached the subject upon which he wished to ask the
advice of his professional friend.  After telling him of the wedding that 
was
to come off, he said, --

     "Now, I have bargained to invite twenty people; and, of course, as that
is exclusive of any of the family, and as I don't know any people about this
neighbourhood except yourself, I want you and your family to come to start
with, and then I want you to find me out some more decent people to make up
the party."

     "I feel highly flattered," said the attorney, "that, in such a case as
this, you should have come to me, and my only great fear is, that I should 
not
be able to give you satisfaction."

     "Oh! you needn't be afraid of that; there is no fear on that head; so I
shall leave it all to you to invite the folks that you think proper."

     "I will endeavour, certainly, admiral, to do my best.  Of course, 
living
in the town, as I have for many years, I know some very nice people as well 
as
some very queer ones."

     "Oh! we don't want any of the queer ones; but let those who are invited
be frank, hearty, good-tempered people, such as one will be glad to meet 
over
and over again without any ceremony-- none of your simpering people, who are
afraid to laugh for fear of opening their mouths too wide, but who are so
mightly genteel that they are afraid to enjoy anything for fear it should be
vulgar."

     "I understand you, admiral, perfectly, and shall endeavour to obey your
instructions to the very letter; but, if I should unfortunately invite 
anybody
you don't like, you must excuse me for making such a mistake,"

     "Oh, of course-- of course.  Never mind that; and if any disagreeable
fellow comes, we will smother him in some way."

     "It would serve him right, for no one ought to make himself 
diagreeable,
after being honoured with an invitation from you; but I will be most
especially careful, and I hope that such a circumstance will not occur."

     "Never mind. If it should, I'll tell you what I'll do; I'll set Jack
Pringle upon him, and if he don't worry his life out it will be a strange
thing to me."

     "Oh," said the lawyer, "I am glad you have mentioned him, for it gives 
me
an opportunity of saying that I have done all in my power to make him
comfortable."

     "All in your power to make him comfortable!  What do you mean?"

     "I mean that I have placed such a dinner before him as will please him; 
I
told him to ask for just whatever he likes."

     The admiral looked at the lawyer with amazement, for a few moments, in
silence, and then he said,

     "D--n it! why, you don't mean to tell me, that that rascal is here."

     "Oh yes; he came about ten minutes before you arrived, and said you 
were
coming, and he has been down stairs feasting all the while since."

     "Stop a bit.  Do you happen to have any loaded fire arms in the house?"

     "We have got an old blunderbuss; but what for, admiral?"

     "To shoot that scoundrel, Pringle.  I'll blow his brains out, as sure 
as
fate.  The impudence of his coming here, directly against my orders, too."

     "My dear sir, calm yourself, and think nothing of it; it's of no
consequence whatever."

     "No consequence; where is that blunderbuss of yours?  Do you mean to 
tell
me that mutiny is of no consequence?  Give me the blunderbuss."

     "But, my dear sir, we only keep it _in terrorem_, and have no bullets."

     "Never mind that, we can cram in a handful of nails, or brass buttons, 
or
hammer up a few halfpence-- anything of that sort will do to settle his
business with."

     "How do you get on, old Tarbarrel?" said Jack, putting his head in at 
the
door.  "Are you making yourself comfortable?  I'll be hanged if I don't 
think
you have a drop too much already, you look so precious red about the gills.  
I
have been getting on famous, and I thought I'd just hop up for a minute to
make your mind easy about me, and tell you so."

     It was quite evident that Jack had done justice to the good cheer of 
the
lawyer, for he was rather unsteady, and had to hold by the door-post to
support himself, while there was such a look of contentment upon his
countenance as contrasted with the indignation that was manifest upon the
admiral's face, that, as the saying is, it would have made a cat laugh to 
see
them.

     "Be off with ye, Jack," said the lawyer; "be off with ye.  Go down 
stairs
again and enjoy yourself.  Don't you see that the admiral is angry with 
you."

     "Oh, he be bothered," said Jack; "I'll soon settle him if he comes any 
of
his nonsense; and mind, Mr. Lawyer, whatever you do, don't you give him too
much to drink."

     The lawyer ran to the door, and pushed Jack out, for he rightly enough
suspected that the quietness of the admiral was only that calm which 
precedes
a storm of more than usual amount and magnitude, so he was anxious to part
them at once.

     He then set about appeasing, as well as he could, the admiral's anger, 
by
attributing the perseverance of Jack, in following him wherever he went, to
his great affection for him, which, combined with his ignorance, might make
him often troublesome when he had really no intention of being so.

     This was certainly the best way of appeasing the old man; and, indeed,
the only way in which it could be done successfully, and the proof that it 
was
so, consisted in the fact, that the admiral did consent, at the suggestion 
of
the attorney, to forgive Jack once more for the offence he had committed.

 Next Time: The Baron Takes Anderbury House, and Decides Upon Giving a Grand
 Entertainment.




                                Chapter XCVI.

THE BARON TAKES ANDERBURY HOUSE, AND DECIDES UPON GIVING A GRAND
ENTERTAINMENT.


     It was not considered anything extraordinary that, although the Baron
Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh went out with the mysterious stranger who had 
arrived
at the Anderbury Arms to see him, he should return without him, for 
certainly
he was not bound to bring him back, by any means whatever.

     Moreover, he entered the inn so quietly, and with such an appearance of
perfect composure, that no one could have suspected for a moment that he had
been guilty really of the terrific crime which had been laid to his charge -
-
a crime which few men could have committed in so entirely unmoved and
passionless a manner as he had done it.

     But he seemed to consider the taking of a human life as a thing not of
the remotest consequence, and not to be considered at all as a matter which
was to put any one out of the way, but as a thing to be done when necessity
required, with all the ease in the world, without arousing or awaking any of
those feelings of remorse which one would suppose ought to find a place in 
the
heart of a man who had been guilty of such monstrous behaviour.

     He walked up to his own apartment again, and retired to rest with the
same feeling, apparently, of calmness, and the same ability to taste of the
sweets of repose as had before characterized him.

     The stranger's horse, which was a valuable and beautiful animal, 
remained
in the stable of the inn, and as, of course, that was considered a guarantee
for his return, the landlord, when he himself retired to rest, left one of 
his
establishment sitting up to let in the man who now lay so motionless and so
frightful in appearance in one of the ice-wells of the mysterious passage
leading from the base of the cliffs to the grounds of Anderbury House.

     But the night wore on, and the man who had been left to let the 
stranger
in, after making many efforts to keep himself awake, dropped into sound
repose, which he might just as well have done in the first instance, 
inasmuch
as, although he knew it not, he was engaged in the vain task of waiting for
the dead.

     The morning was fresh and beautiful, and, at a far earlier hour than a
person of his quality was expected to make his appearance, the baron 
descended
from his chamber; for, somehow or other, by common consent, it seems to be
agreed that great personages must be late in rising, and equally late in 
going
to bed.

     But the baron was evidently not so disposed to turn night into day, and
the landlord congratulated himself not a little upon the fact that he was
ready for his illustrious guest when he descended so unexpectedly from his
chamber as he did.

     An ample breakfast was disposed of; that is to say, it was placed upon
the table, and charged to the baron, who selected from it what he pleased; 
and
when the meal was over the landlord ventured to enter the apartment, and 
said
to him, with all due humility, --

     "If you please, sir, Mr. Leek, who has the letting of Anderbury-on-the-
Mount, that is, Anderbury House, as it is usually called, is here, sir, and
would be happy to take your orders as to when you would be pleased to look 
at
those premises?"

     "I shall be ready to go in half an hour," said the baron; "and, as the
distance is not great, I will walk from here to the mansion."

     This message was duly communicated to Mr. Leek, who thereupon 
determined
upon waiting until the baron should announce his readiness to depart upon 
the
expedition; and he was as good as his word, for, in about half-an-hour
afterwards, he descended to the hall, and then Mr. Leek was summoned, who 
came
out of the bar with such a grand rush, that he fell over a mat that was 
before
him, and saluted the baron by digging his head into his stomach, and then
falling sprawling at his feet, and laying hold of his ancle.

     This little incident was duly apologised for, and explained; after 
which
Mr. Leek walked on through the town, towards Anderbury-on-the-Mount, 
followed
by the illustrious personage whom he sincerely hoped he should be able to
induce to take it.

     It was a curious thing to see how they traversed the streets together;
for while the baron walked right on, and with a solemn and measured step, 
Mr.
Leek managed to get along a few paces in front of him, sideways, so that he
could keep up a sort of conversation upon the merits of Anderbury House, and
the neighbourhood in general, without much effort; to which remarks the 
baron
made such suitable and dignified replies as a baron would be supposed to 
make.

     "You will find, sir," said Mr. Leek, "that everything about Anderbury 
is
extremely select, and amazingly correct; and I am sure a more delightful 
place
to live in could not be found."

     "Ah!" said the baron; "very likely."

     "It's lively, too," continued Mr. Leek; very likely; and there are two
chapels of ease, besides the church."

     "That's a drawback," said the baron.

     "A drawback, sir! well, I am sorry I mentioned it; but perhaps you are 
a
Roman Catholic, sir, and, in that case, the chapels of ease have no interest
for you."

     "Not the slightest; but do not, sir, run away with any assumption
concerning my religious opinions, for I am not a Roman Catholic."

     "No, sir, no, sir; nor more am I; and, as far as I think, and my 
opinion
goes, I say, why shouldn't a gentleman with a large fortune be what he 
likes,
or nothing, if he likes that better? but here we are, sir, close to one of 
the
entrances of Anderbury House.  There are three principal entrances, you
understand, sir, on three sides of the estate, and the fourth side faces the
sea, where there is that mysterious passage that leads down from the grounds
to the beach, which, perhaps, you have heard of, sir."

     "The landlord of the inn mentioned it."

     "We consider it a great curiosity, sir, I can assure you, in these
parts-- a very great curiosity; and it's an immense advantage to the house,
because, you see, sir, in extremely hot weather, all sorts of provisions can
be taken down there, and kept at such a very low temperature as to be quite
delightful."

     "That is an advantage."

     Mr. Leek rang the bell that hung over one of the entrances, and his
summons for admission was speedily answered by the old couple who had charge
of the premises, and then, with a view of impressing them with a notion of 
the
importance of the personage whom he had brought to look at the place, he 
said,
aloud,--

     "The Baron Stoltmayor, of Saltsomething, has come to look at the
premises."

     This announcement was received with all due deference and respect, and
the task of showing the baron the premises at once fairly commenced.

     "Here you have," said Mr. Leek, assuming an oratorical attitude-- "here
you have the umbrageous trees stooping down to dip their leaves in the 
purling
waters; here you have the sweet foliage lending a delicious perfume to the
balmy air; here you have the murmuring waterfalls playing music of the 
spheres
to the listening birds, who sit responsive upon the dancing boughs; here you
have all the fragrance of the briny ocean, mingling with the scent of a bank
of violets, and wrapping the senses in Elysium; here you may never tire of 
an
existence that presents never-ending charms, and that, in the full enjoyment
of which, you may live far beyond the allotted span of man."

     "Enough-- enough, said the baron.

     "Here you have the choicest exotics taking kindly to a soil gifted by
nature with the most extraordinary powers of production; and all that can
pamper the appetite, or yield delight to the senses, is scattered around by
nature with a liberal hand.  It is quite impossible that royalty should come
near the favoured spot without visting it as a thing of course; and I forgot
to mention that a revenue is derived from some cottages, which, although
small, is yet sufficient to pay the tithe on the whole estate."

     "There, there-- that will do."

     "Here you have purling rills and cascades, and fish-ponds so redundant
with the finny tribe, that you have but to wish for sport, and it is yours;
here you have in the mansion, chambers that vie with the accomodation of a
palace-- ample dormitories and halls of ancient grandeur; here you have ---"

     "Stop," said the baron, "stop; I cannot be pestered in this way with 
your
description.  I have no patience to listen to such mere words-- show me the
house at once, and let me judge for myself."

     "Certainly, sir; oh! certainly; only I thought it right to give you a
slight description of the place as it really was; and now, sir, that we have
reached the house, I may remark that here we have ---"

     "Silence!" said the baron; "if you begin with here we have, I know not
when you will leave off.  All I require of you is to show me the place, and 
to
answer any question which I may put to you concerning it.  I will draw my 
own
conclusions, and nothing you can say, one way or another, will affect my
imagination."

     "Certainly, sir, certainly; I shall only be too happy to answer any
questions that may be put to me by a person of your lordship's great
intelligence; and all I can remark is, that when you reach the drawing-room
floor, any person may truly say, here you have-- I really beg your pardon,
sir-- I had not the slightest intention of saying here you have, I assure 
you;
but the words came out quite unawares, I assure you."

     "Peace-- peace!" cried again the baron; "you disturb me by this 
incessant
clatter."

     Thus admonished, Mr. Leek was now quiet, and allowed the baron in his 
own
way to make what investigation he pleased concerning Anderbury House."

     The investigation was not one that could be gone over in ten minutes; 
for
the house was extremely extensive, and the estate altogether presented so 
many
features of beauty and interest, that it was impossible not to linger over 
it
for a considerable period of time.

     The grounds were most extensive, and planted with such a regard to 
order
and regularity, everything being in its proper place, that it was a pleasure
to see an estate so well kept.  And although the baron was not a man who 
said
much, it was quite evident, by what little he did utter, that he was very 
well pleased with Anderbury-on-the-Mount.

     "And now," said Mr. Leek, "I will do myself the pleasure, sir, of 
showing
your grace the subterranean passage."

     At this moment a loud ring at one of the entrance gates was heard, and
upon the man who had charge of the house answering the summons for 
admission,
he found that it was a gentleman, who gave a card on which was the name of 
Sir
John Westlake, and who desired to see the premises.

     "Sir John Westlake," said Mr. Leek; "oh! I recollect he did call at my
office, and say that he thought of taking Anderbury-on-the-Mount.  A 
gentleman
of great wealth and taste is Sir John, but I must tell him, baron, that you
have the preference if you choose to embrace it."

     At this moment the stranger advanced, and when he saw the baron, he 
bowed
courteously, upon which Mr. Leek said, --

     "I regret, Sir John, that if you should take a fancy to the place, I am
compelled first of all to give this gentleman the refusal of it."

     "Certainly," said Sir John Westlake; "do not let me interfere with any
one.  I have nearly made up my mind, and came to look over the property 
again;
but of course, if this gentleman is beforehand with me, I must be content.  
I
wish particularly to go down to the subterranean passage to the beach, if it
is not too much trouble."

     "Trouble! certainly not, sir.  Here, Davis, get some links, and we can 
go
at once; and as this gentleman likewise has seen everything but that strange
excavation, he will probably descend with us."

     "Certainly," said the baron; "I shall have great pleasure;" and he said
it with so free and unembarrassed an air, that no one could have believed 
for
a moment in the possibility that such a subject of fearful interest to him 
was
there to be found.

     The entrance from the grounds into this deep cavernous place was in a
small but neat building, that looked like a summer-house; and now, torches
being procured, and one lit, a door was opened, which conducted at once into
the commencement of the excavation; and Mr. Leek heading the way, the
distinguished party, as that gentleman loved afterwards to call it in his
accounts of the transaction, proceeded into the very bowels of the earth, as
it were, and quickly lost all traces of the daylight.

     The place did not descend by steps, but by a gentle slope, which it
required some caution to traverse, because, being cut in the chalk, which in
some places was worn very smooth, it was extremely slipperly; but this was a
difficulty that a little practice soon overcame, and as they went on the 
place
became more interesting every minute.

     Even the baron allowed Mr. Leek to make a speech upon the occasion, and
that gentleman said, --

     "You will perceive that this excavation must have been made, at a great
expense, out of the solid cliff, and in making it some of the most curious
specimens of petrifaction and fossil remains were found.  You see that the
roof is vaulted, and that it is only now and then a lump of chalk has fallen
in, or a great piece of flint; and now we come to one of the ice-wells."

     The came to a deep excavation, down which they looked, and when the man
held the torch beneath its surface, they could dimly see the bottom of it,
where there was a number of large pieces of flint stone, and, apparently,
likewise, the remains of broken bottles.

     "There used to be a windlass at the top of this," said Mr. Leek, "and 
the
things were let down in a basket.  They do say that ice will keep for two
years in one of these places."

     "And are there more of these excavations?" said the baron.

     "Oh, dear, yes, sir; there are five or six of them for different
purposes; for when the family that used to live in Anderbury House had grand
entertainments, which they sometimes had in the summer season, they always 
had
a lot of men down here, cooling wines, and passing them up from hand to hand
to the house."

     From the gradual slope of this passage down to the cliffs, and the 
zigzag
character of it, it may be well supposed that it was of considerable extent. 
Indeed, Mr. Leek asserted that it was half a mile in actual measured length.

     The baron was not at all anxious to run any risk of a discovery of the
dead body which he had cast into that ice-well which was nearest to the
opening on to the beach, so, as he went on, he negatived the different
proposals that were made to look down into the excavations, and succeeded in
putting a stop to that species of inquiry in the majority of instances, but 
he
could not wholly do so.

     Perhaps it would have been better for his purpose if he had encouraged 
a
look into every one of the ice-wells; for, in that case, their similarity of
appearance might have tired out Sir John Westlake before they got to the 
last
one; but as it was, when they reached the one down which the body had been
precipitated, he had the mortification to hear Mr. Leek say, --

     "And now, Sir John, and you, my lord baron, as we have looked at the
first of these ice wells and at none of the others, suppose we look at the
last."

     The baron was afraid to say anything; because, if the body were
discovered, and identified as that of the visitor at the inn, and who had 
been
seen last with him, any reluctance on his part to have that ice-well 
examined,
might easily afterwards be construed into a very powerful piece of
circumstantial evidence against him.

     He therefore merely bowed his assent, thinking that the examination 
would
be but a superficial one, and that, in consequence, he should escape easily
from any disagreeable consequences.

     But this the fates ordained otherwise; and there seemed no hope of that
ice-well in particular escaping such an investigation as was sure to induce
some uncomfortable results.

     "Davis," said Mr. Leek, "these places are not deep, you see, and I was
thinking that if you went down one of them, it would be as well; for then 
you
would be able to tell the gentlemen what the bottom was fairly composed of,
you understand."

     "Oh, I don't mind, sir," said Davis.  "I have been down one of them
before today, I can tell you, sir."

     "I do not see the necessity," said Sir John Westlake, "exactly, of such 
a
thing; but still if you please, and this gentleman wishes ---"

     "I have no wish upon the occasion," said the baron; "and, like 
yourself,
cannot see the necessity."

     "Oh, there is no trouble," said Mr. Leek; "and it's better, now you are
here, that you see and understand all about it.  How can you get down, 
Davis?"

     "Why, sir, it ain't above fourteen feet altogether; so I sha'n't have 
any
difficulty, for I can hang by my hands about half the distance, and drop the
remainder."

     As he spoke he took off his coat, and then stuck the link he carried 
into
a cleft of the rock, that was beside the brink of the excavation.

     The baron now saw that there would be no such thing as avoiding a
discovery of the fact of the dead body being in that place, and his only 
hope
was, that in its descent it might have become so injured as to defy
identification.

     But this was a faint hope, because he recollected that he had himself
seen the face, which was turned upwards, and the period after death was by 
far
too short for him to have any hope that decomposition could have taken place
even to the most limited extent.

     The light, which was stuck in a niche, shed but a few inefficient rays
down into the pit, and, as the baron sood, with folded arms, looking calmly
on, he expected each moment a scene of surprise and terror would ensue.

     Nor was he wrong; for scarcely had the man plunged down into that deep
place, than he uttered a cry of alarm and terror, and shouted, --

     "Murder! murder!  Lift me out.  There is a dead man down here, and I 
have
jumped upon him."

     "A dead man!" cried Mr. Leek and Sir John Westlake in a breath.

     "How very strange!" said the baron.

     "Lend me a hand," cried Davis; "lend me a hand out; I cannot stand 
this,
you know.  Lend me a hand out, I say, at once."

     This was easier to speak of than to do, and Mr. Davis began to discover
that it wa easier by far to get into a deep pit, than to get out of one,
notwithstanding that his assertion of having been down into those places was
perfectly true; but then he had met with nothing alarming, and had been able
perfectly at his leisure to scramble out the best way he could.

     Now, however, his frantic efforts to release himself from a much more
uncomfortable situation than he had imagined it possible for him to get 
into,
were of so frantic a nature, that he only half buried himself in pieces of
chalk, which he kept pulling down with vehemence from the sides of the pit,
and succeeded in accomplishing nothing towards his rescue.

     "Oh! the fellow is only joking," said the baron, "and amusing himself 
at
our expense."

     But the manner in which the man cried for help, and the marked terror
which was in every tone, was quite sufficient to prove that he was not 
acting;
for if he were, a more accomplished mimic could not have been found on the
stage than he was.

     "This is serious," said Sir John Westlake, "and cannot be allowed.  
Have
you any ropes here by which we can assist him from the pit?  Don't be 
alarmed,
my man, for if there be a dead body in the pit, it can't harm you.  Take 
your
time quietly and easily, and you will assuredly get out."

     "Aye," said the baron, "the more haste, the worst speed, is an English
proverb, and in this case it will be fully exemplified.  This man would 
easily
leave the pit, if he would have the patience, with care and quietness, to
clamber up its side."

     It would appear that Davis felt the truth of these exhortations, for
although he trembled excessively, he did begin to make some progress in his
ascent, and get so high, that Mr. Leek was enabled to get hold of his hand,
and give him a little assistance, so that, in another minute or so, he was 
rescued from his situation, which was not one of peril, although it was
certainly one of fright.

     He trembled so excessively, and stuttered and stammered, that for some 
minutes no one could understand very well what he said; but at length, upon
making himself intelligible, he exclaimed, --

     "There has been a murder! there has been a murder committed, and the 
body
thrown into the ice pit.  I felt that I jumped down upon something soft, and
when I put down my hand to feel what it was, it came across a dead man's 
face,
and then, of course, I called out."

     "You certainly did call out."

     "Yes, and so would anybody, I think, under such circumstances.  I 
suppose
I shall be hung now, because I had charge of the house?"

     "That did not strike me until this moment," said the baron; "but if 
there
be a dead body in that pit, it certainly places this man in a very awkward
position."

     "What the deuce do you mean?" said Davis; "I don't know no more about 
it
than the child unborn.  There is a dead man in the ice-well, and that is all 
I
know about it; but whether he has been there a long time, or a short time, I
don't know any more than the moon, so it's no use bothering me about it."

     "My good man," said the baron, "it would be very wrong indeed to impute
to you any amount of criminality in this business, since you may be entirely
innocent; and I, for one, believe that you are so, for I cannot think that 
any
guilty man would venture into the place where he had put the body of his
victim, in the way that you ventured into that pit.  I say I cannot believe 
it
possible, and therefore I think you innocent, and will take care to see that
no injustice is done you; but at the same time I cannot help adding, that I
think, of course, you will find yourself suspected in some way."

     "I am very much obliged to you, sir," said Davis; "but as I happen to 
be
quite innocent, I am very easy about it, and don't care one straw what 
people
say.  I have not been in this excavaton for Heaven knows how long."

     "But what's to be done?" said Mr. Leek.  "I suppose it's our duty to do
something, under such circumstances."

     "Unquestionably," said the baron; "and the first thing to be done, is 
to
inform the police of what has happened, so that the body may be got up; and 
as
I have now seen enough of the estate to satisfy me as regards its
capabilities, I decide at once upon taking it, if I can agree upon the
conditions of the tenancy, and I will purchase it, if the price be such as I
think suitable."

     "Well," said Mr. Leek, "if anything could reconcile me to the
extraordinary circumstance that has just occurred, it certainly is, baron, 
the
having so desirble a tenant for Anderbury-on-the-Mount as yourself.  But we
need not traverse all this passage again, for it is much nearer now to get 
out
upon the sea coast at once, as we are so close to the door opening upon the
beach.  It seems to me that we ought to proceed at once to the town, and 
give
information to the authorities of the discovery which we have made."

     "It is absolutely necessary," said the baron, "so to do; so come along 
at
once.  I shall proceed to my inn, and as, of course, I have seen nothing 
more
than yourselves, and consequently could only repeat your evidence, I do not
see that my presence is called for.  Nevertheless, of course, if the 
justices
think it absolutely necessary that I should appear, I can have no possible
objection so to do."

     This was as straightforward as anything that could be desired, and,
moreover, it was rather artfully put together, for it seemed to imply that 
he,
Mr. Leek, would be slighted, if his evidence was not considered sufficient.

     "Of course," said Mr. Leek; "I don't see at all why, as you, sir, have
only the same thing to say as myself, I should not be sufficient."

     "Don't call upon me on any account," said Sir John Westlake.

     "Oh! no, no," cried Mr. Leek; "there is no occasion.  I won't, you may
depend, if it can be helped."

     Sir John, in rather a nervous and excited manner, bade them good day,
before they got quite into the town, and hurried off; while the baron, with 
a
dignified bow, when he reached the door of his hotel, said to Mr. Leek, --

     "Of course I do not like the trouble of judicial investigations more 
than
anybody else, and therefore, unless it is imperatively necessary that I 
should
appear, I shall take it as a favour to be released from such a trouble."

     "My lord baron," said Mr. Leek, "you may depend that I shall mention 
that
to the magistrates and the coroner, and all those sort of people;" and then
Mr. Leek walked away, but he muttered to himself, as he did so, "They will
have him, as sure as fate, just because he is a baron; and his name will 
look
well in the 'County Chronicle.'"

     Mr. Leek then repaired immediately to the house of one of the principal
magistrates, and related what had occurred, to the great surprise of that
gentleman, who suggested immediately the propriety of making the fact known 
to
the coroner of the district, as it was more his business, than a 
magistrate's,
in the first instance, since nobody was accused of the offence.

     This suggestion was immediately followed, and that functionary directed
that the body should be removed from where it was to the nearest public-
house,
and immediately issued his precept for an inquiry into the case.

     By this time the matter had begun to get bruited about in the town, and
of course it went from mouth to mouth with many exaggerations; and although 
it
by no means did follow that a murder had been committed because a dead body
had been found, yet, such was the universal impression; and the matter began
to be talked about as the murder in the subterranean passage leading to
Anderbury House, with all the gusto which the full particulars of some deed 
of
blood was calculated to inspire.  And how it spread about was thus: --

     The fact was, that Mr. Leek was so anxious to let Anderbury-on-the-
Mount
to the rich Baron Stolmuyer, of Saltzburgh, that he got a friend of his to
come and personate Sir John Westlake, while he, the baron, was looking at 
the
premises, in order to drive him at once to a conclusion upon the matter; so
that what made Sir John so very anxious that he should not be called forward
in the matter; consisted in the simple fact that he was nothing else than
plain Mr. Brown, who kept a hatter's shop in the town; but he could not keep
his own counsel, and, instead of holding his tongue, as he ought to have 
done,
about the matter, he told it to every one he met, so that in a short time it
was generally known that something serious and startling had occurred in the
subterranean passage to Anderbury House, and a great mob of persons thronged
the beach in anxious expectation of getting more information on the matter.

     The men, likewise, who had been ordered by the coroner to remove the
body, soon reached the spot, and they gave an increased impetus to the
proceedings, by opening the door of the subterranean passage, and then 
looking
earnestly along the beach as if in expectation of something or somebody of
importance.

     When eagerly questioned by the mob, for the throng of persons now
assembled quite amounted to a mob, to know what they waited for, one of them
said, --

     "A coffin was to have been brought down to take the body in."

     This announcement at once removed anything doubtful that might be in 
the
minds of any of them upon the subject, and at once proclaimed the fact not
only that there was a dead body, but that if they looked out they would see 
it
forthwith.

     The throng thickened, and by the time two men were observed approaching
with a coffin on their shoulders, there was scarcely anybody left in the 
town,
except a few rare persons, indeed, who were not so curious as their
neighbours.

     It was not an agreeable job, even to those men who were not the most
particular in the world, to be removing so loathsome a spectacle as that 
which
they were pretty sure to encounter in the ice-well; but they did not shrink
from it, and, by setting about it as a duty, they got through it tolerably
well.

     They took with them several large torches, and then, one having 
descended
into the pit, fastened a rope under the arms of the dead man, and so he was
hauled out, and placed in the shell that was ready to receive him.

     They were all surprised at the fresh and almost healthful appearance of
the countenance, and it was quite evident to everybody that if any one had
known him in life, they could not have the least possible difficulty in 
recognising him now that he was no more.

     And the only appearance of injury which he exhibited was in that 
dreadful
wound which had certainly proved his death, and which was observable in his
throat the moment they looked upon him.

     The crush to obtain a sight of the body was tremendous at the moment it
was brought out, and a vast concourse of persons followed it in procession 
to
the town, where the greatest excitement prevailed.  It was easily discovered
that no known person was missing; and some who had caught a sight of the 
body,
went so far as to assert that it must have been in the ice-well for years, 
and
that the extreme cold had preserved it in all its original freshness.

     The news, of course, came round, although not through the baron, for he
did not condescend to say one word about it at the inn, and it was the
landlord who first started the suggestion of--

     "What suppose it is the gentleman who left his horse here?"

     This idea had no sooner got possession of his brain, than it each 
moment
seemed to him to assume a more reasonable and tangible form, and without
saying any more to any one else about it, he at once started off to where 
the
body lay awaiting an inquest, to see if his suspicions were correct.

     When he arrived at the public-house and asked to see the body, he was 
at
once permitted to do so; for the landlord knew him, and was as curious as he
could be upon the subject by any possibility.  One glance, of course, was
sufficient, and the landlord at once said, --

     "Yes, I have seen him before, though I don't know his name.  He came to
my house last night, and left his horse there; and, although I only saw him
for a moment as he passed through the hall, I am certain I am not mistaken.  
I
dare say all my waiters will recognise him, as well as the Baron Stolmuyer 
of
Saltzburgh, who is staying with me, and who no doubt knows very well who he
is, for he went out with him late and came home alone; and I ordered one of 
my
men to wait up all night in order to let in this very person who is now 
lying
dead before us."

     "The deuce you did!  But you don't suppose the baron murdered him, do
you?"

     "It's a mystery to me altogether-- quite a profound mystery.  It's very
unlikely, certainly; and what's the most extraordinary part of the whole
affair is, how the deuce could he come into one of the ice-wells belonging 
to
Anderbury House.  That's what puzzles me altogether."

     "Well, it will all come out, I hope, at the inquest, which is to be 
held
at four o'clock to-day.  There must have been foul play somewhere, but the
mystery is where, and that Heaven only knows, perhaps."

     "I shall attend," said the landlord, "of course, to identify him; and I
suppose, unless anybody claims the horse, I may as well keep possession of
it."

     "Don't flatter yourself that you will get the horse out of the
transaction.  Don't you know quite well that the government takes possesson 
of
everything as don't belong to nobody?"

     "Yes; but I have got him, and possession, you know, is nine points of 
the
law."

     "It may be; but their tenth point will get the better of you for all
that.  You take my word for it, the horse will be claimed of you; but I 
don't
mind, as an old acquaintance, putting you up to a dodge."

     "In what way?"

     "Why, I'll tell you what happened with a friend of mine; but don't 
think
it was me, for if it was I would tell you at once, so don't think it.  He 
kept
a country public-house; and, one day, an elderly gentleman came in, and
appeared to be unwell.  He just uttered a word or two, and then dropped down
dead.  He happened to have in his fob a gold repeater, that was worth, at
least, a hundred guineas, and my friend, before anybody came, took it out, 
and
popped in, in its stead, an old watch that he had, which was not worth a
couple of pounds."

     "It was running a risk."

     "It was; but it turned out very well, because the old gentleman 
happened
to be a very eccentric person, and was living alone, so that his friends
really did not know what he had, or what he had not, but took it for granted
that any watch produced belonged to him.  So, if I were you in this case, 
when
the gentleman's horse is claimed, I'd get the d---dest old screw I could, 
and
let them have that."

     "You would?"

     "Indeed would I, and glory in it, too, as the very best thing that 
could
be done.  Now, a horse is of use to you?"

     "I believe ye, it is."

     "Exactly; but what's the use of it to government? and, what's more, if 
it
went to the government, there might be some excuse; but the government will
know no more about it, and make not so much as I shall.  Some Jack-in-office
will lay hold of it as a thing of course and a perquisite, when you might 
just
as well, and a great deal better, too, keep it yourself, for it would do you
some good, as you say, and none to them."

     "I'll do it; it is a good and a happy thought.  There is no reason on
earth why I shouldn't do it, and I will.  I have made up my mind to it now."

     "Well, I am glad you have.  What do you think now the dead man's horse 
is
worth?"

     "Oh! fifty or sixty guineas value."

     "Then very good.  Then, when the affair is all settled, I will trouble
you for twenty pounds.

     "You?"

     "Yes, to be sure.  Who else do you suppose is going to interfere with
you?  One is enough, ain't it, at a time; and I think, after giving you such
advice as I have, that I am entitled, at all events, to something."

     "I tell you what," said the landlord of the hotel, "taking all things
into consideration, I have altered my mind rather, and won't do it."

     "Very good.  You need not; only mind if you do, I am down upon you like 
a
shot."

     The excitement contingent upon the inquest was very great; indeed, the
large room in the public house, where it was held, was crowded to 
suffocation
with persons who were anxious to be present at the proceedings.  When the
landlord reached home, of course he told his guest, the baron, of the
discovery he had made, that the murdered man was the strange visitor of the
previous night; for now, from the frightful wound he had received in his
throat, the belief that he was murdered became too rational a one to admit 
of
any doubts, and was that which was universally adopted in preference to any
other suggestion upon the occasion; although, no doubt, people would be 
found
who would not scruple to aver that he had cut his own throat, after making 
his
way into the well belonging to Anderbury House.

     The landlord had his own misgivings concerning his guest, the baron, 
now
that something had occurred of such an awful and mysterious a nature to one
who was evidently known to him.  It did not seem to be a pleasant thing to
have such an intimate friend of a man who had been murdered in one's house,
especially when it came to be considered that he was the last person seen in
his company, and that, consequently, he was peculiarly called upon to give 
an
explanation of how, and under what circumstances, he had parted with him.

     The baron was sitting smoking in the most unconcerned manner in the
world, when the landlord came to bring him this intelligence, and, when he 
had
heard him to an end, the remark he made was, --

     "Really, you very much surprise me; but, perhaps, as you are better
acquainted with the town than I am, you can tell me who he was?"

     "Why, sir, that is what we hoped you would be able to tell us."

     "How should I tell you?  He introduced himself to me as a Mr. Mitchell, 
a
surveyor, and he said that, hearing I talked of purchasing or renting
Anderbury-on-the-Mount, he came to tell me that the principal side wall, 
that
you could see from the beach, was off the perpendicular."

     "Indeed, sir!"

     "Yes; and as this was a very interesting circumstance to me, 
considering
that I really did contemplate such a purchase or renting, and do so still, 
as
it was a moonlight night, and he said he could show me in a minute what he
meant if I would accompany him, I did so; but when we got there, and on the
road, I heard quite enough of him to convince me that he was a little out of
his senses, and, consequently, I paid no more attention to what he said, but
walked home and left him on the beach."

     "It's a most extraordinary circumstance, sir; there is no such person, 
I
assure you, as Mitchell, a surveyor, in the town; so I can't make it out in
the least." 

     "But, I tell you, I consider the man out of his senses, and perhaps 
that
may account for the whole affair."

     "Oh, yes, sir, that would, certainly; but still, it's a very odd thing,
because we don't know of such a person at all, and it does seem so
extraordinary that he should have made his appearance, all of a sudden, in
this sort of way.  I suppose, sir, that you will attend the inquest, now,
that's to be held upon him?"

     "Oh, yes; I have no objection whatever to that; indeed, I feel myself
bound to do so, because I suppose mine is the the latest evidence that can 
be
at all produced concerning him."

     "Unquestionably, sir; our coroner is a very clever man, and you will be
glad to know him-- very glad to know him, sir, and he will be glad to know
you, so I am sure it will be a mutual gratification.  It's at four o'clock 
the
inquest is to be, and I dare say, sir, if you are there by half-past, it 
will
be time enough."

     "No doubt of that; but I will be punctual."

     We have already said the room in which the inquest was to be held was
crowded almost to suffocation, and not only was that the case, but the lower
part of the house was crammed with people likewise; and there can be very
little doubt but the baron would have shrunk from such an investigation from 
a
number of curious eyes, if he could have done so; while the landlord of the
house would have had no objection, as far as his profit was concerned in the
sale of a great quantity of beer and spirits, to have had such a an 
occurrence
every day in the week, if possible.

     The body lay still in the shell where it had been originally placed. 
After it had been viewed by the jury, and almost every one had remarked upon
the extraordinary fresh appearance it wore, they proceeded at once to the
inquiry, and the first witness who appeared was Mr. Leek, who deposed to 
have
been in company with some gentlemen viewing Anderbury House, and to have 
found
the body in one of the ice-wells of that establishment.

     This evidence was corroborated by that of Davis, who had so 
unexpectedly
jumped into the well, without being aware that it contained already so
disagreeable a visitor as it did in the person of the murdered man, 
regarding
the cause of whose death the present inquiry was instituted.

     Then the landlord identified the body as that of a gentleman who had 
come
to his house on horseback, and who had afterwards walked out with Baron
Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh, who was one of his guests.

     "Is that gentleman in attendance?" said the coroner.

     "Yes, sir, he is; I told him about it, and he has kindly come forward 
to
give all the evidence in his power concerning it."

     There was a general expression of interest and curiosity when the baron
stepped forward, attired in his magnificent coat, trimmed with fur, and
tendered his evidence to the coroner, which, of course, was precisely the 
same
as the statement he had made to the landlord of the house; for, as he had 
made
up such a well connected story, he was not likely to prevaricate or to 
depart
from it in the smallest particular.

     He was listened to with breathless attention, and, when he had 
concluded,
the coroner, with a preparatory hem! said to him,

     "And you have reason to suppose, sir, that this person was out of his
senses?"

     "It seemed to me so; he talked wildly and incoherently, and in such a
manner as to fully induce such a belief."

     "You left him on the beach?"

     "I did.  I found when I got there that it was only a very small 
portion,
indeed, of Anderbury House that was visible; and, although the moon shone
brightly, I must confess I did not see, myself, any signs of deviation from
the perpendicular; and, such being the case, I left the spot at once, 
because
I could have no further motive in staying; and, moreover, it was not 
pleasant
to be out at night with a man whom I thought was deranged.  I regretted, 
after
making this discovery, that I had come from home on such a fool's errand; 
but
as, when one is going to invest a consideralbe sum of money in any 
enterprise,
one is naturally anxious to know all about it, I went, little suspecting 
that
the man was insane."

     "Did you see him after that?"

     "Certainly not, until to-day, when I recognised in the body that has 
been
exhibited to me the same individual."

     "Gentlemen," said the coroner to the jury, "it appears to me that this 
is
a most mysterious affair; the deceased person has a wound in his throat,
which, I have no doubt, you will hear from a medical witness has been the
cause of death; and the most singular part of the affair is, how, if he
inflicted it upon himself, he has managed to dispose of the weapon with 
which
he did the deed."

     "The last person seen in his company," said one of the jury, "was the
baron, and I think he is bound to give some better explanation of the 
affair."

     "I am yet to discover," said the baron, "that the last person who
acknowledges to having been in the company of a man afterwards murdered, 
must,
of necessity, be the murderer?"

     "Yes; but how do you account, sir, for there being no weapon found by
which the man could have done the deed himself?"

     "I don't account for it at all-- how do you?"

     "This is irregular," said the coroner; "call the next witness."

     This was a medical man, who briefly stated that he had seen the 
deceased,
and that the wound in his throat was amply sufficient to account for his
death; that it was inflicted with a sharp instrument having an edge on each
side.

     This, then, seemed to conclude the case, and the coroner remarked, --

     "Gentlemen of the jury, -- I think this is one of those peculiar cases 
in
which an open verdict is necessary, or else an adjournment without date, so
that the matter can be resumed at any time, if fresh evidence can be 
procured
concerning it.  There is no one accused of the offence, although it appears 
to
me impossible that the unhappy man could have committed the act himself.  We
have no reason to throw the least shade of suspicion or doubt upon the
evidence of the Baron Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh; for as far as we know 
anything
of the matter, the murdered man may have been in the company of a dozen 
people
after the baron left him."

     A desultory conversation ensued, which ended in an adjournment of the
inquest, without any future day being mentioned for its re-assembling, and 
so
the Baron Stolmuyer entirely escaped from what might have been a very 
serious
affair to him.

     It did not, however, appear to shake him in his resolution of taking
Anderbury-on-the-Mount, although Mr. Leek very much feared it would; but he
announced to that gentleman his intention fully of doing so, and told him to
get the necessary papers drawn up forthwith.

     "I hope," he said, "within a few weeks' time to be fairly installed in
that mansion, and then I will trouble you, Mr. Leek, to give me a list of 
the
names of all the best families in the neighbourhood; for I intend giving an
entertainment on a grand scale in the mansion and grounds."

     "Sir," said Mr. Leek, "I shall, with the greatest pleasure, attend upon
you in every possible way in this affair.  This is a very excellent
neighbourhood, and you will have no difficulty, I assure you, sir, in 
getting
together an extremely capital and creditable assemblage of persons.  There
could not be a better plan devised for at once introducing all the people 
who
are worth knowing, to you."

     "I thank you," said the baron; "I think the place will suit me well; 
and,
as the Baroness Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh is dead, I have some idea of 
marrying
again; and therefore it becomes necessary and desirable that I should be 
well
acquainted with the surrounding families of distinction in this
neighbourhood."

     This was a hint not at all likely to be thrown away upon Mr. Leek, who
was the grand gossip-monger of the place, and he treasured it up in order to
see if he could not make something of it which would be advantageous to
himself.

     He knew quite enough of the select and fashionable families in that
neighbourhood, to be fully aware that neither the baron's age nor his 
ugliness
would be any bar to his forming a matrimonial alliance.

     "There is not one of them," he said to himself, "who would not marry 
the
very devil himself and be called the Countess Lucifer, or any name of the
kind, always provided there was plenty of money; and that the baron has
without doubt, so it is equally without doubt he may pick and choose where 
he
pleases."

     This was quite correct of Mr. Leek, and showed his great knowledge of
human nature; and we entertain with him a candid opinion, that if the Baron
Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh had been ten times as ugly as he was, and Heaven 
knows
that was needless, he might pick and choose a wife almost when he pleased.

     This is a general rule; and as, of course, to all general rules there 
are
exceptions, this one cannot be supposed to be free from them.  Under all
circumstances, and in all classes of society, there are single-minded beings
who consult the pure dictates of their own hearts, and who, disdaining those
things which make up the amount of the ambition of meaner spirits, stand 
aloof
as bright and memorable examples to the rest of human nature.

     Such a being was Flora Bannerworth.  She would never have been found to
sacrifice herself to the fancied advantages of wealth and station, but would
have given her heart and hand to the true object of her affection, although 
a
sovereign prince had made the endeavour to wean her from it.

 Next Time: The Admiral's Preparations, and the Visit to the Dearbrook.




                               Chapter XCVII.

THE ADMIRAL'S PREPARATIONS, AND THE VISIT TO DEARBROOK.


     It was quite finally settled between the admiral and the Bannerworths
that he was to have the whole conducting of the marriage business, and he 
even
succeeded in getting a concession from Flora Bannerworth, that he might 
invite
more than twenty guests as had at first been stipulated.  Indeed, she told 
him
that he might ask forty if he pleased.

     The admiral had asked for this enlargement of his of powers, because he
had received from the lawyer such a satisfactory list of people who were
eligible to be invited, that he found it extremely difficult to draw any
invidious distinction; and, accordingly, he felt fully inclined, as far as 
he
was concerned, to invite them all, which was a piece of liberality he 
scarcely
expected Flora would accede to.

     When, however, he got leave to double the number, he considered that he
was all right, and he said to Jack Pringle, to whom, as usual, he had got
completely reconciled,--

     "I say, Jack, my boy, we'll have the whole ship's crew, and no mistake;
for, at a wedding, the more the merrier, you know."

     "Ay, ay, sir," said Jack, "that's true.  I have not been married more
than a dozen times myself, at the outside, and I always took care to have 
lots
of fun."

     "A dozen times, Jack! you don't mean that?"

     "I rather think I does.  You know I was married at different ports of
India twice; and then wasn't I married in Jamaky; and then after that wasn't 
I
married in the South Seas, in one of the Friendly Islands?"

     "A deuced deal too friendly, I should say.  Why, confound you, Jack, 
you
must have the impudence of the very devil."

     "Yes, I believe ye I have.  I look upon it that it's our impudence has
got us on in the world."

     "How dare you say our, you vagabond?  But, however, I won't quarrel 
with
you now, at any rate, for I expect you to dance a hornpipe at the wedding. 
But mind me now, Jack, I am serious-- I won't have any drunkenness."

     "Well, it's rather a hard thing that a fellow can't get drunk at a
wedding; but I suppose I must put up with that deadly injury, and do the 
best
I can.  And now, admiral, as you have looked over that little affair of 
mine,
in going to the lawyer's when you didn't want me, I'll make you a voluntary
promise, and that is, that I'll only take two bottles all the day long."

     "Two bottles of what?"

     "Oh, rum, of course."

     "Well, that's moderate; for as I have known you, I think, take about
five, of course I can't very well say anything to two; so you may take that
much, Jack, for I really think you won't be much the worse of it."

     "The worse of it!  I should think not, sir.  It rather strikes me that
two bottles of rum wouldn't hurt a new-born baby.  It's just for all the 
world
like milk, you know; it has no effect upon me; and as far as being fond of
drink goes, I'd just as soon take pump water, if it had a different taste, 
and
was a d---d deal stronger."

     "Well, well, Jack, that's a bargain, you know, so we need say nothing
more about it."

     "I suppose there will be a fiddle, and all that sort of thing?"

     "Oh, don't doubt that there shall be lots of fun."

     "Then I am your man.  I'll show them a thing or two that will make them
open their eyes a bit; and if so be as they wants anything in the shape of a
yarn, I'm the proper sort of individual to give it them, I rather think, and
no mistake.  I'll tell them how you ran away once, with a female savage 
after
you, with a long thing like a skewer, that she called a spear, and how you
called to all the ship's crew to come and help you, as if the very devil was
at your heels."

     Jack very prudently did not wait for an answer to this; for he was 
rather
well aware that it was not the sort of thing that was exactly pleasing to 
the
admiral, who was just upon the point, of course, of getting into one of his
rages, which would have produced another quarrel, only, as a matter of 
course,
to end in another reconciliation.

     The old man, however, was too well pleased with the unlimited 
commission
he had to do as he pleased regarding the marriage affair, to allow himself 
to
be put much out of the way in the matter, and he bent all his mind and
energies towards the completion of that piece of business which he had in
hand, and which was certainly the most interesting to him that he had ever
been permitted to engage in.

     Passing as he did almost the whole of his life upon the ocean, he had
never married, and his affection for Charles Holland, who was the only
relative he had in the world, was of that concentrated nature which is only 
to
be found under such circumstances.

     Charles's mother had always had a large portion of the admiral's 
regards,
and when upon returning home once from a cruise of three years' duration he
found that she was dead, and had left behind her an orphan child, he at once
avowed his intention  of filling the place of a parent to it, and that he 
had
both in the spirit and the letter kept his word, we know that Charles 
Holland
was always most ready to admit.

     Perhaps the severest shock he ever experienced was when that letter
purporting to be from Charles, but which was really the production of
Marchdale and Varney, was produced, and which seemed at the first blush to
imply a dishonourable breaking of his contract with Flora; and if anything
could have increased his admiration of her, it certainly was the generous 
and
noble manner in which she repudiated that attempt to injure Charles in her
esteem, and at once declared her belief that the letter was a forged 
document.

     We may easily imagine, then, from these preceding circumstances, that 
the
marriage of Charles with one whom he so entirely approved of was one of the
most gratifying affairs in the old man's life, and that he viewed it with an
extraordinary interest.

     As we have before stated, he got possession for a month of the house on
which he had fixed his fancy, and an extremely handsome and commodious place
it was.

     It was arranged that after they had remained there for some time they
should all move off to Dearbrook together, and as it was only in early 
infancy
that the Barnnerworths had seen that estate, they purposed paying it a visit
before the marriage ceremony took place.

     This was an idea of the old admiral's, for he said truly enough, "You
can't possibly know what state it is in till you go there, and it may be
necessary, for all we know, to do a great deal to it before it is fit for
occupation."

     Apart from this consideration, too, it seemed likely enough that 
somebody
might be in it; for of late it had changed hands, and, for all they knew, 
the
Bannerworth family might have to institute a suit at law for its recovery.

     The distance was sufficient to make it a whole day's journey; but it 
was
a very pleasant one, for they went in a travelling carriage, replete with
every accommodation, and the road passed through one of the most fertile and
picturesque counties of England, being interspersed with hill and dale most
charmingly, and reminding the younger branches of the Bannerworths of some 
of
those delightful continental excursions which they once had the means of
making, but which, for a long time, they had not had an opportunity of
enjoying.

     It was towards the close of a day of great beauty, for the season, that
they reached the village of Dearbrook, close to where the estate was 
situated,
and put up at the principal inn, to which they were directed.

     The circumstances under which the Dearbrook property had been left for 
a
long time had been such, that there was likely to be some difficulty
concerning it.

     In fact, it had been used by Marmaduke Bannerworth as a kind of 
security
from time to time for his gambling debts, so it was probable that hardly any
one had had it long enough to trouble himself about rentals.

     "If we find any one," said Henry Bannerworth, "in possession, I shall 
not
trouble them to pay anything for the use of the house they have had, 
provided
they quietly give up possession, and leave the place in a decent state."

     "Oh, that of course they will do," said Charles Holland, "and be too 
glad
to escape arrears of rent; but it would be no bad thing to ask the landlord 
of
this house what is the state of the property; no doubt he can not only let 
us
know whether it be tenanted or not, but, if so, what sort of people they are
who occupy it."

     This suggestion was agreed to, and when the landlord was summoned, and
the question put, he said, --

     "Oh, yes, I know the Dearbrook estate quite well; it's a very handsome
little property, and is at present occupied by a Mr. Jeremiah Shepherd, a
Quaker-- a very worthy gentleman indeed, I believe; but I suppose all 
Quakers
are worthy people, because, you see, sir, they wear broad brimmed hats and 
no
collars to their coats."

     "An excellent reason," said the admiral; "but I had a friend who did 
know
something about Quakers, and he used to say that they had got such a 
reputation for honesty that they could affort to be rogues for the rest of
their existence."

     "Well, well," said Henry, "we can but call upon him.  Do you think that
this would be a reasonable hour?"

     "Oh, yes, sir," said the landlord; "he is sure to be at home at this 
hour
if you have any business to transact with Mr. Shepherd.  He is a very
respectable man, sir, and as it is his own property that he lives upon, he 
is
quite a gentleman, and never wears anything but drab breeches and gaiters."

     Without waiting to enter into any further conversation with the 
landlord,
who had such extraordinary reasons for his opinions, Henry, and Charles, and
the admiral, leaving the rest of the party at the inn, proceeded to 
Dearbrook
Lodge, as it was called, and found as they approached it that it exceeded in
appearance their warmest anticipations.

     It was a substantial red brick house, of the Tudor style of 
architecture,
and had that air of dignified and quite repose about it which a magnificent
lawn, of the greenest possible turf, in the front always gives to a country
mansion.

     The grounds, too, seemed to be extensive, and, to take it for all in 
all,
the Bannerworth family had every reason to be well pleased with this first
view that they got of their acquired property.

     "You will have some trouble," said the admiral, "with the Quaker, you 
may
depend.  They are a race that cry hold fast to anything in the shape of
pounds, shillings, and pence, and are not very easy to be dealt with."

     "Oh, the man will not be so absurd, I should think," said Charles.  "It
can be proved that the estate was in the Bannerworth family for many years,
and your possession, Henry, of the title deeds will set the question at 
rest. 
But see what a stately looking servant is coming in answer to the ring which 
I
have just given to the bell."

     A footman, most certainly having all the appearance of what is so
frequently advertised for as "a serious man servant," advanced to the gate,
and, in answer to the inquiry if Mr. Shepherd was within, he said, --

     "Yes, truly is he; but he liketh not to be disturbed, for he is at
prayers-- that is to say, at dinner, and is not accustomed to be disturbed
thereat."

     "I regret that we must disturb him," said Henry, "for our business
happens to be important, and we must positively see him."

     Upon this remonstrance the servant unlocked the gate, and conducted 
them
up a path by the side of the lawn which led to the house, and the more they
saw of it the more pleased they were with the many natural beauties with 
which
it abounded, and Henry whispered to Charles, --

     "I am quite sure that Flora will be delighted with this place, for, if 
I
know anything of her taste, it will just suit it agreeably and comfortably,
and I do sincerely hope that we shall be able to get possession without the
disagreeable necessity of a law suit."

     They were ushered into a handsome apartment, and then told that Mr.
Shepherd would be with them very shortly; and they were not sorry to have a
little leisure for studying the place before its reputed owner made his
appearance.

     "I suppose," said Henry, "the best way will be at once to state that I 
am
the owner of the place, and upon what conditions I am willing to forego any
claim that I might otherwise succeed in setting up for arrears of rental
during the time that he has been here."

     "Oh, yes," said Charles; "you cannot be too explicit; but hush! here he
comes, and you will soon know what sort of an individual you have to deal 
with
in this matter."

     At this moment, the door opened, and Mr. Shepherd, the present 
ostensible
possessor of the Dearbrook estate, and whose appearance spoke to the truth 
of
the landlord's word, make his appearance.  But as what he said was
sufficiently important to deserve a new chapter, we shall oblige him with 
one.

 Next Time: The Interview with the Quaker at Dearbrook.




                               Chapter XCVIII.

THE INTERVIEW WITH THE QUAKER AT DEARBROOK.


     The Quaker was a man of about middle age, and was duly attired in the
garb of the particular sect to which he belonged.  There was about his
countenance all that affectation of calmness and abandonment of worldly
thoughts and desires which is mistaken by so many people for the reality of
self-denial, when, really, those who know this sect well, are perfectly 
aware
that there is not a more money-loving, grasping people on the face of the
earth.

     After gravely motioning his visitors to be seated, Mr. Shepherd cast 
his
eyes up to the ceiling, as if he were muttering some prayer, and then he 
said,
--

     "Verily, may I ask to what I am to attribute this visit from 
individuals
who, in this vale of unblessedness, are unknown to me."

     "Certainly, sir," said Henry; "you are entitled, of course, at once, to
such an explanation of us.  I have called upon you because I am the 
proprietor
of this estate, to know how it is that you became in possession of it, and
under what pretence you hold that possession?"

     Mr. Shepherd slightly changed colour, and staggered back a pace or two
before he said, --

     "The property is mine, but I naturally  decline to produce my title to
any body who may ask for it.  Thou mayest go, now; behind, thee is the 
door."

     "Mr. Shepherd," said Henry, "I am fully in a conditon, as to means and
evidence both, to prove my title to the estate, and an action of ejectment
will soon force you from it; but I am unwilling, under any circumstances, to
do what I fully may do if anything short of that will answer my purpose.  I
therefore give you fair notice, that if, upon my convincing you that I am 
the
owner of the estate, you go out quietly within fourteen days, I will make no
inquiry as to how long you have been here, and will say nothing whatever 
upon
the subject of rental owing to me on account of such occupation."

     "I defy thee, friend," said the Quaker; "and if thou givest me any
trouble I shall put thee in Chancery, from whence thou wilt not get out for
the term of thy natural life; so I give thee due notice, and thou mayest
please thyself in the transaction; and again I tell thee the door is exactly
behind thee, out of which I beg to request thou shouldest at once walk."

     "I tell you what, Mr. Quaker," said the admiral, who had with 
difficulty
restrained himself thus far, "I look upon you as one of the greatest humbugs
ever I came across, and that's saying a great deal, for in my time I have 
come
across some thumpers; and if we don't make you smart for this confounded
obstinancy, you wolf in sheep's clothing, we will know the reason why.  If 
it
costs me a thousand pounds I will make you suffer for it."

     "Thou mayest be damned, friend," said the Quaker; "possession is a 
great
number of points of the law, and, as I have it, I mean to keep it.  I have a
friend who is in the law, and who will put thee as comfortably in Chancery,
and with as little expense to me as possible.  This is a very charming 
estate,
and I have not the slighest intention of giving it up."

     "But you must," said Charles, "give it up to the right owner.  How can 
you be so foolish as to run yourself to legal expenses for nothing?"

     "Teach thy grandmother, young man, to suck eggs," said the Quaker.  "I
wish thee all a remarkably good day, and thou mayest all return from whence 
thou camest, and hang thyselves, if thou pleasest, for all I care; and 
having
made up my mind to live and die on this very pleasant property.  I shall 
have
to put thee all into Chancery."

     "Why, you canting thief!" said the admiral.

     "Thou mayest be damned," said the Quaker.  "In speaking so to thee, I 
use
the language which I am perfectly well aware thou wilt best understand; so I
say unto thee again, thou mayest be damned.  Obediah, show these sinners off
the premises; and, should they refuse to go with that quickness that shall
seem to be fitting and proper, thou mayest urge them on with divers kicks on
their hinder persons, and thou mayst likewise call to thy aid, Towzer, the
large dog, to bite singularly great mouthfuls out of them."

     The Quaker turned, and was walking in a very stately manner out of the
room, when the admiral stepped forward, and exhilarated his movements with
such a kick, that away he went as if he had been shot out of a gun.

     "There, friend," said the admiral, "since you seem found of kicking, I
think that is a very good beginning.  It strikes me you didn't know who you
had to deal with; and now, Mr. Obediah, it's your turn, and we'll manage
Towzer when we get outside."

     "I think thee all the same, friend," said Obediah, "but would rather be
excused."

     "Perhaps you would like your nose pulled instead, then?"

     "No, friend, it is quite long enough already; and I shall take myself 
off
to the lower regions of these premises forthwith."

     So saying, Obediah rushed from the room with great precipitancy, 
leaving,
most ceratinly, the admiral and his party masters of the field; and although
both Henry and Charles both disapproved of the assault which the admiral had
committed, they could not interfere for laughing, and, as they left the 
house,
which they did now of their own accord, Charles said,--

     "Uncle, you may depend you will be pulled up to the quarter session."

     "Damn the quarter session!" said the admiral.  "Do you think I was 
going
to sit still, quietly, while that vagabond promised to kick me; but, as it 
is,
it's all up with coming to Dearbrook to live for one while to come; for, if 
he
is really as good as his word, and puts the matter into Chancery, there's an
end of it.  I have heard it's like ducking in head foremost into a hollow
tree, with a wasp's nest at the bottom of it; you may kick, but I'll be 
damned
if you can get out."

     "Well," said Henry, "I believe that's rather an apt illustration; but 
we
must do the best we can in such a case, and, in the meantime, seek out some
other place to reside in.  Your friend, the little lawyer in the town, shall
have the case to conduct for us, and perhaps, after all, we shall defeat the
Quaker sooner than you imagine."

     "I long to see the day come," said the admiral, "when that fellow will
have to troop out of the place; for, in all my life, I never did know such
confounded impudence as he treated us with."

     "Never mind, never mind," said Charles; "the time must come, of course,
when this pleasant estate, to which we have taken such a fancy, will be 
ours;
and, until then, we shall have no difficulty whatever in finding some sweet
verdant spot, full of exquisite and natural beauties, which we can make a 
home
of well and easily, caring nothing for being a short time only kept from
possession of that which, of right, shall, in a short time, belong to us; 
and
there is one thing that I am rejoiced at, which is, that Flora has not seen
this place; so that she can have no regret about it, because she don't know 
of
its existence farther than by name, and it can hold no place in her
imagination which could make it a subject matter of regret."

     When they reached the inn, they informed Mrs. Bannerworth and Flora of
the ill success of their enterprise, and of the obstinacy of the tenant of 
the
house; and on that evening they had a good laugh with each other about the
little scene that had occurred between the admiral and the Quaker; so that,
upon the whole, perhaps, they were quite as happy -- for people can but 
laugh
and be merry -- as if they had at once got possession of the Dearbrook 
estate
without any trouble or difficulty whatever.

     They determined upon staying there for that night, although they might
have got fresh horses and gone back, if it had pleased them so to do; but
there was much to tempt them in the romantic scenery, around which they took 
a
stroll, when it was lit up by the sweet moonlight, and everything came out 
in
silvery relief, looking so beautiful and serene, so pensively quiet and so
admirable, that it was calculated to draw the mind entirely from all thought
of earthly matters, and to completely rid them of even the shadow of an
annoyance connected with that Dearbrook property which was so wrongfully
detained from them.

     "It is at such seasons as this," said Flora, "that contentment steals
into the heart, and we really feel with how little we should be satisfied,
provided it be sufficient to insure those ordinary comforts of existence 
which
we all look for."

     "It is, indeed," said Charles; "and you and I, Flora, would not repine 
if
our lot had been much more humble than it is, provided Heaven had left us
youth and love."

     "Those, indeed," said Henry, "are dear possessions."

     "Well, then," remarked the admiral, "you have got youth on your side, 
and
I once knew a worse looking fellow than even you are; so why don't you fall 
in
love with somebody at once?"

     "Don't make so sure, uncle," said Flora archly, "that he has not."

     The old admiral laughed -- for he liked Flora to call him uncle, and
said, --

     "You shall tell me all about it, Flora, some day when we are alone; but
not now, while these chaps are listening to every word we utter."

     "I will," said Flora; "it's a grand secret of Henry's, which I am
determined to tell."

     "That's very unkind of you," said Henry, "to say the least of it."

     "Not at all.  If your had trusted me, Henry, it would be quite another
thing; but as I found it out from my own natural sagacity, I cannot see that 
I am bound in the slightest to bestow upon you any consolation on acount of
it, or to shew you any mercy on the subject."

     "And she hopes," said Charles, "that that will be a lesson to you to 
tell
her upon another occasion everything whatever, without the slightest stint 
or
hindrance."

     "I stand convicted," said Henry; "and my only consolation is, that I
don't mind a straw the admiral knowing all about it, and I meant to tell him
myself, as a matter of course."

     "Did you?" said the admiral; "that's a very good attempt to get out of
it; but it won't answer exactly, Henry, with those who know better; so say 
no
more."

     In such light and pleasant conversation they passed some time, until 
the
chill night air, grateful and pleasant as it was to the senses, made them
think it prudent to retire to the inn again.

     After they had partaken of the evening meal, and Flora and Mrs.
Bannerworth had retired to rest, the gentlemen sat up, at the express desire
of the admiral, to talk over the affair upon which they were all in common 
so
deeply interested.

     A general feeling of anxiety evidently pervaded all their minds to
ascertain something of the whereabouts or the fate of Varney, who had so 
very
mysteriously taken himself off at a time when they least of all expected he
would have executed such a manoeuvre.

     "You all see," said the admiral, "that what is bred in the bone, as I
told you, will never be out of the flesh; and this vampyre fellow could not
possibly be quiet, you see, for long, but he must be at his old tricks."

     "I do not know," said Charles Holland, "but I am rather inclined to 
think
that he has somehow become aware that he had become rather a trouble to us,
and so his pride, of which I think we have had evidence enough that he has a
large share of, took the alarm; and he went off as quick as he could."

     "It may be so," said Henry; "and, of course, in the absence of anything
to the contrary, I feel inclined to give even Varney, the Vampyre, credit 
for
as much purity of motive as I can."

     "That's all very well, in its way," said the admiral; "but you must
acknowledge that he did not leave in the most polite manner in the world; 
and
then I, for one, cannot exactly approve of his jumping upon Dr.
Chillingworth's back, from off a garden wall, as a cat would upon a mouse."

     "Be liberal, uncle," said Charles, "and recollect that we are not quite
sure it was Varney, for the doctor declines to be positive upon the subject,
and he ought to know."

     "Stuff," said the admiral; "the doctor knows well enough; but he is 
like
the man that threatened to kick the other for laughing at his wife-- he said
he was sure he had done it, but if he had been d---d sure, he would have
kicked him into the middle of next week."

     "Certainly," said Charles, "the doctor seems quite clearly of opinion,
that whoever committed that assault upon him, did so with a full knowledge 
of
the worth of the picture, which he believes contained within its extra 
lining,
bank notes to a large amount."

     "And which," said Henry, "after all, is but a supposition, and Varney,
after such an attempt to possess himself of such a treasure, if it was he 
that
made it, may be actually now a houseless wanderer; but I consider that such
has been the notoriety of his proceedings, that if he now attempts any 
vampyre
tricks, he very soon will be discovered, and we shall hear of him."

     "From his own account," said Charles Holland, "he has not been the most
scrupulous person in the world with regard to the means by which he has, 
from
time to time, recruited an exhausted exchequer; and we can easily imagine 
that
this vampyre business of his would so terrify and paralyse people, that he
would have little difficulty in robbing a house under such circumstances."

     "You may depend," added Charles, "that he has done one of two things.  
He
has either commenced a much more reckless career than ever he has yet
attempted, or he has gone away completely into obscurity, and will never be
heard of again.  I sincerely myself hope that the latter is the case, for it
will be better for him, and better for everybody connected with him."

     "Hang the fellow," said the admiral; "I should not like him to starve,
although he has given us so much trouble; and I hope that if anything very
queer happens to him, he will not scruple to let us know, and he shall not
positively want.  But come, is it to be another tumbler a-piece, or to bed?"

     Bed was voted, for such they knew was the admiral's wish, or he never
would have mentioned the alternative; and in the course of another half hour
the whole of these persons, in whose fate we profess to have so profound an
interest, were wrapped in repose.

     We will now turn to a consideration of what this singular and 
mysterious
Baron Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh was about, for that he has some ulterior 
objects
in view, which, by no means, at present, shew themselves, we cannot doubt;
and, likewise, there can be no question but that very shortly some of his
views and projects will develop themselves.

 Next Time: The Baron Becomes Master of Anderbury-on-the-Mount, and Begins 
to
 Congratulate Himself. -- The Dream.




                               Chapter XCIX.

THE BARON BECOMES MASTER OF ANDERBURY-ON-THE-MOUNT, AND BEGINS TO 
CONGRATULATE
HIMSELF. -- THE DREAM.


     It was a wonderful relief to Mr. Leek to find that the fact of a dead
body having been found in the subterranean passage of Anderbury House, was
really no bar to the baron possessing himself of those premises.

     Mr. Leek could not disguise from himself that, to many persons, it 
would
have been a serious impediment, and the very mystery in which that affair 
was
still wrapped up, would have made the impediment greater, because people 
don't
so much think of a murder, which is all found out, and for which the
perpetrator suffers; but a murdered body found, and yet no murderer, keeps
public curiosity upon the stretch, and is almost certain destruction to 
house
property.

     But now, whether the baron bought Anderbury House, or rented it, was 
much
the same to Mr. Leek; for, in the former case, he got his per centage all at
once; and, in the latter, acting as agent, he got more, but he got it by
degrees.

     He waited, therefore, with some degree of feverish impatience to know
which way that illustrious individual would make up his mind; and when he
said, at length, in his strange calm way, that he would give 10,000 pounds 
for
Anderbury-on-the-Mount, Mr. Leek wrote off, in violent haste, to the owner,
advising him to accept the same without delay; and, as the owner never
intended again to set foot in Anderbury House, and, moreover, wanted money, 
he
wrote back again in as violent haste that he would take 10,000 pounds most
certainly, and wished the transaction concluded as quickly as it very well
could be, promising Mr. Leek, which was a very gratifying thing to that
gentleman, not on account of the money, as he himself said, "Oh, dear, no!"
but as a matter of feeling, a handsome bonus, in addition to his per 
centage,
if he quickly got the matter completed.

     Armed with this authority, the agent showed an amount of generalship
which must, if he had been placed in the situation of Field Marshal the Duke
of Wellington, have won for him all the continental battles.

     He went at once to the baron, and told him that he had received a 
letter
from the owner of Anderbury-on-the-Mount, asking 10,500 pounds for the 
estate,
but leaving it at his, Mr. Leek's option to take 10,000 pounds if he chose.

     "Now, my lord baron," said Mr. Leek, "business is business, and I may 
as
well put 250 pounds in my pocket, and your lordship put 250 pounds in yours,
as not."

     "That is to say," said the baron, "that you are willing to sell your
employer's interest to me."

     "Oh, why, it isn't exactly that, you know, my lord; only you know, in
these transactions, everybody does the best he can for himself; and I am 
sure
I should be very sorry if you thought that-- that----"

     "Mr. Leek," interrupted the baron, "you need have no delicacy with me,
whatever.  I believe you to be as great a rogue as ever stepped; so you need
make no excuses, only, of course, you cannot expect me to assist you in your
villany-- that is quite out of the question; so you will understand that I
decline giving more than the 10,000 pounds for Anderbury House; and, if that
is not accepted in one hour from this time, I will not have it at all."

     "It's accepted now at once," groaned Mr. Leek, who found that the baron
was too many for him.  "It's accepted at once, my lord; and I beg that you
will bury the past in what do you call it-- oblivion."

     "Very good," said the baron.  "I presume, if I give you a check for a
thousand pounds as a deposit, I may have possession at once, while the deeds
are preparing."

     "Certainly, my lord baron; oh! certainly."

     The baron then gave Mr. Leek, and took his acknowledgment for the same, 
a
check for a thousand pounds on one of the most eminent banking-houses in
London; and in two hours from that time, such was the celerity and precision
of his movements, he took possession of Anderbury House, and engaged the man
and woman who had been minding it to be his temporary servants, until he 
could
get up an establishment suitable to his rank, and the place he inhabited.

     It would have been a strange sight to Mr. Leek, and would have made him
open his eyes a little with wonder, if he could have seen the baron 
traversing
the apartments of Anderbury House alone.

     "And am I at last settled?" he said to himself, as he stood in a large
saloon.  "Am I at last settled in a home such as I can really call my own? -
-
and shall I not be hunted from it by my enemies?  Let me consider-- I will 
be
quick in giving such an entertainment here, that it shall be talked of for
many a day to come.  It shall be such an entertainment as shall present to 
me
all of youth, beauty, rank, and wealth, that can be found in the
neighbourhood; and out of them I will choose some one who shall be the
baroness, and, for a time, pace the stately halls as their mistress-- for a
time; yes, I have said only for a time.  I wonder if there be a family vault
to this property, because, if there be, I may want to use it."

     In this purchase of Anderbury on-the-Mount, the ancient furniture of 
the
place had been all included; so that, in truth, the baron had but to walk in
and to find himself, if he could make himself so, quite at home.

     A costly bed-chamber was prepared for him; the bed-linen and furniture 
of
which was sent by Mr. Leek from his own house; and, no doubt, he fully
intended to be well paid for the same.

     The baron, after about two hours spent in the examination of his house,
sat down in one of the principal apartments, and partook of a very slight
repast; and after that, folding his arms upon his bosom, he seemed to give
himself up to thought entirely; and from the smile that occasionally showed
itself on his remarkable physiognomy, it would seem that those thoughts of 
his
were of a pleasant and felicitous character.

     Now and then, too, from a few and unsettled words that fell from his
lips, it would seem as if he were greatly felicitating himself upon 
something
which he had achieved that was of a character to give him intense
satisfaction.

     Perhaps it was the death of this singular man who called upon him, that
gave him so much pleasure; and we are inclined to think that was the case,
for, after the commission of a murder such as that, one of two feelings were
pretty sure to possess him.

     Remorse might take possession of him, and he might suffer much mental
anguish in consequence of the deed; or the object which he achieved by that
death might be of such a nature as to become quite a subject of
congratulation, so as, whenever, he thought upon it, to give him the
pleasantest and most delightful feelings.

     It looked very much as if this was the case as regarded the baron,
because it was as clear and evident as the sun at noon day, that he had felt
no degree of remorse or regret for that deed; and that, as regards his
conscience, certainly the murder he had committed sat as easy upon it as
anything well could.

     The evening was now drawing on, and the large apartments of the ancient
house began to be enveloped in gloom; but, unlike the generality of persons
who have committed crimes, and whose consciences are charged with injustice,
the gathering gloom of night seemed to have no terror whatever for the Baron
Stolmuyer.

     But at length, with something of a sense of weariness, he rose and rang
for attendance, desiring to be shown to the bedchamber which had been 
prepared
for his reception.

     It was a strange thing; but it seemed to be customary with him not to
undress when he retired to rest; but, as he had done at the hotel, he only
took off a portion of his apparel, and then cast himself upon the bed, and, 
in
a few moments, it seemed as if a deep repose crept over him.

     We say seemed; but, in reality, it was a disturbed and anxious sleep
which the baron had; and soon he began to toss his arms to and fro 
restlessly,
and to utter deep groans, indicative of mental anguish.

     Occasionally, likewise, a muttered word or two, scarcely articulately
pronounced, would come from his lips, such as -- "Save me, save me!  Not 
yet,
not yet-- my doom-- no-- no-- the moonlight-- the moonlight-- kill him--
strike him down!"

     This state of mind continued for a considerable time, until with a 
shrill
cry he sprung to his feet, and stood in an attitude of horror, trembling in
every limb, and exhibiting a most horrible and frightful picture of mental
distress.

     Then there came a loud knocking at his chamber-door, and the voice of 
the
man Davis, who had been alarmed at the strange shriek that had come from the
baron's lips fell upon his ears.  The sound of any human voice, at such a
time, was like music to him.

     "Are you ill, sir?" cried Davis; "are you ill?"

     "No-- no-- it was nothing but a dream-- only a dream;" and then he 
added
to himself, "but it was a dream of such absolute horror, that I shall dread 
to
close my eyes in rest again, lest once more so fearful a vision should greet
me.  It was a dream of such frightful significance, that it will live in my
remembrance like a reality, and be dreamed of again as such."

     He sat down, and wiped the cold perspiration from his brow; then 
rising,
he walked with unsteady steps towards the window, and throwing aside the
massive curtain which shut out the night without by making a still deeper
night within, a flood of beautiful and tender moonlight fell into the
apartment.

     As the cold rays fell upon his face, he breathed more freely, and 
seemed
more to revive beneath their influence than as if he had suddenly found the
bright sunshine beaming upon him in all the refulgence of its mid-day glory.

     "I am better now," he muttered; "I am much better now.  What a fearful
vision that was which came across my heated fancy!  Welcome, welcome,
beautiful moonbeams, welcome; for deep in my very heart I feel your cheering
influence now."

     The violent trembling which had seized him passed away, and once more 
he
resumed his wonted composure and calm hideousness of expression, if we may 
be
allowed the word.

     Now, for some time, he sat in silence, and then, in a low deep tone, he
spoke.

     "It was a strange dream!  A dream made up of strange fancies and 
strange
impulses!  I thought that I stood in a vaulted chamber, and that all around 
me
depicted nothing but gloom and desolation; but, as I there stood, the 
chamber
filled with hideous forms, coming from where I knew not, but still crowding,
crowding in, until the shadow of the merest shade could not have found a
place.

     "And so they crushed me into the smallest possible space; and there I
stood, with a hundred grinning faces close around me, and in such a mad
paroxysm of terror, that I would have given the world for escape from that
dreadful thraldom.

     "But they gibed at me, filling my ears with shrieking noises, and then 
at
once there was a proposition-- a proposition yelled out with shrieking
vehemence by every voice.  It was, to place me in the tombs even as I was, a
living man.

     "'Heap mountains of earth upon him,' cried a voice.  'Endow him with 
the
rare gift of immortality, and then let him lie buried for thousands of years
yet to come.'

     "They seized upon me, those gaunt and terrific forms, and deep into the
bowels of the earth I was hurried-- a depth beyond all calculation; and when 
I
thought my fate was sealed, a change came over me, and I found myself in one
of the ice-wells of this mansion, cold and death-like, while a crowd of 
eager,
curious faces, illumined by the light of torches, gazed down upon me, but no
one spoke; and then they began to cast large fragments of the rocky cliff 
upon
me.

     "I called for aid, and asked for death; but still they proceeded to 
fill
up the pit, while I lay, incapable of anything but agonised thought, at the
bottom of it.

     "Then it was, I presume, that in my despair I shook off that fearful
slumber and awakened."

     He was silent, and seemed again much to rejoice in the moonbeams, as 
they
fell upon his face; and, after a time, in order, it would appear, that he
might feel more of their influence, he opened the window, and stepped out 
upon
a balcony which was immediately in front of it.

     The view that he now had was a beautiful one in the extreme, spreading
far over, in one direction, a beautiful tract of highly cultivated country;
and on the other, as far as the eye could reach, upon the boundless ocean, 
on
which the moonbeams fell with such beauty and power, that, still and placid 
as
the waters were on that particular night, the sea looked like a sheet of
radiant silver, broken into gentle irregularities.

     It was a scene upon which a poet or a painter -- but painters should 
all
be poets, although poets may not be painters -- might gaze with rapture and
delight.

     Not the slightest breath of air stirred the gentlest leaf upon a forest
tree; but such a calmness and such a serenity reigned over all things, that
one might imagine oneself looking upon some new and beautiful world, the
harmony of which had never yet been disturbed by the jarring sounds of
elemental strife.

     Strange thoughts and feelings seemed to come over the baron, as he then
looked upon that mild and placid scene without, and, after a time, he spoke,
saying, --

     "And what do I struggle for now?"  What is it now but mere existence 
that
is the end and aim of all these anxious thoughts and feelings?  Nothing 
more,
nothing more, but the mere liberty to breathe and to be anxious-- the 
capacity
to endure pain.  That is what I live for-- nothing else-- nothing else in 
the
wide world; for when and how can I expect that calm contentment of the soul
which man takes such pains to cast from him, but which I know the full value
of, can ever be mine?"

     Once more he cast his eyes around him, upon the great extent of
cultivated country, and although he felt he could call the most of it, that
lay immediately beneath his observation, his own, it yet gave him but little
gratification to do so, and probably he looked with about as much 
indifference
upon his own possessions as any one possibly could.

     "This is a new career," he said, "and something tells me that it is my
last; so, while it continues, I will not shrink from it, but, on the 
contrary,
enjoy it; and I will endeavour to lose the recollection of those stormy
periods of my existence which have passed away in a complete round and whirl
of what the world calls enjoyments and delights.  I will spend large sums on
brilliant entertainments, and this house, which they tell me has been so 
long
deserted by everything in the shape of festivity and hilarity, shall once
again ring with joyous laughter, and I will make an endeavour to forget what 
I
am."

     He evidently dreaded again to lie down to repose, for, after some time
further spent in thought, and in the expression of the feelings that lay
uppermost in his mind, he put on again that portion of his apparel which he
had taken off.

     "In this soft and pleasant moonlight," he said, "which is so grateful 
to
my senses, I will walk in the gardens of this mansion; and, should a sense 
of
weariness oppress me, I shall be able to find, no doubt, some pleasant spot
where I can lie down to rest, and I shall not fear horrifying or anxious
dreams when I can repose beneath the beams of the moon, which cool my 
fevered
brow."

     With a slow and stately step he moved across the long and beautiful
corridor from which his chamber opened, and then, descending the grand
staircase, and in that house a grand staircase it really was, he made his 
way
across the hall, and, undoing the fastening of a window which opened into a
large and handsome conservatory, he passed through that again, and soon 
found
himself in the extensive gardens of Anderbury.

     Certainly, if there be any sight more chaste and beautiful than 
another,
it is a highly-cultivated and well-wooded garden by moonlight, and we cannot
but admire the taste of the Baron Stolmuyer in prefering it even to the
stately bed-chamber he had so recently left, and which, notwithstanding all
the advantages and beauties that art could bestow upon it, could never hope 
to
rival, or even to come near, the natural beauties of that highly-cultivated
piece of ground.

     And there are some flowers, too, that give out their sweetest odours to
the night air, and some again that unfold their choicest beauties only when
the sun has set, and the cold moonbeams can but look down upon them.

     When he got fairly into the garden, he found that there was a light,
gentle breeze playing among the shorter shrubs and flowers, but that it
reached not high enough to stir the leaves of the trees; but it is extremely
doubtful if, completely taken up as this man was, no doubt, with worldly
pursuits, he did not, after the first few moments, completely forget the 
world
of natural beauties by which he was surrounded.

     Folding his arms, he walked along the stately avenues with a solemn
tread, and then, soon banishing from his mind those feelings of melancholy
sadness which had oppressed him, he began evidently to indulge in dreams of
felicity which, by the manner in which he spoke of them, were evidently but
dreams.

     "What can I desire or want more than I have?" he said, "Immense wealth-
-
consequently, immense power.  Golden opinions may always be purchased with
gold, and what is there then really to hinder me pursuing to the full the
career which I have marked out to myself?  Surely I can surround myself with
all that is young, and delightful, and beautiful?  Can I not make these 
halls
echo with such laughter, that surely it must awaken, even in my breast, 
joyous
emotions?  Then there is the wine cup; why should not that flow with rich
abundance, gladdening the hearts of all, and adding even to genius, for the
time, a new fire, and a more delightful expression of its thoughts and
feelings?

     "And music, too: surely I can have abundance of music, to shed the
witchery of its charms about me; and, with these inducements and 
allurements,
I must and will succeed in banishing reflection, if I achieve no more."

     As he now stood, and turned his eyes towards the east, he fancied he 
saw
that the morning light was beginning faintly to show itself in the far off
horizon.

     "Another day is coming," he said, "and how much, how very much might be
done in a day.  I will, with the assistance of that man Leek, who, I can
readily perceive, is quite willing to bow down to any idol, provided it be 
of
gold, to commence the career of festivities that I have set my heart upon, 
and
we shall soon see how striking an alteration will take place in the halls of
Anderbury."

     He entered a small summer-house which was built in the garden, and
through the stained glass of which the moon shone with a variegated light, 
and
there he sat down, and, after a time, tasted of that repose which, upon the
bed of down that he had left, and surrounded by all the costly litter of his
handsome bedchamber he had courted in vain.

 Next Time: Mr. Leek Speculates Upon the Baron's Matrimonial Intentions.




                                 CHAPTER C.

MR. LEEK SPECULATES UPON THE BARON'S MATRIMONIAL INTENTIONS.

     
     Mr. Leek pondered deeply over what the baron had said to him regarding
his intention to take unto himself a wife, and viewed the resolution in all
its bearing, with a view of discovering in what way such a thing could be
turned to account, and whether that account might not be managed to his own
advantage, which was a matter than Mr. Leek very often considered of 
paramount
importance to himself, as being the pivot upon which things moved.

     In Mr. Leek was certainly centered all those notions which usually 
arise
from a desire to benefit onesself, and causing, as far as in him lay, all
events to circle around him when they least appeared to do so.

     "I must make this move of the baron's matrimonial alliance redound to 
my
own advantage in some way or other, though I cannot precisely say in what 
way;
but, if I have any hand in it, there must be a way, of that there can be no
doubt; the only thing is to discover the way."

     Mr. Leek set himself steadily to consider the subject in all its 
various
bearings, determined he would not give up the chase until he had discovered
what was to be done.

     "I have it -- I have it!" he muttered -- "I have it; who can suggest
anything better? I must have something to do in the suggestive style.  I 
will
persuade the baron to invite some one  with whom I can have a few words in
private.  I will have some few words in the way of a bargain with them.

     "Yes, yes; I will do my best to make somebody else's fortune; but at 
the
same time they must do something for me in return.  I must have a _quid_ for
my _quo_, as the parsons say.  They cannot preach the gospel without they 
have
a full stomach; for who can be pious and hungry at the same moment?  I 
can't,
my thoughts would be diverted; but the case holds good in every relation in
life; even though whom I would benefit must benefit me, else I lose the
natural desire I have to benefit them.  This reciprocity is the motto I like
to apply in cases of this kind, and very proper too."

     Thus did Mr. Leek argue the matter within his own mind, and then, 
having
thus made a resolution, his next step was to consider how he should put it 
in
practice -- how he should be able to realize his hopes, and give life and
being to the suggestions of his inventive faculties, which were usually of a
practical nature.

     "Well, well," he muttered.  "Let me see -- it's difficult to say who's
who now-a-days; but that must not cause me to lose a chance, and I think I 
can
make pretty sure of my bargain.  I think,  if I undertake anything, I can go
through it and not fail.  I will have so much of security as will prove a
bargain, and thus bring shame and disgrace upon them if they refuse to make
good the conditions."

     Thus Mr. Leek had an eye to the future, and the contingencies that 
might,
under different circumstances, arise by any possibility.

     Men like Mr. Leek do not often fail in their endeavours when they take 
a
comprehensive view of any affair in which they might engage, and thus, by
contemplating it in all its various phases, insure, as much as may be, 
success
to all their schemes.

     The next consideration that presented itself to Mr. Leek was the party. 
It was all very well to chalk out a plan of action -- the mode in which a
thing should be done; but it was another to adapt the tools to the occasion,
and make them subservient to the purpose he had in view.

     He did not choose his tools first, and then adapt his work; no, he saw
his object and adapted the means to the end; and, in considering this part 
of
the affair, he came to the following resolution.

     "I think I know who to pitch upon," muttered Mr. Leek to himself, in a
thoughtful tone.  "Aye, she has several children, and is a widow, too.  I 
know
she is comparatively poor, and not too much troubled with compunction, or 
any
absurd notions of delicacy upon this matter.  I can tell her what I mean
better than I could to a good many.  Yes, I will go and visit her.  I can 
come
to an understanding at once."

     This was satisfactory, and he arose to quit the house, and proceeded to
the residence of Mrs. Williams, the lady whose accommodating disposition, 
and
whose desire to see her daughters well provided for, would cause her to
bargain about matters that many would think too serious and too much a 
matter
of the affections to be permitted to be looked upon in the light of a mere
affair of pounds, shillings, and pence.

     Now, Mrs. Williams was a lady who possessed something very much like a
genteel independence, which is a very mysterious matter, and one which 
puzzled
many people to divine.  No one can understand what a genteel independence
means.

     It is one of those things that enables people to flit about, apparently
comfortable in circumstances, with genteel clothes, and fingers on which nor
marks of toil are observable, but which are white and soft, through often 
lean
attenuated, in consequence of privations.

     However, to return to Mrs. Williams.  She was a widow, had several
marriageable daughters, and was most anxious that they should be settled out
in life, so that she might be sure of their future welfare.  She was a
sharp-sighted, clever woman in some respects; and, in others, she was as 
women
usually are, which is not saying much.

     The house the widow occupied was on a pattern of neatness and 
gentility,
and ornamented with  woman's work from one end to the other; the ladies were
accomplished and well educated, and possessed of some personal charms; and
they were not altogether unacquainted with the fact.

     "Yes, yes," he muttered; "I will go to Mrs. Williams, and there we can
come to an immediate understanding.  Helen Williams will, I think, stand a
very good chance indeed.  I must go and have some conversation with her, and
learn her sentiments before I break ground with him; else she may try
something without my aid on her own account."

     This was a laudable object, and was but, as he said, merely putting
another person in the way of making a fortune, and putting something into 
his
own pocket at the same time; which was doing two good things at once,
charitable acts of the first class, because charity begins at home, and then
it gives to one's neighbours when we have a surplus.

     It did not take Mr. Leek very long to reach the widow's house; and it 
was
not without some degree of confidence that he rang the bell for admission;
and, when a servant appeared, he said, --

     "Is Mrs. Williams at home?"

     "Yes, sir, she is," answered the drudge; "do you want her?"

     "I wish to see her, else I should not have come here," replied Mr. 
Leek. 
"Tell her Mr. Leek desires to speak with her."

     "Very well, sir," said the girl, who left the hall, and then walked to
the parlour, in which Mrs. Williams was seated, and overheard all that was
said in the passage.

     "Mr. Leek, ma'am," said the girl.

     "Tell Mr. Leek to walk in," said the lady; and, in due form, Mr. Leek 
did
walk in, introduced by the servant, who soon departed, leaving the two
worthies in each other's presence.

     "Good morning, Mrs. Williams."

     "And good morning, Mr. Leek; this visit is unexpected, but valued.  I 
am
happy to see you.  Will you be seated?"

     "Thank you," said Leek, "I will.  Unexpected incidents give rise to 
other
unexpected incidents; so, you see, one event gives rise to another, and they
follow each other in rapid succession."

     "So they do," said Mrs. Williams.

     "Well," said Mr. Leek, as if greatly relieved in mind, giving sound to
something very much like a sigh, "and how so you find yourself this variable
weather -- eh, Mrs. Williams?"

     "As well as can be expected, you know, at my time of life."

     "Your time of life!  Upon my word, you are a young woman; and, if I 
might
hazard an opinion, one with no small share of charms; indeed, you are
decidedly a beautiful woman, Mrs. Williams."

     "Ah!  Mr. Leek, I though you were too much a man of business to be 
given
to flattery; but I am afraid of you."

     "There is no need, ma'am, I assure you.  But how are your lovely
daughters? -- in the enjoyment of good health and spirits?"

     "Yes, they are very well, I thank you, Mr. Leek -- very well indeed; 
they
usually are; they are considered to enjoy very good health."

     "That is a good thing, I am sure -- a very good thing, upon my word; 
they
usually are well?"

     "Yes; they have very little that ails them."

     "It will be a blessing to you when they are comfortably provisioned 
off,
under the protection of some one who will seek their future happiness as he
own," said Mr. Leek.

     "Why, as to that," said Mrs. Williams, "I am not so anxious as many 
might
be.  I love to see my children round about me; I love to be in their 
company,
and to know that no one can illuse them."

     "That is very true," said Mr. Leek.

     "And yet, I have, I must say, at times, a wish that I might, before I
die, see them comfortably settled in life, and their future happiness
secured."

     "Certainly; it is quite a mother's wish that it should be so; that her
children might enter the world, and that they might be provided for and
subject to none of the disagreeable contingencies of life."

     "Those are my feelings."

     "I thought as much, Mrs. Williams.  Have you heard of the Kershaws
lately?" inquired Mr. Leek.

     "Yes; I did hear there was a marriage in the family: pray is it true?"

     "It is."

     "A good marriage?"

     "Yes, I believe a very good marriage; one in which a great deal of 
money
is floating about from one to the other; indeed, I hear the gentleman is 
very
rich."

     "How did they become acquainted with such a man?  I did not think they
had any friends who could have brought them into contact with such a 
person."

     "A friend," said Leek.

     "Indeed!  Why, as I said, I did not know they possessed such friends; 
but
still, I suppose, there was some drawback -- either low-bred contracted
friendships, or some circumstances or other, that caused him to settle 
there."

     "I believe not," said Leek.

     "And what is he then?" inquired Mrs. Williams.

     "Why, he was a stronger in those parts; but he had an excellent 
fortune,
and was, according to all accounts, a very excellent match."

     "How came they to find him out? who introduced them to him? I should 
like
to know such a person."

     "Why, some friend."

     "How very disinterested of that friend," said Mrs. Williams.

     "Not quite.  It was a mutual understanding, I believe."

     "How?"

     "Why, thus; the friend wanted money, and the lady wanted a husband for
her daughter."

     "Well, I dare say she did, and I should have thought she was like to 
have
waited long enough."

     "And so she would; but an active man of business may have the means of
pushing a family's fortune, if they will but make it worth his while; it was
in this manner the Kershaws have made their fortune."

     "And what did they do?"

     "Why, they pushed a daughter into certain company into which she was
introduced by the man of business; not by himself, but he managed it so that
she was introduced, in a manner that made it appear as if they had no
connection, and then he could exert himself in another manner, and so
contrived to serve them by spreading favourable reports."

     "And that's how Mary Kershaw got her husband, is it?" inquired Mrs.
Williams, with a serious air.

     "Yes, it is, indeed."

     "How very immoral!"

     "Eh?"

     "How very immoral of a mother speculating in matrimonial matters for 
her
daughter. How could she expect that she could procure happiness for her, 
when
she uses such means?"

     "What better could she use?  You mistake the motive of the affair
altogether, Mrs. Williams; give me leave to say you do."

     "Indeed."

     "Yes, decidedly.  Thus, you don't attempt to buy a daughter's 
happiness;
you only pay an agent; that is all.  But it can be no crime that that agent 
is
engaged upon matters connected with the happiness of your daughter, which is
the great object of a mother's care."

     "Certainly -- certainly; how plain all that is," said Mrs. Williams;
"but I can't think it is exactly what I should do myself."

     "Perhaps not.  But I have exactly such a chance, at this very moment."

     "You, Mr. Leek?"

     "Yes, I.  I have the means, I believe, of obtaining a good fortune for
the daughter of a very respectable person, of the first respectability, and
with natural advantages in her favour.  Such a one, if it were worth my 
while
to lose time in carrying  such an affair -- "

     "Why, then, the matter looks a little different to what it did, and
certainly who could object to do what was just and right?"

     "Exactly.  Now, if you were desirous of seeing your daughter Helen, for
instance, comfortably provided for, what would you give -- making it a
suppositious case -- what would you give to see your daughter happy and
comfortable for life, with a good home over her head?"

     "A good deal."

     "What?"

     "I cannot say; but, of course, that would depend much upon the value of
such a prize; but I would not hesitate at a trifle in such a matter as that,
come what may."

     "Well -- well, that is really the best way to consider the affair in 
all
its various branches; you become more satisfied in the end.  Now, do you
really think you would be able to tolerate such an attempt to benefit
yourself and daughter?"

     "I do."

     "Will you enter into particulars?"

     "Yes, Mr. Leek; whenever you please.  I am willing to attend to your
proposal, and will be bound to anything I may say; for, in matters of this
kind, I must consider anything one may say or undertake, as a debt of 
honour."

     "Exactly.  But what we agree to now we must put in black and white,
because, by-and-bye, we may not think of it so well as we should when we see
it drawn up before one."

     "Agreed.  But what of this person?"

     "Why, I think, if we were to agree, you would find this gentleman very
rich and munificent, and living in a princely style; he is, in fact, a man 
of
rank -- of title, in fact."

     "Is that so?"

     "Yes, it is, I assure you, because I know him, and have had business
matters to do with him; and, though a correct man, he is not at all nice 
about
matters in which money is the chief ingredient.  He pays eight hundred a 
year
for rent, so you may guess he is not at all unlikely to give your daughter a
handsome settlement."

     "If he will have her."

     "Exactly; if he have her; there is the contingency, of course, which,
however, cannot affect you."

     "Yes, it must, since my daughter does not obtain her husband."

     "And you pay no money.  If the benefit is contingent to you, it is to 
me
also.  I do not wish to bind you to anything that will cause you to be a 
loser
under any circumstances."

     "Very well," said Mrs. Williams.  "Say what you please; there is pen,
ink, and paper; make it out, and I will sign any memorandum you may please,
provided it be of the complexion you have mentioned."

     "I wish for no other."

     Mr. Leek, accordingly, sat down near a table, and produced an 
agreement,
which was, to give him a certain sum of money, provided Helen Williams was
married to the baron.

     "And who is he, my dear Mr. Leek?" said the lady.

     "There," said Leek, "read that, and you will see his name."

     And, as he spoke, he pushed the memorandum towards her, and she took it
up and read it carefully over, and when she had so done, she signed it, and
returned it, saying, --

     "So he is a baron."

     "Yes; I told you he was a man of rank and title."

     "You did; and where will he live?"

     "At Anderbury House."

     "A fine place; I know it.  A splendid and princely place it is, too.  
He
must have a large fortune there.  It will be a splendid match for Helen.  I
wonder if there be any prospect of success; it appears almost too great a
catch."

     "I should say there was every prospect of success."

     "But we must not let Helen know anything of our compact.  I know her
feelings so well, that I am fully persuaded that she would not acquiesce in
the arrangement at all."

     "Certainly; it may for ever remain our own secret, with which no human
being need be acquainted."

     "That is precisely what I wish; but now how are we to manage the
introduction?"

     "That will be easy enough."

     "I am glad of it; but how is it to be managed at all?"

     "Thus:  the baron will give grand entertainments, and as he knows I am
very well acquainted with the generality of the gentry about, he has asked 
me
to point out those whom he might safely invite to his splendid banquets."

     "Then you will have the kindness to invite us," said Mrs. Williams.  "I
see through it now.  Ay, a very good plan.  Then you can say everything that
is necessary."

     "To be sure I can, and will," said Leek.

     "Well, I am glad you have called about this to-day, for we have had 
some
little scheme in view, but unknown to the principal party concerned; 
however,
as this one is in view, I shall prosecute no other."

     "It would be dangerous to attempt two such speculations at once, else 
he
would be unlikely to fulfil a promise even after he had gone some way 
towards
doing so."

     "I would run no risk in landing such a prize," said Mrs. Williams, who
began to have a keen relish for the chance they had in view, such as they 
had
not yet heard of from any quarter.

     "Then I may fully rely upon your putting Helen forward upon every
occasion that may present itself?"

     "You may."

     "And in the meantime keep as much to yourself as you can.  You must
profess to be unbounded in your admiration for all he says or does, and then
you will obtain a preference for companionship, and every little is an aid 
in
such matters."

     "I shall be careful."

     "And in the meantime I will bid you good day," said Mr. Leek.

 Next Time:  The Grand Entertainment Given by the Baron at Anderbury House,
 and His Announcement.




                                 CHAPTER CI.

THE GRAND ENTERTAINMENT GIVEN BY THE BARON AT ANDERBURY HOUSE, AND HIS
ANNOUNCEMENT.


     The baron made quick work of it, for in five days after the one on 
which
he took Anderbury House, he gave his first entertainment.  Money works
wonders, and in the baron's hands it seemed to have lost none of its magical
power; for Anderbury House in that time was furnished like a palace; rich 
and
costly were the decorations -- the ornamental parts were bold and florid.

     The house and grounds were of a most magnificent character, though they
had been viewed as separate features; but when considered as one, as that
which was part and parcel of one great whole, it was truly princely.

     Great care, labour, and expense had been exerted to make the mansion 
one
befitting the habitation of a prince; and the baron himself was looked upon
as little less than a prince; his disregard of money, his liberality, all
concurred in making him looked upon as one of the most popular men in that
neighbourhood.

     Indeed, none such as he had ever been seen or heard of in that quarter. 
He was safe to be considered as one of the grandees of the day.

     Anderbury House was now a theme of conversation with every one in the
whole town.  His magnificence, liberality, and all things connected with 
him,
were all well calculated to cause a feeling of prejudice to be made in his
favour.

     When people saw the men that were at work, the loads of articles which
were sent there, they were amazed, and could hardly credit their senses. 
Then
they all considered how very rich he must be to be able to spend so much in
furniture, in hangings, in beautifying, and in ornamental work, which must
have been very heavy.

     The baron was fully determined to do all he had intended to do in the
way of opening his first grand entertainment with great eclat, and in a
manner that would take the whole country by surprise.

     The day came; the house was furnished, decorated, filled with servants,
and everything that could make it appear as though it had been for years in
that state.

     It is surprising how soon a place can be made to lose all signs of its
ever having been uninhabited, and the fact of human beings being in a place
soon wears away the look of desolation by which it is otherwise enveloped; 
but
how much easier must it have been, with ample means, for a man like the 
baron
to cause such a house as that of Anderbury House to become what it was.

     The great wonder being, not what was done with ample means, but the 
short
time in which it had all been collected together, which was done with such
celerity and such small signs of bustle and disturbance, that it appeared as
if performed by the wand of a magician, so sudden and so quiet was it done,
comparatively.

     At the end of five days there was a number of invitations fairly 
written
out and directed, by order of the baron, to the principal inhabitants and
gentry of the place to visit Anderbury House, and partake of a grand banquet
given by the baron to them and his friends on that occasion.

     The day was named, and the information supplied by Mr. Leek to the 
baron,
was of a character that to that individual was extremely valuable, and of
which he freely availed himself.

     It must not be imagined that the worthy Mr. Leek was in any way 
oblivious
of the promise or obligation into which he had entered with Mrs. Williams,
whose name he had taken very great care to insert in the list of invitations
that the baron had sent out.

     The evening arrived, and the carriages drove up to Anderbury House in
rapid succession.  There were few or none who knew the baron; they were all,
however, anxious, most anxious to see who and what the baron was, who 
occupied
the estate.

     The title and name sounded well, and that was what dwelt upon people's
minds, and made an impression upon them, and they freely accepted the
invitations, especially when they inquired among themselves what was the
extent of invitations that had been issued, and they were confined wholly to
the _elite_ of the place.

     What was thought or said upon the occasion, it would be difficult to 
say,
because it was so various, and there were none who could in any way form an
opinion at all, that wore any appearance of probability about it.

     But there was a rumour spread about that he was a foreigner who had
immense riches, desirous of marrying an Englishwoman, and yet unable to 
obtain
introductions in the usual way, or else he was merely acting in accordance
with the customs and habits of his own country.

     The carriage drive of Anderbury House was completely occupied by the
strings of carriages that had taken up and set down for two hours or more, 
as
rapidly as they could.

     The fine apartments that Anderbury House contained, that were destined 
to
be used for the occasion, were indeed a splendid suit of rooms; but they 
were
now lit up with chandeliers, and adorned with glasses, and mirrors, and
pictures.

     As for the ornamental part of the mansion, it was superb.  Nothing had
been spared in expense, and by the way in which that was laid out, it was
evident the baron was a man of taste and judgment, and had converted a
nobleman's residence into a palace.

                            *     *     *     *

     The gentry came dashing up to the door.  The place was crowded, and 
many
were announced, and met and welcomed by the baron, who gave them a cordial 
and
distinguished greeting.

     There were many persons present; there were astonished at the display 
of
magnificence and wealth of the baron; they were delighted by his reception 
of
them -- his conversation, and general manners; and many, too, were much
astonished by the splendid entertainment which he had provided for them.

     All that art or the season could produce was there -- superb wines and
liqueurs -- fruits -- to an extent they had never before contemplated or
thought of.

     Anderbury House was without a rival.

     The wines were good, and they warmed the blood; and courtesies and
civilities of life were by the aid of the alchemy of old port, splendid and
sparkling champagne, sherries, Burgundies, and other wines, soon turned into
friendships and cordialities.

     "Baron," said one of the guests, "you have a superb place, and you
certainly are the proper individual to own such a place."

     "And why, my dear sir?" inquired the baron, blandly.

     "Because you have the taste and heart to decorate and array the place 
in
a manner befitting its extent, and you have the hospitality of one of the
ancients of the east."

     "Ha! Ha! very good, my dear sir.  You are kind, very kind; but I must
admit I do like to see neighbours act honestly, and in good faith with each
other; besides, I am of opinion that man is a social animal, and one who 
lives
only in society.  I cannot be a hermit."

     "Right.  If the world were all of your opinion -- and I believe they 
are,
practice only is opposed -- what a state of kindliness and comfort we should
all be in -- I am sure of it."

     "Ay, so am I.  Do you like music?"

     "I do," was the answer.

     "Then you shall hear some.  We shall have the dance presently, and then
there will be no heart that will not beat in unison with the harmonious
strain."

     "I think they deserve not to be here in the centre of happiness, if 
they
did not."

     "Ho! music, there!" said the baron, as he stamped on the floor of the
grand saloon, in which several hundred guests stood.

     The call was answered by a loud crash of instrumental music, that came
suddenly and startlingly upon the ears of the guests; but then it was 
followed
by a lighter strain, with a pretty but marked melody, such a one, that it
instantly communicated to those present, the feeling of being participators,
and even actors, in the scene that was about to be enacted upon the floor.

     It required but very little exertion to form the dance, where every one
was willing and anxious to take their places.  There was a slight degree of
excitement in the procuring of partners.

     Here for a moment the baron was at fault; but, by some means that were
not at that moment explained, or even thought of, Mrs. Williams led the
beautiful Helen past the spot at the moment.  He had spoken to her before, 
and
was well pleased with her.  He perceived she was beautiful and amiable. Her
mother, too, was with her, and in another moment the baron stepped forward,
saying, --

     "Madam, if the hand of your daughter is not already engaged, I beg
respectfully to claim it for the opening dance?"

     Mrs. Williams curseyed with condescension, saying, in reply, --

     "Yes, my lord.  My daughter is disengaged."

     "Miss Williams," said the baron, with much deference, "may I request 
the
honour of your hand?"

     Helen Williams curseyed, and said she was not engaged, and accepted of
his offer with a smile, but with some diffidence.

     The baron immediately led her to the top of the room, where, by this
time, there was a perfect lane for them to pass through, until they reached
the top.

     All had taken their places by an instinctive sort of feeling that was
almost universal in the ball-room.

     The signal was given, and then the baron led Helen down the first 
dance,
amidst the admiration of all, and the envy of not a few. The giddy whirl of
the dance, the throng of beauty, and the sweet but gay notes of the bands,
added to the _coup-d'oeil_ of the scene -- a scene of so much happiness and
gaiety, that there were few who could have looked coldly upon it.

     The baron, himself, appeared in the highest spirits, and with the
greatest hospitality he sought to administer to the wants of his guests, 
every
moment that he could abstract from the present leadership of the dance.

     He first visited one, and then the other, until he had made a fair 
round,
and then he found that the night was far advanced, and that, in but a short
time, he was convinced that daylight would come.

     The guests were well pleased with the splendour of the entertainment, 
and
the profusion that was there.  Nothing was wanting.  All were well pleased
with the arrangements.  Great care and great expense had been gone to to
gratify and pleasure them, and it had succeeded indeed; if it had not, they
would have been captious and ungrateful to an extreme.

     The guests, however well pleased with their entertainment, were still
unable to bear up against the excitement and fatigue of pleasure for hours,
and the animal power fails.

     Indeed, there is no one sense which may not be exhausted by an
overindulgence; even hearing will, as soon as any other, become invariably
tired by listening too long to music; ay, and even become unable to
distinguish between the different melodies; and the guests began to flag, 
and
to pay more attention to the side tables, and then to look drowsy, and some
few of the younger spirits appeared to have the dance to themselves.

     The baron now saw the proper moment had arrived for dismissing the
company; and, causing the music to cease, he advanced to the middle of the
room, and, waving his hand, said, --

     "My honoured guests, the sun begins to peep over the hills, and the
bright car of Phoebus rapidly ascends the skies, telling us that another day
has begun.  The happiest mortals must part, and so must we.  Let me thank 
you
all for this kindness, for thus honouring my banquet with your presence, and
let me hope it may often be thus.

     "Often, I say.  Yes, fair ladies, your presence will always be a
distinguished honour.  While I am a bachelor, I shall continue these _fetes_
once a fortnight regularly, until somebody takes the arrangement of such
matters out of my hands, by legally assuming the title of baroness."

     There was a long pause after this announcement, and then a sudden buzz 
of
admiration, which was heard on all sides; and the ladies looked at each 
other,
the baron, and the magnificent place they were in.  We cannot tell what 
passed
in their minds, but a shrewd guess might readily be formed, and to the
performance of that task we leave the reader.  There were many courtesies
before the separation was effected, and an hour had passed before the Baron
Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh found himself alone.

  Next Time:  The Wedding Feast -- The Admiral's Disappointment.




                                CHAPTER CII.

THE WEDDING FEAST. -- THE ADMIRAL'S DISAPPOINTMENT.


     And now the day arrived, at length, when Charles Holland was to call
Flora Bannerworth his bride.

     On this most auspicious event, as may be well imagined, the admiral was
in his glory, and he declared his intention of dancing, if any very handsome
young lady should ask him to be her partner at the ball, but not otherwise;
for it had been agreed to have a ball in the evening.

     Jack Pringle, too, was restored completely to favour upon the occasion;
indeed, as far as the admiral was concerned, he seemed to have granted a
general amnesty to all offenders, because he was heard to say, --

     "Well, I really should not mind if any poor devil of a Frenchman was to
come; he should know that good eating and drinking was for once in his life;
or even that vagabond, old Varney, the vampyre.  What a fool he was to take
himself off before the wedding, to be sure."

     Henry Bannerworth had undertaken to take off the old man's hand all the
trouble connected with the actual ceremony.  That is to say, letting the
clergyman know, and so on; therefore he, the admiral, had nothing at all 
upon
his mind but the festivities that were to be gone into upon the occasion.

     The numerous guests recommended by the lawyer were invited to a
breakfast, which was to be at one o'clock ; while a favoured few, which,
together with the family party, made up, altogether, about eighteen persons,
were to come to the wedding itself, and to be actually present at the
ceremony.

     The admiral was rather annoyed at Jack Pringle, about ten o'clock,
looking very anxiously at the sky, and shaking his head in a manner which
seemed to indicate that he had something of importance on his mind.

     "What the deuce is in the wind, now?" said the admiral. "You are always
looking for foul weather, you are, and be hanged you!"

     "Oh!" said Jack, "I was only a considering what they calls the blessed
aspect of the sky, and it seems to me there is a sort of kind of look about
things as says that there won't be no marriage at all to-day."

     "No marriage!"

     "No, not a bit of it; I'm tolerably sure there won't.  I was a going on
one of my numerous occasions to be married, and there was just that there 
kind
of look in the sky, and I wasn't."

     "What kind of look, you lubber?  I rather think, after living afloat a
matter of forty years and more, I ought to know the looks of the sky rather,
and I don't see any thing unusual in it."

     "Don't you?  Then I does; and there won't be no marriage."

     "Why you infernal croaking swab, you are drunk or out of your senses, 
one
of the two.  I would bet my head to a bottle of rum, that there will be a
marriage."

     "I don't mind," said Jack, "betting one bottle to twenty that there
won't."

     "Done, then -- done; and, Jack, for once in a way, you will find 
yourself
regularly done, I can tell you.  I know you have got some crotchet or 
another
in your head, by which you think you will get the better of the old man; but
it won't do: for I won't stand any quibbling or lawyer-like sneaking out of
it."

     "Oh! I won't sneak out of it, you shall see.  It shall be all plain
sailing and above board, I can tell you, admiral."

     The old man rather puzzled himself to think what Jack could mean; but
after a time he gave it up, and forgot it; for his mind began to be too
actively engaged upon what was going on to pay much attention to what he
considered was some joke of Jack's, which would turn out to be a mere 
quibble
of words after all.

     The admiral was right when he said there was no appearance of anything 
in
the weather to indicate that any stop would be put to the festivity on that
account; for a more pleasant, and a more genial, delightful day for the
occasion never shone out of the heavens.

     Indeed, if anything could have been considered as a gratifying omen of
the future felicity which Charles Holland was likely to enjoy in the society
of Flora Bannerworth, it was the aspect of that day -- a day so replete with
beauties that, had it been picked out specially for that occasion, it could
not have been more gratifying or delightful.

     The house was a large and a handsome one which the admiral had taken,
and, since, of course, he considered it to be his own, he was from an early
hour in the morning in a perpetual fidget, and here, and there, and
everywhere, for the purpose of seeing that all the arrangements were 
complete
for the day's proceedings.

     As may be well supposed, he was a great hindrance to everybody, and 
most
especially the servants, whom he had temporarily engaged, wished him at the
very devil for his interference.

     But, however, notwithstanding all these drawbacks, by ten o'clock
everything was in a tolerable state of readiness; and then the admiral
vociferously congratulated the first of the guests who arrived, for that was 
a
great merit in the old man's eyes, and, although he did not know the person 
a
bit, he almost terrified him by the cordiality of his greeting.

     "That's right," he said; "take old Time by the forelock, and always be
too soon instead of too late.  I'll tell you some capital stories some of
these days about the advantage of being a little too soon -- But, hilloa! 
here
comes somebody else.  Egad! we shall have them all here soon.  Here, Jack
Pringle!  where are you?"

     "Here!" cried Jack; "hard on to your larboard bow."

     "Pipe all hands among the flunkies!"

     "Aye, aye, sir," said Jack.

     Producing then a boatswain's whistle, he blew a shrill call, which
pleased the admiral, for, as he said, that was the proper way to begin
anything like an entertainment.

     People know they must be punctual at weddings, and generally are
tolerably so, with the exception of those persons who are never punctual at
anything; so that, in a short time, nearly the whole of those who had been
invited to be present at the ceremony had arrived, and the hour was fast
getting on towards that when the marriage was to take place.

     The admiral would have been blind, indeed, if he had not perceived that
there was a great deal of whispering going on among the Bannerworth family,
and he got rather indignant and a little uneasy to know what it could all be
about; but, most of all, he began to be annoyed at Jack Pringle, for that
individual's conduct was certainly of a peculiar and extraordinary 
character.

     Every now and then he would burst out into such an amazing roar of
laughter, apparently at nothing, that it became seriously annoying to the 
old
man; and, finally, taking up a pair of nut-crackers that were upon the 
table,
he gave Jack a hard rap upon the top of the head, as he said, --

     "Are you out of your senses? what are you going on about?"

     "Oh, nothing," said Jack; "I was only a thinking.  Don't you recollect
our wager?"

     "Yes, I do; you have laid me one bottle of rum to twenty that Charles 
and
Flora won't be married today."

     "Very good," said Jack, "that's quite correct, and mind, I hold you to
it."

     "Hold me to it -- I'll hold you to it.  I know  well enough it's some
stupid joke you have got hold of."

     "Very good," said Jack; "we shall see."

     The time crept on, and half-past eleven o'clock came, and the guests 
were
assembled in the drawing-room, where, by a special licence, the ceremony was
to have been performed; and on the mantle-shelf of which there was a time-
piece, indicating the rapid arrival of the hour named for the ceremony.

     "You know, Henry," said the admiral, "I left everything to you.  I hope
it's all correct, now, and that you have not made any blunders."

     "None whatever, I assure you, admiral.  I have arranged everything; but
Flora has just told me that she wants to speak to you."

     "Speak to me! then why the deuce doesn't she speak?  I suppose she can
speak to me without asking your leave?"

     "Admiral," said Flora, "I am extremely anxious to ask you if you will
forgive me for something which may possibly annoy you a little, and which
certainly I feel myself answerable for."

     "What is it?"

     "You must promise to forgive me first."

     "Well, well, of course -- of course I do; what is it?"

     "Then, I must say, I would rather not be married to-day."

     "What!" cried the admiral.

     "I told you so," shouted Jack.  "I saw it in the look of the clouds 
this
morning.  I never knew anybody get married when there was a light breeze
blowing from the nor'-east."

     "You be quiet," said the admiral; "I'll be the death of you, presently.
What is the meaning of this, Flora?  Is it not rather a cruel jest to say 
such
a thing to me now?"

     "It is no jest, sir, but a fact; I must beg to be excused."

     "And I, uncle," said Charles Holland, advancing, "am of the same mind;
and I join with Flora in begging that you will look over the little
disappointment this may occasion you."

     "Little disappointment!" cried the admiral; "am I awake -- am I out of 
my
senses?  Jack, you rascal, where am I?"

     "Can't say," cried Jack; "but I think as how you are abut two points to
the south'ard."

     "Flora, speak again.  You do not, cannot mean to tell me that any 
foolish
quarrel has interfered to prevent this union, upon which I have set my 
heart? 
If you are not jesting, there must be some very special reason for this
alteration of intention."

     "There is," said Flora, as she looked the old man kindly in the face;
"there is a very special reason, sir, and one which I will mention to you at
once; a reason which makes it next to impossible that the ceremony should
proceed.  The real fact is --"

     "Well, go on -- go on."

     "That Charles and I were married a fortnight ago."

     "D--n me," said the admiral, "if ever I was so taken in my life.  A
fortnight ago! shiver my timbers -- "

     "Go on, old pepper-castor," said Jack; "only remember you owe me twenty
bottles of rum."

     "I won't look over it," said the admiral; "I won't and I can't; it's
treating me ill, Flora -- I tell you, it is treating me ill."

     "But you know you have looked over it, admiral," said Flora, "and I 
have
your positive promise to forgive me."

     "Besides," said Jack, "she won't do so no more; and, as far as I sees 
of
these ere things, it's a deuced good thing as we ain't bothered with any
parson coming here this morning, casting up his eyes like a dying dolphin if
you outs with so much as a natural d--n or two.  I can't stand such rubbish,
not I; and its my out and out opinion that we shall be all the merrier; and 
as
for the old man -- "

     Jack's oratory was put a stop to by the admiral seizing a piece of
confectionary that was upon the table, and throwing it with such a dab in 
his
face that he was half choked and covered with currant jam; and he made such 
a
spluttering that the guests could keep their countenances no longer, but 
burst
into a roar of laughter consequent upon that proceeding.

     "And you, too, Henry," said the admiral, "I suppose you were in the
plot?"

     "Why yes," said Henry, "I rather think I was.  The fact is, that Flora
disliked the public marriage, although she looked forward with pleasure to 
the
meeting with this pleasant party on the present occasion; so, among us, we 
all
cast about for some means for securing the agreeable without the 
disagreeable,
and so, a fortnight ago, they were married quietly and privately, and I 
plead
guilty."

     "I thought as much," said the admiral, "I'll be hanged if I didn't; but
now just answer me one question, Charles."

     "A hundred, if you please, uncle."

     "No, one will suffice.  I want to know whether you were married in the
name of Bell, or in the name of Holland?"

     "I took legal advice, uncle, as to the validity of my marriage in the
name of Bell; and as I found that a man's marriage was quite legal, let him
call himself whatever he pleases, and as I knew that it was your wish I 
should
take the name of Bell, I was married in that name, and Flora now calls 
herself
Mrs. Bell."

     "Then I'll say no more about it," said the admiral, "but let it pass so
-- let's be as merry as possible; and first of all, we will have a bumper 
all
round to the bride."

     This affair, upon which Charles really had had some misgivings, being
thus agreeably settled, there was certainly nothing to interfere with the
hilarity of the meeting, and as there was an abundance of good cheer, and 
the
guests had been selected judiciously, and were persons who could and would
enjoy themselves, an extremely pleasant day was passed.

     For about an hour, perhaps, only the admiral now and then exhibited 
some
symptoms of indignation, and shook his head occasionally at Flora; but a 
smile
from her soon restored him, and he did actually contrive to get through a
quadrille in some extraordinary manner, by almost knocking every lady down,
and ending by falling sprawling himself.

     The only great interruption -- and that lasted for nearly half an hour 
--
to the proceedings arose from that incorrigible Jack Pringle, who, as usual,
did not get a glass too much, but a whole bottle too much; and then an 
obscure
idea seized him that it was absolutely impossible for him to avoid kissing 
all
the ladies, as it was a wedding, or ought to have been a wedding.

     Blaming himself, therefore, very much for not having thought of it
before, he made a wild rush into the drawing-room, and commenced operations.

     A scene of confusion ensued which quite baffles description, and Jack 
had
to be carried out at last by main force, thinking himself a very ill used
person, when he was only doing what was right and proper.

     The admiral apologized to the ladies for Jack, calling their attention 
to
the fact that he wasn't such a fool as he looked, and that, after all, it
wasn't a bad notion of Jack's, only that he had not set about it in the 
right
way.

     "Howsomedever," said the admiral, "I don't mind showing you how he 
ought
to have done it."

     This, however, was universally declined, and that with so much 
decision,
too, that the admiral was forced to forego the generous intention; but long
before the parties separated for the night, he admitted that it was just as
well the marriage business had been all settled before; and it was shrewdly
suspected that, from the fact of the admiral singing "Rule Britannia," after
he had gone to bed, he had just slightly exceeded the bounds of that
moderation which he was always preaching to Jack.

 Next Time:  Dr. Chillingworth Makes Urgent Inquiries for the Vampyre; and 
the
 Lawyer Gives Some Advice Concerning the Quaker.




                                CHAPTER CIII.

DR. CHILLINGWORTH MAKES URGENT INQUIRIES FOR THE VAMPYRE; AND THE LAWYER 
GIVES
SOME ADVICE CONCERNING THE QUAKER.


     If the Bannerworth family and the admiral were inclined to put up 
quietly
with the loss of the large sum of money which Dr. Chillingworth fully 
believed
that Varney, the vampyre, had gone off with, he could not fully divest 
himself
of the idea that it was recoverable.

     When he went home, he succeeded in silencing the clamours of his wife, 
by
assuring her that his practice for half-a-dozen years would not at all be
equal to what he should gain if he could successfully carry out what he was
aiming at; and as everything, to Mrs. Chillingworth, resolved itself into a
question of pounds shillings, and pence, she was tolerable well satisfied, 
and
consented to remain quiet, more especially as he gave her sufficient to keep
the household comfortably for some time while again left home.

     So thoroughly had he made up his mind not to let the matter rest, that 
he
carefully resolved the best means of setting about, systematically, to 
inquire
for Varney.

     He thought it impossible that he could have left the cottage home of 
the
Bannerworths with such great secrecy that no one had observed him.

     He was too remarkable a man, too, in personal appearance to escape
notice; and if any one saw him, with a grain of curiosity in their
composition, they would be sure to look after him with speculative eyes as 
to
who and what he was.

     The cottage had not many dwellings near it, and the doctor thought it
highly possible that if he visited them all, and made proper inquiries, some
one among their inhabitants might be able to tell him that such a man as
Varney had been seen.

     Accordingly he commenced his tour, and, as luck would have it, at the
very second cottage he went to, a woman stated that a tall, dark,
singular-looking man had asked leave to sit down for a few minutes, and to 
be
accommodated with a glass of water.

     "Had he any parcel or bundle with him?" asked Mr. Chillingworth.

     "No," was the reply; "he certainly had nothing of the kind that I could
see, and only seemed very weary and exhausted indeed."

     "Do you know which direction he went in?"

     "I watched him from my cottage door, and after looking about him for 
some
few minutes, he walked away slowly in the direction of the London road."

     This was all the information that Dr. Chillingworth could obtain in 
that
quarter; but it strengthened him in his own opinion, that Varney had left 
that
part of the country, and proceeded to London; but with what motives or
intentions could not be guessed even, although probably it was with an
intention of finding a wider sphere of action.

     "If," thought the doctor, "he has gone on the London road, and walked, 
he
must have stopped, in the very weak state that he was, within a very few 
miles
for rest and refreshment; in which case I shall hear tidings of him, if I 
take
myself the same path."

     He pursued this plan, and walked on, inquiring at the different inns 
that
he passed, but all in vain, for such a man.

     No one had seen anybody resembling Varney; and the doctor, with a sense
of great disappointment, was compelled, himself, to stop for rest at a
roadside inn, where the mails and stage coaches stopped to change horses.

     The landlord of the inn was a good-tempered, conversable man, and was
listening, with quiet complacency, to the rather long description of the
personal appearance of the individual he sought, that was given by Dr.
Chillingworth, when the mail coach from London, which was proceeding to a 
very
distant part of the country, stopped to change horses, and the coachman came
to the bar to take his usual glass of refreshment.

     While so engaged, he heard something of what Mr. Chillingworth was
saying, and he remarked to that gentleman, --

     "Do you mean, sir, a long fellow, that looked as if he had been buried 
a
month and dug up again?"

     "Well," said the doctor, "he certainly had something of that 
appearance;
but the man I am inquiring about disappeared last Thursday."

     "The very day, sir; I was going up with the mail, when he hailed it, 
and
got up on the outside.  It's the very man, you many depend; I remember well
enough his getting up, but somehow or another when we got to London he 
wasn't
to be found; and so he had his ride as far as it went, and I have not the
least idea of how far that was, for nothing."

     "I thank you for your information, and I have no doubt that it was the
man I seek for.  Although he had a large sum of money with him, I think, yet
it was not in an available shape to use, and I dare say he would not be very
scrupulous about the means he adopted to avoid the inconvenience of any
detention."

     "Not he, sir, he wasn't very particular.  I dare say he got down
somewhere in London, most probably at Piccadilly, where there is always a
crowd, and I draw up for about five minutes.  I don't look to see who gets
down, or who stays up, so, as regards that, he might take himself off easy
enough, if he liked."

     "But you missed him?"

     "Yes, I did, when it was too late.  Can you tell me who, or what he is,
sir?"

     "Yes," said Dr. Chillingworth; "it was Varney, the vampyre, of whom, no
doubt, you have all heard so much, and who has made such a commotion in the
countryside."

     "The deuce it was!" said the coachman; "and I have actually had one of
these creatures upon my coach, have I! I only wish I had known it, that's 
all;
I would have pretty soon got rid of such a customer, I can tell him. They
don't suit me, those sort of gentry; but I'm off, now; good day, sir. I hope
you may catch him."

     The coachman got upon his box, and drove away; and Dr. Chillingworth
began to think that unless he took a journey to London, which he was 
scarcely
prepared to do, he must give up, for a time, the pursuit of Varney.

     Besides, he thought, and justly enough too, that even if he went to the
metropolis in search of him, its extent would baffle all inquiry, and make 
it
almost impossible that it could be set about with any prospect of success; 
so
he resolved, before he went any further in the matter, to urge the admiral 
and
the Bannerworths once more upon the subject.

     He was firmly, himself, of opinion that something more, and that,
perhaps, too, of a very uncomfortable character regarding Varney, would soon
be heard, unless they could communicate to him in some manner, and persuade
him either to retire from England altogether, or to lead a quiet life with a
portion of the wealth he had acquired.

     It will be seen with what great pertinacity the doctor clung to that 
idea
which to the Bannerworths appeared such a very doubtful one, namely, that
Varney had really got possession of all the money which had been hidden by
Marmaduke Bannerworth; but we must leave the doctor for the present 
inactive,
because he felt that, at the period of Flora's marriage, they would be too
much occupied to give him the attention he required, and, therefore, he
determined to wait until that ceremony, at all events, was completely over.

     And now we may as well state at this juncture that the admiral was 
quite
as good as his word, as regarded taking the advice of his friend, the 
lawyer,
concerning the Quaker who still held possession of the Dearbrook estate.

     With all the indignation that he felt upon the matter, he laid it 
before
the man of law, explaining how liberally Henry had dealt with him, and what 
a
very uncourteous reception they had met with.

     "I am afraid," said the lawyer, "that he may keep you out of it for a
year or two, unless you compromise with him."

     "What do you mean by compromise?"

     "Just this; he knows very well, of course, that he cannot hold
possession, and he wants to be paid out, that's the whole of the affair.  He
considers that you may take friendly advice, and that then you will be told
how much shorter, cheaper, and less vexatious a course it is, to put up with
almost any amount of imposition, then to get involved in a law suit."

     "That's all very fine," said the admiral; "but do you think I'd let 
that
rascally Quaker have a farthing of my money?  No, indeed; I should think 
not. 
If he expects us to compromise he will be disappointed."

     "Well, then, if your determination is to proceed, I will, if you like,
take the necessary steps in the name or Mr. Henry Bannerworth.  Do you know 
if
he administered to his father's estate?"

     "No; I know very little about it.  But you had better see him."

     "Certainly," said the lawyer; "that will be the best plan. I had better
see him, as you say, and I dare say," added the lawyer to himself, "I shall
find him more reasonable that you are by a great deal."

     The lawyer did see Henry; for he called upon him and so strongly 
advised
him to compromise the matter with the Quaker, that Henry gave him full
instructions to do as he pleased.

     "Your title is so clear," said the lawyer, "that it cannot prejudice 
you
to make the offer, or, rather, to allow me to make it for you; besides, I 
will
take care it shall be made without prejudice, and I dare say you will get
possession pretty quickly of the Dearbrook estate."

     The lawyer wrote to the Quaker, asking for the name of some solicitor 
who
would act in his behalf, and at once received an answer, referring him to a
Quaker attorney, who was tolerably notorious for sharp practice, and who was
about as great a rogue as could be found in a profession somewhat notorious
for such characters.

     The shortest plan and the best was that which was at once adopted by 
the
admiral's friend, the attorney; for he went to town and saw the Quaker upon
the subject.

     The result of their conference was, that Mr. Shepherd wanted a sum
equivalent to two years' rental of the premises he occupied, before giving 
up
possession of them; and in reply one year was offered, and there the matter
rested for mutual consideration of the principals.

     Henry did not feel exactly disposed to do anything in the affair, in
actual defiance of the admiral, so he resolved upon trying, at all events, 
to
persuade him into the compromise, if possible; and the principal argument he
intended using was, that Flora had heard sufficient of the Dearbrook 
property,
and that it would be a thousand pities, consequently, to keep her out of
possession of it, since, from what they had all seen of it, they felt that 
it
would be a very desirable residence indeed.

     The admiral's anger, however, had been so roused by the insolent 
conduct
of the Quaker, that it required great care and tact to introduce the subject
to him in such a shape, and Henry set about it not without some fear of the
result.

     "I have seen, admiral," he said, "your friend, the lawyer, about the
Dearbrook property, and we shall not have possession in our lifetimes."

     "What do you mean by that?"

     "Oh, our ghosts may perhaps haunt its verdant shades; but we shall be 
all
dead long before the Court of Chancery decides in our favour; for, owning to
the manner of my father's death, some difficulties may be thrown in the way 
to
protract time."

     "What! does he tell you so?"

     "Yes, indeed he does, admiral; and then, you see, Heaven knows how many
claimants may arise for the estate, if it was known how recently we came by
the title-deeds."

     "The deuce they would!  I can't say but there is some reason in that,
after all; but what is to be done?  You can't say that the Quaker, Shepherd,
is to be allowed to retain possession of the Dearbrook estate, just because
there are some difficulties in the way of getting it out of his clutches?"

     "Certainly not; but the whole question resolves itself into what is the
best means of accomplishing that object, and the great difficultly seems to 
be
this; that he actually has possession, which you have heard, of course, is
nine points of the law, and puts a man in such a position that he can give a
deal of trouble to any one who is not so fortunately situated."

     "Can he; then I tell you what I'll do, Henry; I'll pretty soon alter 
that
state of things."

     "But how can you, admiral?"

     "By going and taking possession, to be sure; and if possession be 
indeed
nine points of the law, I don't see why we shouldn't have them.  I have 
taken
a ship or two from an enemy when they have been under their own batteries, 
and
it ain't the most likely thing in the world that a Quaker, who, in the navy,
we call a wooden gun, should stop me taking possession of the house."

     "I am quite sure," said Henry, "that if you were to set about it, you
would do it, -- there can be no doubt whatever upon that head; but it's a 
very
difficult thing to treat the law in that sort of way, and you may depend 
there
would be an amazing fuss made about it, so much so, indeed, that some 
serious
consequences might ensue, and we should perhaps lose the estate altogether."

     "Hang the estate! it's the Quaker I want to serve out."

     "But you have served him out.  Don't you recollect the kick you gave
him?"

     "Why, yes; I certainly did give him a kick."

     "And a good one too."

     "You think it was a good one, do you, Henry?  Well, I must say, I am 
very
glad of that -- very glad of it.  It's some consolation, that's quite 
clear."

     "And I think then, after that, admiral -- after feeling that you have
served him out in that kind of manner, and that he  has put up with the
degradation of having been kicked by you, you might just as well forego a
little of your resentment, and allow me to ascertain if I cannot make
something like terms with him."

     "Terms with a vagabond like that!"

     "Yes.  What say you to giving him a trifle, and then let him go; 
provided
he clears out of the estate at once, and gives us no further trouble?"

     "I'd ten times rather kick him again."

     "Why, yes; and I must confess he deserves kicking most certainly.  I
admit all that, that a greater scamp you could not find; but, after all, you
see, admiral, it comes to a question of pounds, shillings, and pence. 
Nothing
in the world makes a man like that suffer but touching his pocket."

     "Very likely; but you propose to put something into his pocket."

     "Yes, at first; but it is to save the more, as would easily be found;
and, besides, you see how he has been afraid to take any notice of your
kicking him."

     "To be sure he has; such fellows are always afraid.  You didn't expect 
he
would take any notice, did you? and, if you did, I knew better.  Afraid,
indeed!  Ah! to be sure; that's just what he was likely to be -- afraid, as 
a
matter of course."

     "If you please, sir," said a servant, coming in to the admiral, "here 
is
a gentleman wants to speak to you."

     "To me?  Who the deuce can that be, I wonder?"

     "He says it's on particular business, sir."

     "Well, well; show him in here."

     A mere youth was shown into the apartment, who, addressing the admiral,
said,

     "Pray, sir, is your name Bell?"

     "To be sure it is; and what of that?"

     "Nothing particular, sir; only I have the honour of serving this upon
you."

     "And what the devil is it?"

     Before this question was well out of the admiral's lips the lad had
disappeared, and when the old man unfolded the paper, he found that it was a
notice of action from Shepherd, the Quaker, on account of the assault which
Admiral Bell had committed upon him.

     "And this is the fellow," cried the admiral, "that you want me to
compromise with.  No, Master Henry, that won't do; and, since he has had the
imprudence now to commence war with me, he shall not find that I am backward
in taking up the cudgels in my own defence, I'll pretty soon let him know 
that
he has got rather an obstinate foe to deal with, and we will see how long he
will find it worth his while to persevere."

     Henry felt at once that this imprudent act of the Quaker, which, no
doubt, was intended to hasten and facilitate a compromise, placed it further
off than ever, and that, in the admiral's present state of mind, it was 
quite
absurd to think of talking to him in anything like a peaceable strain, for
such could not be done.

     The utmost that could be hoped was that he would not actually give way 
to
some act of violence, and that he would, at all events, do nothing more than
what the law allowed him to do in the matter.

     This was what Henry did not feel quite sure of, and he only hoped it.

 Next Time:  The Bone-house of the Churchyard of Anderbury. -- The
 Resuscitation. -- The Fight, and the Escape of the Dead. -- The Boat, and 
the
 Vain Pursuit.




                                CHAPTER CIV.

THE BONE-HOUSE OF THE CHURCHYARD OF ANDERBURY. -- THE RESUSCITATION. -- THE
FIGHT, AND THE ESCAPE OF THE DEAD. -- THE BOAT, AND THE VAIN PURSUIT.


     The coroner, after the inquest was over, issued his precept for the
interment of the body of the man who was found in the ice-well of Anderbury
House, and whose body was deposited at the bone-house in Anderbury 
churchyard.

     There was an end now to these proceedings, though it was much too fresh
in people's minds to enable them to forget it; yet, once the coroner's 
inquiry
over, it usually happens that a feeling of satiety, arising from excitement,
in the first place, or following that excitement, and induced by the 
knowledge
that all is done that can be towards unravelling the mystery that had caused
such a sensation, takes place.

     The town of Anderbury was first subsiding to its original quietude, and
the only indication of any excitement was that among a few old topers, who 
met
in the early part of the evening, to discuss anything that there might be
stirring to talk about, and to do that required but little inducement, to 
talk
being their principal, not to say only, amusement; indeed, to have deprived
them of that would have been to have deprived them of nearly their only
inducement to work and to live, that they may indulge in their evening
conversations at the alehouse.

     There was a very general belief among such people that, as the whole
affair was unexplained, that it was mysterious, and the nods and winks were
numerous; indeed, it was thought that there was more than the usual amount 
of
mystery.  However, this has its limit, and when all is said that can be 
said,
there must be an end to the discussion, which is usually dropped for want of
fuel to feed it.

                  *            *            *            *

     That night the baron sat alone in his apartment, apparently buried in
deep thought; but, now and then, he might have been seen to lift up his eyes
towards the east, as if watching for something, and then he would cast them
towards a magnificent timepiece on the mantelpiece, and then he would again
relapse into thoughfulness.

     There were several such fits as these, that were broken in the same
manner as before, and, at length, the arose and took a small book off one of
the tables, and examined a certain page and a certain column, and then he
half-muttered to himself,

     "Yes-- yes; it is as I thought-- the moon will rise in about an hour 
and
a half; that will do.  I will now go to the bone-house, and there watch the
body, and ascertain if my fears are correct; if not, I shall be well repaid
for my trouble; and should they be, why, I must endeavour to make the affair
take the best turn I can.  I must try and prevent the completion of my own
deed from being disturbed in its integrity.  The dead must remain so; and, 
if
not, to that condition he must return, and lie where no moon's ray will 
reach
him."

     He arose, and, wrapping his cloak around him, went to the door of his
apartment, and paused, as if listening.

     "No one is stirring," he muttered; "no one is about."

     He stole softly out of the apartment, and descended the stairs, making
his way towards a small private door, which opened into the garden, which he
secured behind him.

     Then he walked rapidly but softly through the garden, which he quitted 
by
another private door, and which he also secured after him; and then 
proceeded
quickly and silently towards the church yard of Anderbury church, which was
but ill-qualified to keep intruders out of it, seeing that there was but a 
low
wall and a hedge for the purpose of a fence, which could at various places 
be
easily scaled; indeed, there are few country churchyards that cannot be so
entered; and it does not appear usually the practice to endeavour to keep 
out
human beings, but rather to keep the yard clear of all brute intruders, for 
it
was open to all who should choose to come.

     The scene was not very distinct; the moon was not yet risen, and 
darkness
reigned upon the earth; he could see but a short way, and he cared but 
little
for that.

     "If darkness prevents my seeing, it also prevents others seeing me;
therefore, it is welcome.  The moon will rise soon enough to aid me in my
watch, and if it rise not at all, it would be agreeably satifactory, seeing
that there would be no probability of what I suspect happening without her
rays."

     He hurried onwards towards the churchyard.  The sea was close by, and 
the
night breeze, as if swept across the face of the ocean, gave the indistinct
roar, which never ceases, but only increases and abates as a storm or calm
prevails at the time, and as the wind increases or diminishes, thus 
increasing
or diminishing the intensity of the roar; but it never entirely ceases at 
any
time.

     The baron made his way towards the churchyard by an unfrequented path
that was well know to him; but as he was about to get over a stile into a
field, he thought he heard a voice speaking on the other side of the hedge.

     He paused a moment, and crept along the hedge, until he came to the 
spot
where the voice seemed to come from, and then he paused, until he heard them
speak again.

     "I tell you what it is, Jack; it's a very strange affair-- a very 
strange
thing, indeed."

     "So it is."

     "And one I can't understand at all, though I have endeavoured to do all
I can that way.  I have thought the matter over very often; but it always
comes to this-- that it is a very strange affair."

     "What can be the cause of it?"

     "I don't know."

     "Have you seen it?"

     "I thought I did once," said the second; "but it was misty and dark; 
but
I think I couldn't be mistaken."

     "Nor I."

     "You have see it oftener than I; have you not?"

     "Yes-- yes-- I have, several times."

     "How did you see it?"

     "Why, thus: I was looking out for the lugger, and there away in the 
east
I saw something white coming across the sea.  It came very steady and slow,
and looked small at first."

     "Yes-- yes."

     "Well, then, after that it came closer and closer, until I saw it 
changed
its shape to a gigantic woman."

     "A woman!" exclaimed the other.

     "Yes, or may be a man in a winding-sheet; that is most likely though,
after all."

     "I think so, too," he replied; "as sure as there are dead bodies in
Anderbury churchyard, it forebodes some great evil-- of that I am very well
persuaded."

     "What great evil do you think will happen?"

     "How can I tell?  I am no prophet.  I cannot imagine in what shape it
should come; but come it will depend upon it; if it comes not now, when it
does come, remember my words."

     "I will."

     "And you will find them all true some day or other, if it don't come 
too
soon to be pleasant; but I think something may happen to the lugger."

     "She has not been seen these two days; and it is now past the time when
she ought to have been in.  Thus it was with the other lugger that the 
revenue
cutter took."

     "Did you see the apparition?"

     "No; but there was a token, I believe; but I was not in those parts at
that time."

     "Well; but how did it happen that they let the lugger be taken by the
king's men?"

     "Oh! they couldn't well help it, you may depend upon that.  She was
coming from Cherbourg, laden with brandy and with lace, a good cargo, and
worth something, I assure you."

     "She must have been worth something."

     "She was.  Well, she had a very good run for a part of the way, when a
fog came on.  Well, it wasn't well understand what they were to do.  Some 
were
for putting back; others for standing where they were, and some few for
running in shore.

     "I shall run in shore," said the captain.  "I know every hole upon the
coast; and I know the exact spot where we are, and how to steer.  I can run
the vessel to an inch."

     "And that inch may do the business for us all," said one of the crew;
"but I'm ready."

     "And I, too," said the captain; "and I will run her where there will be
no chance of any meeting with the preventive people; but the fact is, we can
neither see nor be seen; we are safe, boys.  A good run on shore, and a 
swift
voyage home."

     "Huzza!" shouted the men; and the vessel was run towards the shore, 
and,
at the same time, they were going under an easy sail safe and secure, and 
had
no thought of any evil.

     There was a look-out, at the same time we could not see two yards 
beyond
the vessel.  The watch was alert, but he could see nothing; but suddenly he
called out, --

     "Ship a-head!  Port your helm!"

     "What ship's that?" inquired a voice, and, in another moment, they 
found
themselves alongside the revenue cutter, from whom they had so long and so
often escaped.

     "Board!" shouted the officer on board, and then he called upon our 
people
to surrender; but the captain drew his sword, and called out to the crew to 
do
as he did, and defend the ship; and as he spoke, he cut one man down, but 
was
immediately met by a pistol-shot, which laid him dead on the deck.

     After that there was no resistance; the men didn't want to endanger 
their
lives by resisting men who were doing their duty, and protected by law; they
were, moreover, out-numbered by the revenue people, and if they resisted, 
they
would be liable to hanging, whereas they could but imprison them.

     "They were all taken, and they were all imprisoned for different 
crimes--
all, however, getting free after a term."

     "Did that ruin the owners?"

     "Oh! no; they calculated upon a loss now and then, and can well afford 
it
too."

     "Well, what do you think of the baron at Anderbury House?"

     "Think!  Why, think he's a trump.  What a glorious haul there would be
there, if we could get hold of it."

     "How do you mean?"

     "Why, the plate and other things that are valuable.  Look you now, if 
we
could load the lugger with the contents of the house, what would they not
fetch in Paris?"

     "We should not get it if we were to take it there."

     "We should obtain a heavier profit than ever we should under any other
circumstances; and I think it will be a very good plan, indeed, to take
Anderbury House by storm.  There's some thousands of pounds' worth of plate
and jewellery there."

     "So there is."

     "Well, what do you say to make the attempt?  Attempt, I say; but I 
shall
not call it an attempt, for there will be no attempt at resistance-- we 
shall
have only to walk in and frighten a few servants; there will be nothing but 
to
carry away what we can lay our hands on."

     "That will do-- anything that will pay."

     The baron had been an attentive listener.  He had, moreover, had some
thoughts in his own mind of jumping over the hedge, and seizing the two men;
but, upon second thoughts, he belived [sic] that this was the worst that 
could
be done.

     "I will frighten them, and thus prevent them from putting their designs
into practice to my damage."

     The baron silently collected several large stones and clods of earth 
into
one space, and then he peeped through the hedge.  He saw where they lay, and
took up two clods, pitched one on each of their heads, and then he said, 
when
they started up, --

     "Miserable sinners! the eye of Heaven is upon you; go your ways and
repent while there is time."

     The men were for a moment horrified, and stood still, chained to the
spot; but suddenly they were released, and in a moment they rushed from the
spot with the fleetness of deer.

     The baron watched them out of sight, and then he muttered to himself, -
-

     "'Tis well; they are now out of sight; they are gone, and they will 
make
no attempt upon Anderbury House, I'll warrant them they think their design
will be penetrated by others, and they will suffer for it should they 
attempt
it.  I trust I can make a very good resistance; however, it is worth 
thinking
off."

     He paused a few moments longer, and then turned towards the churchyard.

     He pursued his way, however, thoughtfully; every now and then, however,
he looked around to ascertain if any one were present, but he was satisfied
there was none, and thus he was quite and entirely alone in his walk.

     There was now light enough to enable him to distinguish objects at a
short distance, and he quickened his pace, as he thought of the moon's 
rising;
but a few minutes brought him into view of the church of Anderbury.

     The old church was seen to advantage at such an hour, for as the sky 
was
cloudless, and the stars were out, the tapering spire looked like some great
and gigantic indication raised there for some purpose pointing heavenward.

     There was a deep gloom surrounding the whole place, for there was not a
shadow cast by any one object, neither had the church one side that was
lighter than the other.

     In a very short time the baron reached the charnel-house, or the
bone-house, as it was more usually called.  It was a small place, attached 
to
the church itself.  The wants of the population were not great; and,
therefore, all these public places were built with the view only of a 
limited
use.

     It was large enough for all purposes, and as large as it is usual for
them to be in such places; and the baron, before he attempted to enter the
place, took a walk all the way round, to ascertain if there was any one
lurking about; but finding none, he returned to the door of the charnel-
house
with the full intention of going in.

     However, there was no key, and he could not, therefore, enter it by the
usual way, and he must find some other.

     "There is sure to be something or other," he muttered, "to cause a
temporary stop to one's career in some place or other; but I will not be
deterred by such a trifle-- there is a place in the roof somewhere here, I
think, where I can get in with but little trouble."

     The baron looked about for a place that would enable him to climb up, 
but
he suddenly withdrew his hand, exclaiming, --

     "Hilloa! what have we here?"

     It was soon settled, and the baron held up between him and the light 
the
key of the charnel-house, which he had found as he put his fingers into a
niche to assist him in lifting himself up to the roof.

     "This is lucky, and will save me much trouble; but I have not much time
to spare."

     He put the key into the lock, and found it fitted the lock, and he in
another moment opened the door of the charnel-house, and entered its
unwholesome precincts.

     There were but few who would have entered that place at that hour,
knowing, too, that a man was lying dead that had died a violent death; few,
indeed, would have done so, but the baron was himself above such
considerations; and besides, he had an object in view, which was of some
importance.

     He desired to watch the body of the murdered man -- he desired to stay
there, and watch the effects of the moon's rays upon it.  He now smelt where
he was, for there was that fetid smell of death, which always hangs about 
the
bone-house, which is a receptacle of all the mortal remains of man, which 
have
been once cast into the grave, for which their friends have paid large fees 
--
as well for the ceremony, as for the quiet enjoyment of the home of death; 
but
which bargain must be continually violated, and the bones of a man's 
ancestor,
instead of ornamenting some museum, or his carcass doing some good by way of
instruction, lie rotting in the grave-yard, till the sexton digs up the same
ground and takes fresh his fees, but burning the bones of the former.

     The baron entered the receptacle of the remains of mortality.  One 
after
the other have men's bones been thrown in here, or, perhaps they have been
mixed together, so that it would have puzzled an angel to have separated 
them
from each other.

     What more could mortals expect? their bones, at least, will form a fuel
to be sure; but very indifferent fuel, too.

     Here, however, the baron entered, and stepped lightly into the place.  
It
was an uncomfortable place at best -- cold, cheerless, very bare, save of 
such
things as would remind one of the sexton's duty, and of the nature of the
place in which he was.

     The first thing the baron did, was to look towards the place where the
window was placed, but no light came in.  He advanced to it, and gazed out
upon the night.

     "Well, well," he muttered, "the moon is just rising; there will be time
enough, and I can remain in this place as long as any of its rays penetrate
the windows."

     He paused a few moments, during which he looked out upon the country; 
but
all was wrapped up in gloom and darkness, save where some of the moon's 
beams
fell, and then there could be seen some dark spots more prominent than the
rest; and then, after awhile, he could distinguish between the different
objects, though he could not always tell their different parts.

     "Well," he muttered, "I am here now, and am housed.  Faugh! how the 
place
smells.  I shall never be able to remain here.  I shall never get the scent
from my nostrils."

     He turned from the window, and examined the place.  It was a square 
room,
with bare walls.  A few shelves, and some odd lumber thrown into one corner, 
a
ladder, some tools, trestles, and a lot of rubbish in the shape of old 
pieces
of coffins, bones, and other matters that belonged to a churchyard.  There 
was
very little in all this, to make the place at all likely to become popular
with anybody.

     The shell in which the man had been placed was, form some cause or 
other,
upset from off the trestles, and the body had rolled out.  It lay in all its
ghastly proportions at full length upon the ground, somewhat on one side, 
and
looking towards the window.  The posture shewed the body was deprived of 
life. 
It was still and motionless -- not a sound or motion escaped the lips of the
baron, as he gazed upon the victim of the ice-well.

     Well did the baron mark the position of the body, and marvel at the
singularity of the accident which had exposed the body in the way in which 
it
laid.

     "I wonder what could have been the cause of such an accident?  Who 
could
have thought it would have happened?  I am sure I never could have expected 
it
should have happened."

     He took one of the trestles that lay near the body, and placed it so 
that
he could gaze upon the corpse, and out at the window, alternately, without 
any
disturbance to himself.

     "Here I can watch the progress of the moon," he thought, "and the body,
too; and if I find my conjectures are right, I will soon prevent his 
quitting
this place, and put him in such a position as shall preclude the possibilty 
of
the revivifying powers of the moon ever reaching him again.  He shall lie 
till
corruption visits his body, and then a return to life be impossible."

     Thus muttered the baron, as he gazed fixedly at the body of the man, 
who
had met his death in the manner related, and of whom the baron entertained
some singular suspicions.

     The moon was rising above the horizon, and shed a soft light over the
fields and woods.  It was strange and silent, save when the church clock
struck out the hours as they fled.

     It was a strange sound, and almost startled the baron to hear the hour
come booming through the building, and gave such a sound, that it broke the
awful stillness of the night which reigned; the moon all the while rising
higher and higher in the heavens, until its beams came very near the window.

     The baron's patience became somewhat impaired; he saw that the time 
would
soon arrive, when his curiosity must be satisfied, and when the truth would 
at
once break in upon him.

     "Can it be," he muttered, "that the dead should ever again rise to
communicate with the world, and live to lead a loathsome life?  Impossible!
and yet 'tis said so by many, who assert they speak but the evidence of 
their
own senses; if it is to be depended upon at all, it will be as well for me 
as
they.

     "Why should I not be satisfied as well as they are?  I have, moreover,
more than ordinary motives for satisfaction.  The human bloodsucker shall 
not
live.  I am resolved upon that."

     The moonbeams now entered the window of the charnel-house.  At first it
was but a pencil ray, so small and minute, that the baron himself could 
scarce
perceive it; but he did see it, and kept his eye intently fixed upon it,
watching its increase in size and change of position with intense 
excitement.

     There was the moon rising high in the heaven, with all its myriads of
stars, and black canopy, studding the vault with innumerable gems; and as it
rose, so it gave a far greater change to the aspect of the landscape than
would have been expected.

     The whole side of the charnel-house was illuminated by the moon's rays,
but they fell aslant and only entered the window in one direction, which 
cast
them on one side, near where the baron sat.

     He could now see how the place was furnished; the significant
appurtenances of the charnel-house were easily discernible, and would have
given a melancholy turn to the thoughts of anybody who might have examined
them; but not so the baron -- he was by far too excited to heed them, though
he honoured them with a passing glance.

     They are used by the sexton in the prosecution of his business, in the
performance of his duties; therefore, there need be but little attention 
paid
to them; they cannot harm any one, but are the means of frightening fools.

     To frighten the baron was, however, something more than a mere matter 
of
course; his nerves were strung to the purpose with which he visited the 
place,
and they were not to be disturbed by any insignia whatever.  There were 
plenty
of ghastly objects about; bones, legs, hands, arms, and even sculls, were
lying about in profusion, or rather they were heaped up in one corner of the
place, and there was an attempt to hide them by heaping up old boards in 
front
of them, as if it were done on purpose to prevent the prying eye of man from
peeping and seeing the secrets of the charnel-house.

     It is strange, but true, being accustomed to such scenes as these 
causes
a diminution of the awe and fear in which such things are usually held. 
Soldiers and sailors care not much for death; they are used to exposure, and
the loss of life does not seem to them so terrible as to those who have 
never
faced danger.

     So with the sexton: he turns up the remains of mortality, as if they 
were
so much rubbish, and never had been endowed with life; indeed, it is only
necessary to become familiar with the remains of man, and then much of the 
awe
and mystery attending them dies away.

     What cares the grave-digger whether the burial service has been read 
over
the remains or not?  What cares he if the ground in which they have been
placed is consecrated ground?  He can't tell the difference, and it matters
not to him; he is above such consideration, and so is he and his patrons, as
to whether the spot in which the remains lie, has been bought and paid for
long ago.

     He has no objection to sell again that which has been sold, and that
which has been used as the resting-place of some one or other.  No matter,
they say; the mystery, the freemasonry, and all, have been instituted for 
the
multitude, and not for those who are behind the curtain, and pocket the 
fees;
that is the great object of the conspirators.

     However, here they were, all lumped up together, on one side, or rather
in one corner, with a few boards thrown over them, as if to prevent their
being seen by any incidental intruder.

     Here the baron sat, watching the moonlight in its slow progress towards
the dead body; and, as it crept towards the object, he felt more and more
excited, but yet remained perfectly immoveable.  He turned his eyes 
sometimes
from the body to the streak of moonlight that passed through the small 
window,
and then to the small window itself, from which he could see the moon 
himself,
but that was fast rising too high, and was becoming invisible by changing 
its
position, so that the baron could not see it.

     "The moon travels fast," he muttered, "and a few more minutes will tell
me what I am to expect."

     As he spoke these words, he felt in his pocket, and appeared satisfied
with what he found there -- possibly some weapon.  The moon's rays were now
within an inch or so of the body, an all was as still and silent as the 
grave;
no sound, no motion, not even a breath of air stirred to interrupt the 
silence
and stillness of the scene; even the breathing of the baron himself was
suppressed, and he strove to watch without motion.

     The moonlight appeared to grow more brilliant, more beautifully white,
and cast, as he thought, a stronger and more sickly light than usual into 
the
charnel-house.  There was nothing that he had ever before seen like it, and 
he
looked around him more than once to assure himself that he was where he was,
and that he was alone with the body in the bone-house.

     At such moments the fancy is apt to play us strange freaks, and, if not 
a
strong and nervous man -- capable of throwing off any extraneous influence,
why he would soon be bowed down by the weight of mental terror and agony --
that is, nothing short of temporary madness, and which probably would make a
permanent impression, and leave the seeds of mental disease for ever.

     But the baron was not easily moved; he had not been brought up in 
schools
where the mind is bound, enchained from infancy by artificial means, which
seem to bind the powers of the mind in after years, and, in moments of doubt
and difficulty, to render it dependent upon any extraneous circumstance,
rather than itself.

     However, there were few things thought of then by the baron, who sat
intently watching the progress of the moon's beams towards the body, which 
was
now touched by them.

     The light fell strong, it edged the white garments that were thrown
around the body; the baron watched more and more intently, and each moment
lessened the space of time when the truth would come out -- when he would be
assured of the truth of his conjectures.

     There was no ray on the body yet, but it slowly and slowly let the 
light
approach the body; the edge was illumined, and then the moonbeams fell more
and more upon it; gradually did they enlarge its surface till the whole body
was in the light of the moon.

     The baron's excitement and expectation were now at the highest, for the
whole body was illuminated.

     "Now!" he exclaimed, in a muttered whisper; "now is the moment."

     No sooner was the whole of the body, the breast, and the face 
illumined,
than there was a perceptible quiver through that form.

     "Ha!" exclaimed the baron, with a start.

     The features presented a ghastly spectacle; there was a peculiar sickly
and horrible expression in the countenance, much of which was caused by the
peculiar position in which it was placed; the peculiar colour of the moon's
rays and the additional horrors of the place, all seemed to give an effect 
to
an object peculiarly ghastly and horrible.

     The body, after a few moments, as if awakening to life and 
recollection,
lifted up its head, and turned over upon one side towards the moonlight; and
then, after a moment, it looked up in the moon's rays, which seem to pour 
down
upon the countenance that lifted up towards it.

     The baron rose softly and stealthily.

     "You shall feel that this is your last hour.  The newly awakened life
which feeds upon the blood of others, shall never exist to carry on its
disgusting career."

     As he muttered these thoughts to himself, he drew a short dagger from 
his
pocket; at the same moment the figure turned its face towards him.

     It gave a half unearthly scream, as its eyes met those of the baron's,
who exclaimed,

     "Now-- now's the time-- death to the monster."

     As he spoke, he threw himself headlong on the prostrate form of the
vampyre, for such it was; which, as he did so, endeavoured to rise up and
escape.  The baron, who had aimed a deadly blow at him, as he threw himself
upon him, caused him to fall back again; but the fearful being had contrived
to ward off the blow, either with its arms, or by means of shifting its
position, or something of the sort; the baron missed the blow, and was now 
in
a deadly struggle with the vampyre.

     The struggle was fierce; no signs of shrinking on the part of the 
baron,
who carried it on with the full intention of its ending fatally to his
opponent, while he was exerting himself to escape the muscular grasp of the
baron.

     The baron, however, was not a match for the more than superhuman 
strength
of the vampyre, who, endued with all the energy of love of a newly-acquired
life, struggled with a desperation scarely to be conceived.

     Had any one looked in, from without, upon the struggle that was going 
on
within, they would have believed that some demons of the dead had suddenly
become endued with the power of appearing upon earth, and had chosen that 
spot
upon which they could exercise their malignity in combat with each other.

     Suddenly, however, the baron was thrown with great force upon the 
ground,
and he lay for a moment half stunned; then the vampyre, disengaged as he 
was,
stopped to cast a magnificent look of triumph upon his fallen foe, and 
dashed
out of the bone-house by the same entrance as that which afforded ingress to
the place to the baron.

     In another moment the baron rose up and rushed after the flying 
vampyre;
his defeat by no means extinguishing his courage or ardour.

     He soon caught sight of the vampyre as he was flying from the bone-
house;
indeed, the moonlight was now so strong, that it seemed almost day.

     Every object, far or near, appeared distinct and observable; while the
waves of the ocean appeared every now and then to throw off the silvery 
light,
like a thousand moving mirrors.

     Beautiful as the scene was, there was none there who stood to look upon
it.  The only living and breathing persons present, were those who were
engaged in the chase.  Not a soul, save these two, were about -- none saw 
them
-- none witnessed the fearful efforts of the two.

     The place looke like some spot of earth spoken of by the enchanters; 
all
was motionless and still, save these two, and the ceaseless motion of the
ocean waves.

     The vampyre made for the shore, with the baron a short distance behind
him.  They strained every nerve; and the baron thought he should succeed in
securing him on the beach.

     There were some boats that were secured on the beach, and towards these
the vampyre sped with the fleetness of the wind; and, no sooner did he reach
one, than seizing its head, he caused it to run through the sand by the
impetus he had acquired in running, and it was afloat in a moment.

     There was no time to lose, for just as he had pushed into deep water, 
the
baron had rushed down almost in time to seize the boat but missed it.

     He then made for the boats, and succeeded in reaching one that was 
afloat,
secured only by a rope.

     In this he pushed out on the waves in pursuit of the object of his
search.  Away they both went; the sea was comparatively smooth; they both
rowed with velocity, that promised much as regarded their capability as
rowers.

     The spray of the water was thrown up by their oars and by the boats'
heads.  The baron, however, had the worst of it; he rowed to disadvantage;
because, every now and then, he had to turn his head to see which way the
object of his pursuit was rowing; and, therefore, a loss of speed occurred;
but yet he kept up well in the wake of the vampyre.

     There was, however, no attention paid as to where he was going; as long
as it was straight in the wake of the flying, he was satisfied.  But he saw
nothing else, nor looked at aught else; indeed, the world might have been
there, and he would not have been aware of the fact.  His whole faculties 
were
bound up in the object before him, to reach which, he exerted his whole
strength.  However, upon looking up again, he could nowhere see the vampyre.

 Next Time: The Baron Proposes for Helen Williams, and Is Duly Accepted, 
With
 a Compliment on His Beauty.




                                 CHAPTER CV.

THE BARON PROPOSES FOR HELEN WILLIAMS, AND IS DULY ACCEPTED, WITH A 
COMPLIMENT
ON HIS BEAUTY.


     The baron had put out to sea in chase of the vampyre, without 
considering
that there was really great danger in so doing, inasmuch as that the 
elements
were not quite in a kindly disposed condition, and there was a heavy sea.

     Where he had obtained his skill as a seaman, Heaven only knows; but
certain it is he had obtained such knowledge somewhere, for he commenced
navigating the boat with the greatest skill, and soon succeeded in getting
close in shore.

     The moment the keel grated upon the beach, a man rushed into the water,
and laid hold of the boat with one hand, and the baron with the other,
exclaiming, --

     "You are my prisoner!  You took my boat, and I don't care who or what 
you
are, I will have justice."

     "How much money do you require?"

     "More than you will like to pay.  I sha'n't let you off under a pound."

     "Here are five pounds."

     "Lor!  Excuse me, your honour; I didn't mean what I said; if so be as
your honour is such a gentleman as I now sees as your honour is, it don't 
make
any matter in the world.  I hopes as how your honour will always take my 
boat
when you wants one, and no mistake."

     The baron made no reply to all these compliments, but walked away at 
once
towards his own house on the cliffs.

     "I have missed him," he muttered, "and all my labour has been in vain.  
I
thought that at least I had got rid of that affliction; I thought that he at
least would have rotted in the tomb.  Curse on the tardiness that left him
unburied until the moonbeams had rested upon him.  After that all was in 
vain,
unless some new death had come over him."

     There was a flush of anger upon the baron's face as he reached his own
house, and let himself into it by a garden-gate that he always kept the key
of, which would have effectually prevented any of his servants from taking
any notice of him, had they met him.

     But at such an hour, it was not likely he should meet any one, nor did 
he
do so.

     He at once sought his own chamber, where he remained for some time
immersed in deep thought.  This thought was not wholly devoted to a
consideration of his annoyance at the escape of the vampyre; but he took 
into
his most serious thoughts the circumstances attending upon his 
entertainment.

     The question of to marry, or not to marry, was not one that had to be
settled by the baron.  No, that he had done already; and he had not made the
announcement he had to Mr. Leek, of his matrimonial intention, unadvisedly.

     What the baron now considered was, whether he should propose to Miss
Helen Williams or not.

     He certainly had been somewhat struck by the quiet beauty of the young
girl; and probably he was aware that he was not just the sort of person to 
win
a young maiden's heart, and that if he achieved such a honour at all, it 
would
most probably be in consequence of acting upon the cupidity of her 
relations.

     As he was determined, therefore, to marry, it became necessary that he
should select some one for his victim who, in addition to the personal 
charms
which appeared to him to be a desideratum, should be of so pliant and 
amiable
a disposition as to give way to those solicitations and incessant
remonstrances which she was likely to be assailed with if she resisted.

     It was fortunate for Mr. Leek that the baron did fix his regards upon
Helen Williams; because, from what we know of Mrs. Williams, we can well
perceive that it is quite evident she will not let any considerations of her
daughter's happiness stand in the way of an equitable arrangement with that
gentleman.

     And although there might have been, and indeed were, persons at the
baron's entertainment whom he would more gladly have called by the name of
bride than Helen Williams, yet he was not slow to perceive that those 
parties
had wills of their own, and, if their relatives had pleased to do so, they
would not themselves have admitted that they were up for sale to the highest
bidder.

     The result of the baron's considerations, therefore, was, that Helen
Williams would suit him very well, and that the poverty of her family was 
just
the circumstance of all others which insured his success.

     "I will wed her," he said, "although I cannot win her.  She will be 
mine,
because I shall purchase her; which, to my mind, is a much more admirable 
mode
of embarking in a matrimonial career than the trouble of a tedious 
courtship,
with all its frivolities and follies."

     Whether or not the baron was used to matrimonial affairs, we cannot 
say;
but certain it is he did not seem to consider that the proposing for a young
lady and marrying her was a matter of very grave or serious moment; but
really, by the style in which he considered it, anybody would have thought 
it
one of the most ordinary concerns of life.

     During his short stay at Anderbury, he had managed, by the magic power 
of
wealth, to procure everything he required in the shape of servants, 
carriages,
and horses; and now, on the morning after his most strange and mysterious
adventure with the corpse of the murdered man, he ordered his carriage, and
went out to pay a number of visits to the parties who had been present at 
his
entertainment.

     Among those visits he included one to the Williams's family, and by 
about
 twelve o'clock in the day reached their residence, and was received with 
such
 an extraordinary amount of bustle, that it was quite ludicrous to see it; 
but
 still it suited him, because it showed how they worshipped wealth, with the
 exception of Helen, and she did not make her appearance at all.

     Mrs. Williams was all smiles and sweetness, paying so many compliments 
to
the baron, that, although he knew nothing of the diplomatic arrangement of 
Mr.
Leek, he yet felt quite certain that he had her with him most completely, 
and
that none of her exertions would be wanting for the purpose of securing his
victim.

     After these compliments had somewhat subsided, the baron said, --

     "Madam, I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing your daughter Helen,
who did me the honour of being at my poor entertainment the other evening, 
and
attracted while there the eyes of all beholders."

     "Oh, certainly, my lord baron.  I have not the slightest doubt in my 
own
mind but that Helen is quite-- quite panting, in a manner of speaking, for 
the
honour of seeing you again."

     "You are very obliging, madam; and I can assure you that one of the 
most
gratifying circumstances that have occurred to me during my short residence 
in
this neighborhood, had consisted in the fact of my making the acquaintance 
of
you and your amiable family."

     "Will you excuse me for one moment?" said Mrs. Williams; and, after a
courteous bow from the baron, she left the apartment, and proceeded to the
room of her daughter Helen, whom she addressed, saying, --

     "Helen, are you aware that the baron is here-- the great baron, the 
Baron
Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh?  Good God! how can you be so foolish?  He has
actually asked for you, and you are not there; when you know as well as I 
do,
Helen, that such a man as that, to whom the expense is no object, might pop 
in
a moment."

     "He might what, mother?"

     "Pop the question-- propose, of course.  Don't tell me that you don't
know what I mean.  I have no patience with such nonsense.  Only think how 
rich
he is.  You know as well as I that it would be the making of you and the 
whole
family; and I can tell you, Helen, that, if you are not a positive fool, in 
my
opinion, he will pop, for there was quite a particular expresssion upon his
face when he asked for you."

     "But I fancy, mother, there is always a particular expression upon his
face-- a particularly ugly one, I mean; for, beyond all question, he is the
most ordinary man I ever saw in my life."

     "Now, really, Helen, you are enough to vex a saint.  What can a man's
looks have to do with his property?"

     "But what's his property to me, mother?"

     "Oh! good gracious!  Have I lived to hear a child of mine ask what a
man's property is to her, when he begins to be attentive!  I did not expect
it-- I will confess, I did not expect it.  I did think there would be a 
little
consideration on the part of a child of my own, when she knows I have to
strive, and strive, and stretch our means like a thin piece of Indian 
rubber,
to make both ends meet."

     "But, mother, if I cannot love this man, wherefore should I for one
moment entertain the thought of making him my husband?"

     "Self, self!" exclaimed Mrs. Williams, lifting up her hands; "nothing 
but
self."

     "I cannot suppose, mother, that it is an extraordinary act to decline
sacrificing one's whole existence for the sake of marrying a man with money,
who can not only not love, but who is an object of positive aversion as this
man is to me."

     "Yes," exclaimed Mrs. Williams; "that's right.  See me dragged to
prison, and see us all without shoes to our feet.  That's what you would do,
rather than give up your nonsensical notion about people's looks."

     "But, why," said Helen, "should these calamities, which have never yet
appeared, all suddenly come over us, bcause I do not feel inclined to marry
the Baron Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh?"

     "And as for the man's looks," added Mrs. Williams, rather adroitly
shifting the argument, and declining to answer the rather home question put 
by
Helen -- "as for the man's looks, I am quite ashamed of any daughter of mine
talking about men's looks-- it's indelicate, positively indelicate."

     "I cannot see your argument, mother, and I implore you not to persecute
me about this man, whom I really cannot love."

     "Persecute, indeed! but I tell you what it is, Helen, you don't seem to
be at all aware, first of all, that I am drowned in debt; secondly, that I
shall have to bring your brother Charles home from college to make him a
tailor, or a shoemaker, or something of that sort, and you will have to go 
out
as a daily governess, while I rot away by slow degrees in a prison."

     "But, mother, if these evils are all about to fall upon us, cannot some
fair means be adopted of extrication from them.  Your income, I always
understood, was a certain one, and surely it almost amounts to criminalty to
live far beyond it."

     "Not at all, when you expect your daughter to be a reasonable 
Christian,
and to marry decently and respectably.  Really, my dear, I must say that I
little expected such remarks as you make, from a child of mine, I can tell
you."

     Mrs. Williams was right enough there, for it was a wonder that such
remarks should come from a child of her's, who could not be supposed to have
heard any such sentiments, but who must have, from the mere force of a just
and admirable disposition, given utterance to them.

     "Mother," she said, after a pause, "do not fancy that I would not do 
much
to relieve you from any burthens you may have; and, if difficulties have
arisen, they are to be remedied in the best way we can, as well as 
regretted.
But I pray you not to ask me to wed this man, whom I cannot love."

     "Well, well.  I'm sure you make a terrible fuss, and I don't know what
about, for my part.  It's nothing, I rather suppose; and, after all, the 
baron
may not be going to propose at all for you, and I may be wrong."

     As Mrs. Williams thus admitted the possibilty that she might be wrong,
she looked with an expression of countenance, as much as to say, "Did you
ever, in all your life, hear of such virtue as that, or such self-denial?"

     "Then what do you wish for me to do, mother?"

     "To see him.  You cannot put such a slight-- indeed, I might almost 
say,
an insult upon him, as not to see him when he actually calls and asks for 
you. 
He is, you know, after all, a gentleman."

     Helen found it difficult to say that she would not see the baron, so,
although it was done with great reluctance, she followed her mother to the
room in which that lady had left him, and where he did most anxiously expect
her.  He felt that his cause was not quite so good as it had been, and that
the non-appearance of Helen got up some serious doubts as to the complying
disposition he thought she had.

     When, however, he at length saw her, some of those fears were 
dispelled,
and he began to imagine that his suit did not look quite so desperate.

     There was certainly about the baron a rather courtly air and manner,
which, as Mrs. Williams said, shewed that he lived in the best society; and
Helen would not allow her aversion to the man to carry her so far as not to
behave to him with politeness, so that for some moments that the 
conversation
proceeded, any one would have thought that those three persons were upon the
most amicable of terms with each other.

     But Mrs. Williams, like some skilful old general, was well versed in
matrimonial tactics, and, after making a few remarks, she deliberately left
the room, to poor Helen's great chagrin; for, although she had consented out
of ordinary civility to see the baron, she had by no means intended to have 
a
_tete-a-tete_ with him.

     That was quite another affair, and one may well suppose what a degree 
of
indignation she felt at being forced into such circumstances, and by her
mother, too, who, of all persons in the world, ought to have protected her,
and to whom she ought to have looked certainly for very different things
indeed.

     It was a very awkward situation to be placed in for poor Helen, 
inasmuch
as she now really could not leave the baron completely alone without great
rudeness; and yet she much dreaded, in consequence of the hints that her
mother had thrown out, what the interview would be that was about to ensue.

     How devoutly and particularly she hoped that, after all, the 
supposition
of her mother that the baron had any matrimonial intentions towards her was 
a
mistake, and she felt that the first words he might utter would be the means
of chance letting her know if such really was the case, or if she was to be
what she could not help styling, the victim of his addresses.

     Of course the baron knew perfectly well that Mrs. Williams had taken 
her
departure for the express purpose of giving him an opportunity of pressing 
his
suit to her daughter, if he felt so disposed, and as he did feel so 
disposed,
he was not at all likely to neglect the opportunity.

     None but a man of great tact and discretion, however, could have made 
so
good use of such an opportunity as the baron; for although he certainly did
not succeed in removing from the mind of Helen Williams a strong feeling 
that
he was an uncommonly disagreeable man, he did not add to that impression.

     "Miss Williams," he said, "I have not until now had an opportunity of
thanking you for the very great favour you did me, by making one at the 
party
at Anderbury House."

     "The obligation," said Helen, "was on my side, sir, and I beg that you
will not pay me so empty a compliment as to endeavour to make it otherwise."

     "You do yourself a great injustice.  The grace which you lent to my
entertainment was to my mind its greatest charm.  I feel, I assure you,
compelled to say so much, because it is the genuine truth, and not for the
purpose of paying to you an empty compliment, which I have too much respect
for you to do."

     Helen was silent, for she knew not very well what to reply to this
speech, inasmuch as it was one of those general ones that require no reply,
unless the persons to whom they are uttered choose to enter at length into a
civil complimentary kind of warfare, for the express purpose of so doing.

     The baron waited for some reply to be made, and then, as none came, he
spoke himself, saying, after at least two minutes' pause, --

     "Miss Williams, you may, or you may not, have heard that my principal
intention in settling in this neighbourhood-- which I was informed, and I 
find
correctly so, is celebrated for the respectability of its inhabitants-- was 
to
marry."

     "Sir," said Helen, "I know nothing of that matter, nor do I think it is
one with which I ought to be in any way troubled."

     "Without explanation, certainly not, Miss Williams; but will you allow 
me
to add, that unless my speech had contained certainly something more than a
mere compliment, or a mere desire to give you a piece of gossipping
information, I should not have uttered it on any account; but I have 
something
to add to it, which does concern your private ear most particularly, and
which I do hope will meet with your favourable consideration."

     He paused again, and, as Helen returned no answer, he after a time
continued, saying, in a still lower tone, --

     "May I venture to hope that no preconceived prejudice will have the
effect of diminishing any expectations and hopes with which I have pleased
myself?"

     It is said, and said most truly too, that there are none so blind as
those who won't see, and the same rule may be most unquestionably applied to
those who won't hear or understand; and although it was, of course, 
impossible
that Helen Williams could have any doubt as to what the baron meant, she was
resolved tht he should speak out plainly, in order that she might, without
giving room for any ambiguity, likewise speak as plainly to him, in answer 
to
the proposition that was upon his lips.

     Perhaps the baron was wise enough to see that much, for he proceeded 
now
with much more clearness to declare what he meant, when he said, --

     "I told you, Miss Williams, that my object in coming here was to 
contract
a matrimonial alliance, being tired of the solitary life I had been leading
for some years.  I should not have troubled you with such a communication, 
had
it not been in my power to add to it another, that will explain why I did 
so."

     Helen merely inclined her head, to signify that she heard him.

     "That other communication," he continued, "is to the effect that I have
found the person on whom I feel convinced that I can fix my affections,
without the possibility of their ever wandering again from the dear object.
Amid all the rank, beauty, and intelligence that graced my halls on that
occasion which will ever be hallowed in my imagination, I had eyes but for 
one
form, and ears but for one voice."

     Still Helen was silent.

     "There may be many who, in the possession of much attraction and much
virtue, may make many happy homes; but the heart culls its own flower, and
will think that it presents the most delicate and most beautiful tints to 
the
eye.  That flower, from amidst all the galaxy of beauty, I think-- nay, I
know, that I have selected.  Can you not now guess the purport of my simple
words, Helen?"

     It was tolerably familiar to call her Helen upon so short an
acquaintance, and she drew back, looking some astonishment, which he
perceiving, and divining the cause -- for no one could accuse the baron of
want of tact -- replied to.

     "Forgive me, if, in conversing with you, my heart seems to forget the
distance that is between us, and I think of you by that name which, 
certainly,
is is presumptuous on my part to call you by; but there are persons in whose
thoughts and feelings we so deeply sympathize, and who, from the first 
moment
that we see them, become bound to us by so many mysterious links of feeling,
that we seem as if we had known them for ages, and as if, from that moment, 
we
could be as familiar-- ay, much more so-- than with many whom we may have 
met
often in the great world."

     This was true, and, what is more, it happened to be a truth that 
touched
a right chord in the breast of Helen Williams; for she felt what he said
recall recollections of the past, when there was one whom she had seen, and,
from the first moment that she had seen him, had felt that time and
circumstances could effect no change in those first dear and delightful
impressions which had swept across her heart.

     The baron saw the contemplative aspect of her face, and he added, --

     "You feel the truth of what I utter?"

     She started, for she had indeed felt the truth of the sentiment, 
although
her heart was far away, and for a moment she had completely forgotten the
existence of the baron, or that it was from his lips she had heard the
sentiment expressed.

     It was a mortification to him to see this -- for he did see it -- and 
he
said, --

     "Miss Williams, I hope I have said enough, at all events, to convince 
you
that I am not one of those cold, worldly-minded spirits who have none of 
what
may be truly called the higher and the nobler feelings of humanity; but who
can, and who do feel and think that there is much of beauty and much of
innocence in life, and that both are the dearest and best gifts of Heaven."

     "I have nothing to say in contradiction to what you have uttered," said
Helen; "but you will, I trust, now excuse me, sir, from continuing a
conversation which can have no good result, and which, between persons who 
are
nearly perfect strangers, is scarcely desirable."

     This was a speech which, if anything would, was calculated to bring the
baron to the point at once; and, as she rose while she uttered it; as with 
an
intention of leaving the room, he at once said, --

     "Nay, as I am here, allow me to utter that which I came to speak, and 
do
not, I pray you, hastily decide upon a question of more importance to 
yourself
and to me than any which can be ordinarily asked.  Let me beg of you, Miss
Williams, to be seated, and to believe that, in my manner of putting this
question to you, there shall be nothing which can, in the slightest degree,
prove offensive to you."

     Thus urged, it would have been something savouring of ill-manners, if
Helen Williams had refused to accede to his request; and, although there was
nothing she so devoutly wished as that that interview should be over, and 
over
quickly, she felt that perhaps the surest way of accomplishing that object,
was to listen quietly to what he had to say; and accordingly she did so,
reseating herself again on the chair she had so recently occupied, and
determined in her own mind to give him a decisve answer.  He then seemed
rather in doubt as to how he should commence, and, as he spoke, there was an
air of hesitation and doubt about him such as he, indeed, very seldom wore.

     Probably, he felt that it was rather a climax that he had arrived at, 
and
that if he was to accomplish anything in the matrimonial way, it was a very
doubtful case as regarded his present application.

     "I cannot but feel," he said, "that what I am about to say sounds hasty
and premature, considering that we have known each other for so short a 
space
of time.  It is not for me to enlarge upon circumstances which, I fear, will
have but little weight with you; but still it is my duty to mention that I
have a large fortune, and consequently can afford to place the object of my
affections in such a position in life as that she shall feel surrounded with
everything that can make her existence pleasant and desirable."

     "Go on, sir," said Helen; "I am staying to hear you, in order that I
might clearly and distinctly answer you."

     This was by no means encouraging; but still the baron proceeded: --

     "I wish to make you an offer of my hand and heart; and, as the Baroness
Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh, I am quite certain that you will add a dignity to
that title, instead of receiving one from it."

     "Sir," said Helen, "an offer of this kind from any gentleman is a
compliment which ought always to be appreciated, and I assure you it is one
which I feel highly; but as one's future happiness in a marriage is by far 
too
important an affair to be trifled with, I must beg to decline the honour you
intend me."

     "Decline!" said the baron.

     "Yes, sir, I said decline; and I trust that the justice of the Baron
Stolmuyer will effectually preserve me from anything in the shape of a
persecution for so declining."

     At this moment, and before the baron could make any answer to what was
said to him by Helen in this firm and determined manner, the door was flung
open, and Mrs. Williams rushed into the room.

     "My dear sir," she cried to the baron, "of course you understand these
matters perfectly well.  Girls, you know, are always so very unreasonable,
that you can't expect anything from them but a refusal at first, although 
they
may really mean quite the reverse."

     "Mother, is this just or fair?" said Helen, reproachfully.

     "Oh, stuff-- stuff! don't speak to me about justice and fairness, 
indeed,
when you are so absurd as to behave in this dreadful manner towards the
baron."

     "But, madam," said the baron, "I fear----"

     "Fear nothing, my lord; but if you will have the kindness to step into
the next apartment for a few minutes, I will join you, and we can talk this
matter over."

     Mrs. Williams did not think it at all necesary to make any excuse for
having listened to the baron's overtures; and perhaps, indeed, she thought
that it was not necessary to do so, and that her interest in the affair was 
a
sufficient extenuation of what certainly was a most abominable proceeding.

     Shame and disgust at her mother's conduct now kept Helen silent; and as
the baron was perfectly willing to give himself all the chances he could, he
made a low bow, and left the apartment, in conformity with the desires of 
Mrs.
Williams, wondering much in his own mind by what miracle she purposed
influencing her daughter's decision after the extremely positive negative 
she
had given to his proposal.

     He waited with much impatience, as well as curiosity, and as our 
readers
may, as well as the baron, be a little curious to know what arguments Mrs.
Williams used, we shall proceed to give them a brief outline of what she 
said.

     "Are you mad?" was the first ejaculation.  "Are you thoroughly and
entirely out of your senses, that you behave yourself in this extraordinary
manner?"

     "In what extraordinary manner?  A man asks me if I can wed him and love
him, and, as he asks me politely, I tell him as politely that I cannot, 
which
is the whole of the affair.  Is there anything so very extraordinary in such
behaviour as that?"

     "Indeed, I think there is something very extraordinary in it.  I tell 
you
what it is, Helen, Mr. Leek is firmly of opinion that the baron's income 
must
be at least ten thousand pounds a-year."

     "I do not think I shall marry a man for his income, if it were ten 
times
that amount."

     "This is insanity-- positive insanity.  Have you really the least idea 
of
what you are talking about?  But I know what it is well enough; I know very
well what it is; of course it's that fellow, James Anderson, that comes
between you and your wits.  That's the scamp that prevents you from 
exercising
a proper control over yourself, and you know it is; but he is gone to sea, 
and
it is to be hoped we shall never look upon him again.  I don't wish to see
him, and I am quite sure you need not, so you had better make up your mind 
to
marry the baron at once."

     "This is too cruel-- much too cruel; and but that I see it with my own
eyes, I would not have believed it possible."

     She burst into tears as she spoke, and then for a brief moment -- but 
it
was only for a moment -- the heart of the mother was a little touched.  The
love of money again assumed its sway, and the happiness of her child sunk 
into
insignificance compared with that worst of passions.

     "Listen to me, Helen," she said: "it's all very well to make choice of
who you like, and to refuse who you like, when it can be done; but I tell 
you
that, in this case, it cannot be done, for we are all of us on the brink of
ruin, and, if you will not by this marriage rescue us from that state,
destruction must come upon us all.  You can save me, you can save your
sisters, and you can save your brother, if you will.  If [sic] course, if 
you
will not, I cannot make you; and you will have the consolation of knowing
that, although you had it in your power to save us all from destruction, you
did not do it."

     "But why should I be placed in so cruel a situation as to be called 
upon
to sacrifice myself completely for my family?  Would it not be nobler to 
meet
difficulties, if they have arisen, with a good spirit?"

     "As you please-- as you please; I can say no more."

     Mrs. Williams moved towards the door; but Helen called to her, saying, 
--

     "Give me time to think-- I only ask you to give me time to think."

     This was a grand concession, and Mrs. Williams at once acceded to the
proposition, that it was prudent to leave well enough alone in such a case,
and that, having once seen that persecution would do something, it was 
highly
desirable to leave it to work its way.

     She accordingly at once left the room, and proceeded into the adjoining
apartment, to which the baron had retired; and where, from his attitude, it
seemed highly probable that he had taken example by Mrs. Williams; and, as 
she
had listened to his conversation with her daughter, he had, in like manner,
listened to her.

     "I have the pleasure to inform you, baron," she said, "that my 
daughter,
although at first taken a little by surprise as regards your offer, now
accepts it; and I can only add, for my own part, that it is with great
pleasure I contemplate having so handsome and distinguished a son-in-law."

     "Madam, I highly esteem your compliment; and I must beg of you as a
favour, that you will fix the wedding-day as quickly as you please or can; 
and
that, as it must put you to some expense as well as your other daughters, 
and
as it would be very unjust that, on my account, you should expend one penny
piece, you will do me the favour of accepting from me a 500 pound note to
cover those expenses."

     Mrs. Willams quite instinctively held out her hand, but the baron 
added,
with a bow that damped her expectations a little --

     "A sum which I shall have the pleasure of handing to you as soon as the
wedding-day is fixed."

     It would be doing great injustice to the acuteness of Mrs. Williams, if
we did not say she quite understood this to be a bribe for expediting
proceedings; and if anything was likely to clench the matter, and to place 
the
marriage of the baron with Helen beyond the shadow of a doubt, it certainly
was this fact, that 500 pounds was offered to the mother for what we cannot
help calling the sale of her child.

     But these kind of things are much more common in society than people 
are
at all aware; and one half the marriages that take place at all, are most
unquestionably matters of barter.  When the highest bidder obtains the 
prize,
if prize that can be called, which generally consists of a shallow, 
conceited
heart, nurtured in all kinds of selfishness, and full of feelings, not one 
of
which can be considered great or estimable.

     It is sad, indeed, when, as in the case of Helen Williams, the victim 
is
made a victim on account of her better and nobler feelings, and where it is
not her own selfishness, but the selfishness of others, which she is 
condemned
to be victimized to.  Whether she will or will not consent, under the
circumstances we have narrated, to become the bride of the Baron Stolmuyer 
of
Saltzburgh, we shall shortly discover; but certain it is that he entertained 
a
strong notion she would, and that Mrs. Williams thoroughly made up her mind
that she should.

     Nothing can save Helen but a determination of character, which we fear 
we
cannot say she possesses.

     Her correct reason makes her say things which, if she could carry them
out, would be as proper and as decisive as possible; but the great fault of
her character consists in a weakness of purpose, which effecutally prevents
her from carrying out the suggestion presented to her by her own superior
intellect.

 Next Time: The Preparations for the Baron's Marriage. -- The Young Lover, 
and
 the Remonstrance.




                                CHAPTER CVI.

THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE BARON'S MARRIAGE. -- THE YOUNG LOVER, AND THE
REMONSTRANCE


     So it appeared that the baron was right, and that with all his
disqualifications he had succeeded in obtaining the promise of a wife, 
because
he had the one great qualification which outshone everything to his
disadvantage, namely, wealth.

     And he was not so blind, or so foolish, as not fully to understand, and
to know, that it was to the relatives of the bride, and not to the bride
herself, that he was indebted for an answer in the affirmative to his
proposition.

     Well he knew that although he had dazzled their eyes and awakened their
cupidity, he had produced no such an effect upon the young and beautiful 
being
who was about thus to be sacrificed upon the altar of Mammon; and probably 
if
anything could have added to his earnest desire to make her his, it was that
he saw she was untouched by the power of his gold, and therefore he could 
not
but respect, as well as admire her; and he much preferred taking to his arms
one for whom he entertained a supreme and sovereign contempt.

     She felt that she was a victim, and that if she consented to become 
his,
she must look upon herself as blighted and sacrificed for ever.

     But he was too selfish to hesitate on such a ground as that.  His
feelings were far from being so human as to stop short, because he knew the
alliance was viewed by her with hatred and horror.  And that she did view it
with those feelings, spared him, at all events, as he told himself, some
trouble, for it took away from the necessity of keeping up the constant shew
and glitter of wealth, for that shew and glitter affected her not, and
therefore would have been presented to her imagination in vain.

     But far different was it regarded her friends and connections, who had
arrogated to themselves the power of deciding upon this matter of life and
death to her.

     To them he felt that he must shew all the glitter of display that
belonged to his extensive means, or they would be disappointed, for they not
only wanted riches themselves, but they wanted the worldly reputation
contingent upon having so rich a relative.

     Therefore was it that he determined that nothing should be wanting at 
his
approaching nuptials to make them most magnificent, and he racked his
imagination to discover a mode by which he could spend a large sum of money,
so as to get for it the greatest amount of display.  This was a matter which 
a
man such as he was eminently calculated to achieve; and, as he succeeded in
fixing his nuptials to take place in a fortnight from that time, he had 
ample
time to make all such preparations as he might consider requisite.

     It so happened that on the following evening to that on which he had
obtained so strange a consent, through another party, to his matrimonial
speculation, that the sun sunk upon the coast with every appearance of
approaching stormy weather.

     Scarcely had its disc sunk below the western horizon, when a furious 
gale
arose, and, for the first time since his residence at Anderbury Hall, he 
felt
what it was to hold an estate so near to the sea-coast.

     The sea rose tempestuously, appearing to shake the mansion to its very
foundation, and more than one half of the excavation leading from the 
grounds
to the sea-coast was filled with water.  The gale blew off the sea, and one 
or
two trees upon the Anderbury estate were torn up by their roots, spreading
destruction around them among the numerous shrubs and flowers.

     Some of the windows of the mansion were dashed in, and the wind came
roaring into the house, whistling up the staircases, opening and shutting
doors, and altogether producing a scene of devastation and uproar which 
would
have terrified most persons.

     The baron, however, on the contrary, notwithstanding whatever damage 
was
done was of course done to his property, took the matter with the greatest
ease and composure in the world; and, in fact, rather seemed to enjoy the 
fury
of the elements than to be awed by them.

     He remained out of doors the whole time and although the rain now and
then fell in torrents, and drenched him to the skin, he seemed scarcely
conscious of that circumstance, or, if he were, he evidently thought it too
trivial to take any notice of.

     The servants looked at him in amazement, scarcely believing it possible
that any one in his senses could be so indifferent to the rage of the 
elements
that was proceeding; but they little knew the real character of the man whom
they had for a master, or they would have wondered at nothing, and been
surprised at nothing that they saw of him or heard of him.

     The storm continued until the night completely set in, and still it
showed no signs whatever of anything in the shape of an end; and it seemed 
but
too evident that it was likely to continue in all its wild and ungovernable
fury for many an hour to come.

     He got as close as he could to the beach, so as not to leave his own
estate, and from there he listened attentively to the howling of the blast,
seeming rather pleased with the idea than otherwise, that much mischief was
being done by that most terrific storm.

     A servant brought him a telescope, so that he could look out upon the
waste of waters, and see some of the struggling vessels that, with might and
main, were endeavouring to keep off the shore, but which, despite all their
efforts, were being hurried to destruction-- a destruction which they could
not avoid, and which must present itself in the most serious aspect, because
it appears inevitable, and is invested with all the misery of a protracted
execution.

     And in particular he remarked one vessel which was drifting onward to
certain and inevitable destruction.

     He could see the rockets and the blue lights that they burnt now and 
then
through the storm; while, ever and anon, with a booming strange sound over 
the
waste of waters there would come the signal gun of distress, with its awful
reverberations, awakening feelings of sympathy in the breast of every one 
but
the baron, and he seemed impenetrable to all human feeling, for he looked on
with a strange calmness, a calmness that one might suppose would set upon 
some
man who had nothing to do with human hopes, human thoughts, or human 
feelings,
but not by any means that calmness of a pure spirit looking upon things 
which
it would aid, if it could, but which are beyond its power of action.

     He saw the anxious throng of persons on the beach precisely below his 
own
estate.

     He saw them launch a boat, and, with a grim smile, he saw it swamped in
the surge, and the brave bold men, who had made the gallant endeavour to 
save
their fellows, met themselves, with but one exception, a watery grave.

     And then even the baron smiled, and muttered to himself, --

     "What is all this to me? what have I to do with human hopes and 
feelings?
What is it to me whether they live or die, or whether yon ship, that I now 
see
struggling through the waste of waters, reaches its destination, or is
engulfed for ever in the foaming surge?  What is it to me, I repeat, whether
these bold brave men live or die?  Will they not be the very persons to hunt
me from the face of society?  Will they not be the very persons who would
declare that I was unfit to live?  And shall I trouble myself with one 
thought
as to whether they live or die?  Ah! they come nearer, nearer, nearer still,
and I shall see such a sight as may not often be observed by one such as I 
am,
and on such a coast as this."

     There was a strange, wild, wailing cry, and the ship, which was a large
one, struck heavily upon a rock about a mile distant from the shore, and 
very
close, indeed, to where the Anderbury estates commenced.

     Now, as if seized with a sudden impulse, although we cannot and do not
think it was one of humanity, the baron descended by a large fissure in the
rock to the beach.  This took him some time to accomplish, for he had to 
walk
completely through the grounds of Anderbury Hall, and half-a-mile beyond,
before he reached it, and then it took him some time to walk down, because 
he
had to do so with extreme caution, inasmuch as the heavy rain that had 
fallen
had made the ground so slippery that it was with great difficulty he could 
at
all keep his feet.

     When he arrived in sight of the beach, the ship was gone, but a life 
boat
was being launched, amid the hurras of the multitude, for the purpose of
picking up some of the survivors of the wreck who were noticed drifting upon
portions of its hulk.

     The baron had brought his telescope with him, and he placed it to his
eye, and took a long and steady look at the boat.

     A muttered malediction came from his lips, and, having shut the
telescope, he turned, and hastily pusued his path again to Anderbury House.

              *            *            *            *            *

     After the wedding, Jack Pringle really felt himself so upset by the
quantity of healths he had drunk, and the general manner in which he had
disposed of a quantity of rum, that he told the admiral he found himself not
quite so well as he ought to be, and that he thought it was all owing to
having been out of sight of water for so many months.

     This was a plea which sounded very reasonable to the admiral, and when
Jack said, --

     "You know it ain't possible to live very long without a glimpse, at
least, of an arm of the sea, or something of that sort."

     The old man assented to the proposition at once, and replied, --

     "Why, that's true enough, Jack, and I shall have to go somewhere myself
soon, or else get musty; for, you may depend, it never was intended that 
human
beings should live all their lives on land."

     "I should think not," said Jack, and I what I was going to say was, 
that
you must try and take care of yourself, you old baby, for a day or two, 
while
I take a run to the coast.  It ain't above twenty-five miles; and mind you
don't get into any mischief till I come back."

     "Confound your impudence!  It's a very odd thing that you can't come 
into
my presence without a lie in your mouth.  You know you have been as much
trouble to me as a cargo of monkeys in a storm.  Be off with ye, and if I
never see your face again, it will be a good job."

     Jack considered that he had quite sufficiently announced his departure,
so he set off at once, and made his way towards the coast, not a little
pleased, as he neared it, to fancy that, every now and then, he kept 
snuffing
the sea air; and when the coach in which he went put him down within about
four miles of a little village inhabited by fishermen, he walked that
distance, although, sailor-like, it was an exercise he was by no means fond
of, and, to his great joy, once more stood upon a sandy beach, and heard the
murmur of the ocean, and saw the waves curling at his feet.

     He was quite delighted, and really felt, or fancied that he felt, which
was the same thing, wonderfully invigorated by the change, and quite another
thing to what he had been.

     Under such circumstances, Jack was sure not to be long in picking up a
companion, so, in one of the cottages into which, with all the free and easy
manner of a sailor, he strolled, he found an old man-of-war's man, retired
there to spend the remainder of his days along with his son and daughter.

     We feel that it would be quite impossible for us to do justice to the
meeting between those two worthies, for they soon found out the capabilities
of each.

     Some grog, which Jack thought the sweetest he had tasted for a long 
time,
because it was drunk within sight of the ocean, was produced, and then the
tales they set to telling each other of their adventures afloat, would have
been enough to stun any one.

     We have rather a fear, likewise, that in some cases, they were not so
strictly particular as they might have been had they been upon their oaths, 
as
regards truth; but they seemed to be upon the principle of mutual 
forbearance,
and the implied understanding of "You believe me, and I'll believe you."

     Whenever this kind of rivalry, however, commences between inveterate
story-tellers, there is no saying to what length they will go, and Jack
certainly related some extraordinary things.

     They happened both to have been to the same latitude, but, of course,
they had not both seen the same sights exactly, or enjoyed the same
adventures; so what one did not know or could not invent, the other pretty
soon did; so that between them they made up a most entertaining 
conversation,
and one which really would, to any one who was willing to be amused and not
very particular about veracity, have had great charms.

     "Ah," said the old sailor, "when I was on the coast of Ingee, the hair
melted off my head."

     "Did it," said Jack.  "Oh! that's nothing at all; we had a couple of 
men
roasted at the wheel with the heat, and they didn't know it, till they were
both done brown."

     "You don't say so?"

     "Yes, I does, and, what's more, we always had our meat cooked over 
again
upon one of the gun slides; and, after that, when we were a long way
southward, it was so cold not one of the crew shut his eyes for a week."

     "Indeed!  But you spoke of a man as you called Safety Jack; who was he? 
I
should like all for to know."

     "When I was on board the Fame, our captain was a know-nothing sort of
shore-going lubber, who had been guved a pair of swabs over better men's
heads, and uncommon afeared he was of getting into any danger.  He'd always
come on deck on a morning, and guving a kind of a hurry skurry skeared look
all round him, he'd say, if so be as he seed no land, --

     "'Where are we?  Is there any danger?'

     "Then our first luff he'd say, --

     "'No danger, sir; only a little fear.'

     "Then the captain he'd say, all the while looking as skeared as a 
marine
in a squall, --

     "'Let us be safe-- let us be safe, that's all.'

     "So we called him Safety Jack, in consekense o' that peculiarity.  
Well,
you must know as we were running for the Cape, and Safety Jack he wouldn't 
be
persuaded, but insisted upon hugging the coast of Africa all the way, cos, 
as
he said, it looked safer to see the land.  So, as it happened, when we 
neared
the Cape, we got into a regular north-westerly current, that set clear away
south-east, or it might be a few points more southerly.  The wind, too, blew
in the same direction, and it seemed a bad job altogether.  Our luff then
says, says he to the captain-- that's Safety Jack, you must understand, --

     "'It will take us some time to work into the bay with this wind and
current, but we can do it.'

     "'Is it safe?' said Safety Jack.

     "'Oh, yes,' said 'tother; 'though I have known a vessel of small 
draught
to be capsised hereaway.'

     "Safety Jack at this turns very pale, and he says, --

     "'Well, run before the wind a few leagues to the south; it's safer--
and-- and the gale may go down, and we may get out of the current-- and--
and-- besides, it's safer.'

     "Well, everybody grumbled, but Safety Jack would have his own way, and 
we
went spanking along with the wind and current nearly due south.

     "But instead of getting out of the current we got further into it, and
the gale increased to a hurricane.  We went through the water at such a rate
that the men who stood facing the wind could not button their jackets, or 
shut
their eyes, and there was the mate and five able-bodied men holding the
captain's hair on his head.  The men's teeth, too, were all blown out of 
their
mouths, and kept rattling among the rigging like half-a-dozen old shot in a
locker.  On we went, faster and faster, till all of a sudden we saw the 
sails
flapping against the masts, and the ship was evidently turning round in 
spite
of the helm.

     "'We're out of it now,' mumbles Safety Jack.

     "'I think we're in for it,' cried the mate.  'This is a whirpool!'

     "And so it was; round and round we flew like lightning, coming nearer 
to
one point at each turn.  The men all fell down on the deck as giddy as 
geese,
and Safety Jack he begins screaming.  Just to give you an idea of how we 
went
round, there was two of the crew as had a squabble about a bottle of rum, 
and
one on 'em says-- 'If I can't have it you sha'n't, and there it goes,' 
shicing
it behind him.  Well, you'll hardly believe it-- but the ship was going 
round
so fast in a circle of about a mile, that afore the bottle could drop the 
man
as threw it was brought round to it again, and it knocked his eye out.  
Well,
presently the ship gives a kind of shivering and stops for half a moment, 
and
Safety Jack he screams again.  Then the water opened like a well-hole, and
just for a moment we could see it bubbling and lashing like a boiling
cauldron.  Then down we went into the foaming surge like a lump of lead."

     "You don't mean to swear to that?"

     "Yes, I do; at any time and any day; I should think so, and rather 
think
I ought to know, as I was there."

     "And how did you get saved?  That's the question, my boy."

     "You ought to be satisfied about that, I should think," said Jack, "by
seeing me here.  If I had not escaped, I rather suppose I shouldn't have 
been
here to have told you about it."

     "That's all very well; but I ask you how you escaped?"

     "Oh, that's quite another thing.  I floated about for eight weeks upon 
an
empty tar barrel."

     "Eight weeks, did you say?"

     "Yes; eight weeks, two days, four hours, and three-quarters."

     "The deuce you did!  How came you to be so mighty particular as to the
three-quarters?"

     "Because I thought some fool would be sure to ask me.

     "Oh, that indeed; but the most odd thing that happened to me, I will 
say,
was when I was once wrecked on an island that we called Flee Island."

     "Flee Island; what a rum name!  What made you call it that, I should 
like
to know?"

     "Oh, a trifling circumstance-- there was nothing in it but flees, and
they were as big as elephants."

     "Very good," said Jack; "I can believe that, because there is nothing
outrageous about it.  I don't consider myself at all difficult to please, 
and
so long as you stick to such things as that nobody can doubt you will find 
it
all right with me."

     "I am very much obliged-- but should you happen ever to come across 
that
captain of yours again---"

     "Yes, but it were a good while afterwards I was on boad [sic] a whaler,
and I saw something floating that looked like a great lump of chalk, and 
when
we picked it up, who should it turn out to be but Safety Jack, what they 
call
putrified, and turned to something like white coral."

     "You don't mean that."

     "Yes, I do; we keep him out of curiosity for about a week lashed up to
the mainmast, but the men of the night watch were scared at him, and threw 
him
overboard, because they said, when the moonlight fell upon him, he for all 
the
world looked like a ghost, and they couldn't keep their eyes off him, which 
I
dare say was somewhere about the truth."

     "You certainly have seen a little service; but mix yourself another 
glass
of grog, and I shall do the same, for I don't mean to turn into hammock to-
night."

     "What for?"

     "Because there is going to be a storm.  I have not been looking at the
weather for so many years without being able to tell that before it comes.
There will be a storm before twenty-four hours are over, and I think it will
blow off the sea, so that there will be no end of mischief."

     Jack Pringle went to the door of the fisherman's hut, and, although the
evening had set in, he cast a scrutinizing glance at the heavens, looked
earnestly in the direction from whence the wind proceeded, and when he came
back again and sat down by the side of the old sailor, he said, --

     "You are right; there will not only be a storm, but such a one too as
they hav'n't seen for some time; so I shall no more think of turning in than
you do.  Who knows but that some vessel may be drifted in shore, and then we
who are seamen will be able to do more good than a score of your shore-going
fellows, who are afraid if the saltwater gets above their ankles."

     "That's true enough; when the wind does rise in this way, and blows a
strong gale, it is pretty clear that there will be something in the shape of
wreck to look at."

     The prognostications of Jack and the old sailor turned out, as we know,
to be tolerably correct, for the storm which they anticipated was precisely
that severe one which roused the Baron Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh from his
lethargy, and induced him to go down to the beach, to see what was likely to
be the fate of the vessel from which the signals of distress had proceeded.

     So soon as the wind began to howl, and the waves to dash upon the 
shore,
Jack Pringle and the old sailor left the cottage, and stood with great 
anxiety
upon the beach, anxious to render what assistance they could to those who 
were
suffering from the fury of the storm.

     We have before mentioned that a boat that the Baron Stolmuyer saw
swamped, had ventured out to the assistance of the crew.

     In that boat had been Jack Pringle; and he had refused to allow the old
sailor to accompany him, on account of his age.

     "No, no," said Jack: "this is a work for youngsters, and they and they
only ought to set about it.  You remain where you are.  We know well enough
that your will is good, and let that be sufficient; and now, my lads, who 
will
go with me?"

     Jack soon got a few good volunteers, and started out on his chivalrous
expedition, to see what could be done towards rescuing some of the crew of 
the
distressed ship.

     But, alas! what the baron had said about the fate of that boat was 
true,
although he was incorrect as regarded the consequences of its swamping to 
all
on board; for Jack Pringle, in consequence of being a first-rate swimmer, 
and
possessed likewise as he was of great coolness and presence of mind, 
contrived
to reach shore again, although he was the only one of the ill-fated crew who
really did so.

     But, as Jack himself said, they died in a noble cause, and as everybody
must die some time in some sort of way, he didn't see that they had anything
very particular to complain of in that respect.

     It was on the second occasion, however, that Jack was going out with a
life-boat, that the baron reached the beach, and then, as if indignant that
such daring attempts should be made to save what he evidently thought so
little of, namely, human life, he retired in indignation again to his home.

     But not all the barons in the world would have stopped Jack in his
chivalrous enterprize, and so he proceeded at once to carry it out to the 
best
of his ability; and he did pick up a man who was nearly exhausted, and
clinging, with but a faint hope of deliverance, to a portion of wreck.

 Next Time: The Young Sailor Saved by Jack Pringle Turns Out to be an
 Important Personage.




                                CHAPTER CVII.

THE YOUNG SAILOR SAVED BY JACK PRINGLE TURNS OUT TO BE AN IMPORTANT 
PERSONAGE.


     It was not the least gratifying part by any means of Jack Pringle's,
going to the sea-side, that, in consequence of that occurence, he had been
instrumental in saving the life of a fellow-creature; and when he returned 
to
the cottage of the fisherman, bearing in his arms the apparently lifeless
remains of a young man, who had been clinging to a portion of the wreck, the
cheer that greeted him from the bystanders was certainly the most grateful
music that had ever greeted his ears.

     He had a strong impression on his own mind, that the young man whom he
had removed from the wreck would recover, and that impression he was
wonderfully well pleased to find verified by the fact.

     The care and assiduity of the family, upon whose hospitality the young
stranger was thus by the fury of the elements thrown, succeeded shortly in
restoring him to perfect consciousness.

     He showed a disposition, then, to arise, but this Jack Pringle and the
old fisherman would not permit, for they both knew from experience in such
cases, how essential rest was; so they darkened the room in which he lay, 
and
left him to himself.

     "Well," said Jack, as they sat together; "what do you think of that 
young
fellow?  I cannot, for my own part, make out very well what he is, although 
I
can say what he is not, and that's a seaman."

     "No, he is no sailor, certainly; and he is more likely to have been a
passenger on board the merchantman, than anything else; and if so, it's an 
odd
thing that he should have been the only one saved out of the ship's crew, 
when
there much have been men used to such disasters, and one would think capable
of taking care of themselves."

     "It is an odd thing; but there is no accounting for it; we shall hear 
all
about it, though, when he recovers sufficiently to speak to us without doing
himself any mischief."

     "Certainly; and that will be after he has had a sleep, for then he will
be all right; for, mind you, I don't think he was insensible on account of
having been in the water so much, as because he was so thoroughly tired out,
that he didn't know what he was about."

     The stranger slept for about four hours; and then he awakened, greatly
refreshed by the slumber, and quite able to give some account of himself
without fatigue.

     After expressing his most grateful thanks for the service that had been
rendered to him, to which Jack listened with great impatience, because he
really did not consider it a service at all, but one of the most natural
things in the world for a man to do, who saw another in distress, he said, -
-

     "I was captain's clerk on board a king's ship called the Undine, and we
had a smart affair with a nest of pirates on the African coast.  We were
absolutely attacked by four or five of their vessels at once, and, having 
sunk
three and captured the remainder, during which, however, we lost some 
officers
and a number of men, our captain determined upon sending home a dispatch of
the transaction, which he entrusted to my care."

     "Hang pirates!" said Jack.  "They ought all to be hung up at the yard-
arm, without judge or jury; but, I suppose, they are by this time pretty 
well
settled."

     "I have no doubt of it, for it was the captain's intention to steer to
the nearest port, and there be evidence against them, and get them in due
course executed.  He put me on board a merchant vessel with my dispatches, 
and
a more prosperous and pleasant voyage we could not have, until the storm 
which
arose off the coast here, and proved the destruction of our vessel."

     "Ah!" said Jack, "it's always the case, if anything happens, it's 
within
sight almost of the port you are bound to."

     "So it is," said the old fisherman.  "All is safe out in the blue 
waters;
but, when you least expect it, and things are looking quite pleasant, and
people a-brushing themselves up to go on shore, then, all of a sudden,
something will occur, and you will find yourselves a wreck."

     "It would seem so," said the young stranger; "and, at all events, that
was our evil fortune, whatever it may be any one else's, for we were, 
indeed,
just congratulating ourselves upon being at home, or nearly so, when this
terrific storm arose, and, I suppose, I am the only survivor out a crew of
twenty-eight men."

     "The only one," said Jack, "I am sorry to say.  All had sunk before the
life-boat had reached you, and, what's more, several brave fellows lost 
their
lives in the first attempt to pick up some of the crew; so it has been a 
most
disastrous matter altogether."

     "But cheer up," said the fisherman; "it might have been worse, for I 
have
known cases when a ship has gone down, and not left one survivor to say who 
or
what she was; or tell the tale of her destruction."

     "And I too," said Jack.

     "On what part of the coast," said the stranger, "am I? for, during the
night, we have drifted so far, and been so beaten about by the gale, that
whether we came twenty miles or a hundred I cannot tell."

     "Why, the town close at hand here is called Anderbury."

     "Anderbury!" exclaimed the young man.  "Is it possible that my 
faculties
have been so confused by the danger I have been in, as not to know this 
coast.
 This is the very place to which I should have proceeded post-haste, 
directly
I concluded my business in London at the Admiralty."

     "Indeed.  Then you had better stay here at once, and go to the 
Admiralty
afterwards; for, I dare say, that will answer the purpose just as well, at 
all
events.  And, I suppose, you have lost your dispatches."

     "I have, indeed; but yet it is my duty to report myself, as soon as
possible.  But, now that I am in Anderbury, I cannot resist the opportunity 
of
 calling upon a dear friend, who resides in this town.  Do you happen to 
know
a family of the name of Williams?"

     "No," said Jack; "I never heard of them, except you mean a Bill 
Williams,
that was once on board the Ocean frigate, as cook."

     "No, no.  I mean a family residing here, one of the members of which is
dearer to me than life itself."

     "Well," said Jack, "it's good fortune that has cast you here, since 
that
is the case.  It is not likely that I should know anything of the people you
speak of, because I am a stranger in the place myself, and have come a
distance of twenty-five miles, just to have a look at the sea, and nothing
else, and good fortune brought me here in time, it appears, to save your 
life,
and I only hope you will find your sweetheart true to you."

     "I can have no doubt of that."

     "Well, it is a good thing to be confident; but, for my part, I always 
had
very serious doubts, and, when I came off a voyage, I frequently found that 
my
sweetheart had picked up with somebody else, in the course of about a week
after I was gone."

     "But, in this case," said the young stranger, "I would stake my life 
upon
the fidelity of her whom I wish so much now to see."

     "Well," said Jack, "of course you please yourself; but, before you make 
a
fool of yourself, by calling upon her, just satisfy yourself upon the 
subject,
that's all, and get some friend to make an inquiry for you, or else, 
perhaps,
you will be served as I was once."

     "How was that?"

     "Why, the fact is, when I was younger than I am now, I took a fancy to 
a
nice little creature, of the name of Jemima West, whom I fully intended to
marry, and so I told her, before I started upon one voyage that I meant to 
be
my last; for, you see, I had a pretty good stock of prize money, and I meant
to set up a public-house at Liverpool."

     "And did she prove false to you?"

     "A little.  When I came home, of course I walked off straight to where
she lived.  Her father and mother were very respectable people, and amused
themselves with selling coals and potatoes.  So, in I walked, as I used to 
do,
into the shop, and so on, bang into the parlour, and there sat Jemima, much 
as
usual, neither very clean, and neither very dirty.  Well, on the other side 
of
the fire-place was a fellow smoking a pipe, and, when I caught hold of her,
and gave her half-a-dozen regular kisses, he takes his pipe out of his 
mouth,
and opens his eyes like an old crocodile.

     "'Well, my girl,' I said; 'how are you?'

     "'Oh, I don't know,' she said; 'I didn't expect to see you any more.'

     "'No,' said the fellow, with the pipe, 'and I'm d--d if ever I expected
to see you at all.  Who the devil are you?'

     "'Who the devil are you?' says I; 'but, however, that don't much 
matter,
for be you whom you may, if you don't pretty quick take yourself off, I'll
kick you out.'

     "'That's a good joke,' says he, 'to talk of kicking a man out of his 
own
house, after coming in and kissing his wife like a steam-engine.  A very 
good
joke.'

     "'Wife!' says I.  'Do you say you are this fellow's wife?'

     "'Yes,' says she, and she pretended to wipe something out of the corner
of her eye with her apron. 'Yes,' says she; 'I thought you were drowned long
ago, and so I thought I might as well be Mrs. Juggles.'

     "Now you may guess, messmate, what a d--d fool I looked after that, and
how glad I was to back out; so, you see, I advise you to make some inquiries
just before you take upon yourself to be so positive about your sweetheart."

     The young man laughed, as he said, --

     "I think I'll chance it; and, notwithstanding your misadventure, I have
some reason to believe that I shall not be so unfortunate; but at all events 
I
will take your advice and make some previous inquiries.  It shall not be 
said
that I fell into any misadventure of that nature for want of ordinary
caution."

     "That's right, don't be above taking advice; and, do you know, I 
sha'n't
be at all surprised, that you will find your sweetheart going to be Mrs.
Somebody else; but come, here's dinner will be ready directly."

     "Yes," said the old man; "it will as soon as my son returns from
Anderbury, where he has gone to buy a bit of fresh meat for you, for I 
thought
you would be tired of fish, and we had nothing else in the house."

     "I regret much giving you so much trouble; but I shall have my pay to
receive when I reach London, and will take care that you are amply
recompensed."

     "Oh, don't mention that; and, by-the-bye, here he comes.  Well, Tom, 
what
have you brought?"

     "A leg of mutton," said Tom; "I ain't a judge of nothing else, but I
thought I might venture upon that, at all events.  I think somebody told me 
it
was very good with shrimp sauce."

     "Rather an odd mixture, that, Tom, and not quite usual I should say."

     "Well, the fellow was on the grin that told me, on account of an old
woman that had been to them to ask for some more credit for a month or two,
because her daughter was going to be married to a baron somebody, who they 
say
has taken Anderbury-on-the-Mount, and is immensely rich."

     "Did you hear her name, Tom?"

     "Oh, yes; I have seen her before in the town.  It's old Mother 
Williams,
and it's her daughter Helen as is going to be married."

     "Well, I never!" cried Jack; "I say, messmate, didn't I tell you?  The
murder is out, now; that's your sweetheart, ain't it?"

     The young man turned very pale, and for a few moments he did not speak;
but when he did so, he said, --

     "There must be some mistake; I could stake my life upon her constancy."

     "Then a precious goose you would be," said Jack, "to do any such thing,
for I wouldn't stake my little finger upon any woman.  Why, man, it's just
what you ought to have expected.  It's the way with them all, out of sight 
out
of mind, and I am only surprised at a fellow of your sense not knowing that,
for you seem to be up to a thing or two."

     "It cannot be-- it cannot be-- I must go myself to seek Helen, and at
once put a stop to these rumours, which, I am convinced, arise from some
misconstruction, and probably a confusion of names.  I know that Mrs. 
Williams
is a selfish woman, and it is possible that she might not hesitate in
sacrificing one of her daughters to gold, but that one cannot be Helen, who
has pledged her faith to me."

     "Well," said Jack, "take advantage of any doubt you can, but it would 
be
very absurd for you to go interfering in the matter yourself.  You leave it 
to
me to make the necessary inquiries, whilst you remain here snug and unknown,
and I promise you, on the word of a British seaman, that I'll bring you 
exact
news all about it."

     "I accept your offer gratefully, for if she be faithless to me, I wish
never to encounter her again, but to leave her to enjoy what happiness she 
can
with that other for whom she has broken her faith with me."

     "Good," said Jack; "that's the wisest plan, for, after all, you see, in
these affairs who's to blame but the girl herself? and you can't very well
give her a thrashing, you know; for, as regards the fellow, of course, she
don't say anything to him about you, and he can't tell but what she is a
regular free trader."

     "True-- true-- and the best thing, therefore, I can do, to make certain
of controlling my temper in the transaction, is not to see her, unless I can
make certain that she is faithful to the vows she has plighted to me; but 
let
me beg of you, as quickly as possible, to end my state of suspense and 
doubt."

     "I believe you," said Jack; "I'll go at once to find it all out.  You
sha'n't be in doubt much longer, and, of course, I hope that things will 
turn
out to your satisfaction; although I can't say I expect they will."

     "The hope that they will, is life itself to me, and I shall wait here
with an impatience bordering upon positive agony for your report."

 Next Time: The Decision Against the Doctor, and More News of Varney, the
 Vampyre.




                               CHAPTER CVIII.

THE DECISION AGAINST THE DOCTOR, AND MORE NEWS OF VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE.


     It will be remembered that Dr. Chillingworth, although he had, without
doubt, ascertained that Varney had proceeded to London, hesitated about
following him there without the full connivance and consent of the
Bannerworths; and now, at the very first opportunity he had, when he found 
the
admiral and Henry together, he introduced the subject.

     He detailed what he had already done in the way of tracing Varney from
place to place, and ended by declaring his conviction the he was to be found
in London.

     "It is not only of importance," he said, "to discover Varney on account
of the property which I think he has taken with him, but it really amounts
almost to a public duty to do so, when we consider the evil he has succeeded
in bringing upon us, and that some other family may be soon suffering from
similar machinations."

     "But, doctor," said Henry, "I presume you have no disinclination to 
admit
that the principal view you take of this subject, is as regards its 
connexion
with the supposed sum of money which Varney has taken with him?"

     "I freely own," said the doctor, "that I should like to place that 
money
in your hands, because I think you are entitled to it; and, perhaps, that is
my principal motive, but it certainly is not my only one; for, as I consider
Varney quite a curiosity in a medical point of view, I certainly wish to
follow him up, and should be extremely sorry to lose sight of him 
altogether."

     "But you must be aware, doctor," said Henry, "that there really is
something like positive danger in following such a man up; and, although he
feels himself under such great obligations to you, that I do not think he
would willingly do you an injury, yet there is no knowing what so strange 
and
irascible a temper might not be goaded to."

     "I have no dread of danger."

     "I dare say you have not," said the admiral; "but I give my vote 
against
having anything further to do with Varney."

     "And," said Henry, "although I cannot withhold an expression of
admiration for the doctor's perseverance, I beg him to think that we oppose
his pilgrimage in search of the vampyre, because we fell more for his 
personal
safety than we fear any of the machinations of Varney."

     "Well, gentlemen," said the doctor, "since I am in a minority, of 
course
I must give in, and say no more about it.  I should certainly have liked to
find the fellow; for it is my impression that he certainly has a good many
thousands of your money in his possession.  But, as it is, I will say no 
more
about it; although I shall retain my opinion that you are ill-advised in not
following him up."

     "Oh," said the admiral, "it wouldn't do to follow people up always."

     "I don't know that.  There's that Quaker, for instance, who has got
possession of Dearbrook."

     "The Quaker!" shouted the admiral.  "D--n the Quaker!  I'll follow him 
up
while I have a guinea left, or a leg to stand on.  What the deuce made you
mention him? for you know the very sound of his name is enough to put me in 
a
fever.  The Quaker be hanged, an infernal thief as he is!"

     It was well known to both Henry and the doctor, and, in fact, to all 
the
family now, that the mention of the Quaker was always enough to drive the
admiral nearly frantic; so that we are inclined to think Dr. Chillingworth 
was
actuated by a little spirit of vengeance when he made that remark, and that,
on the whole, he was so vexed at the non-participation of the Bannerworths 
and
the admiral in his views concerning Sir Francis Varney, that, on the
irritation of the moment, he did not scruple to say something which he 
thought
would be annoying; but his downright good feeling so got the better of
anything of that sort, that, turning to the admiral, he said, --

     "I do apologise-- I ought to apologise for my calling to your attention
anything of a disagreeable character; for I have no right whatever to do so;
and it was only upon the impulse of a moment, I assure you, that I uttered 
the
words."

     "Doctor," said the admiral, "I know all that as well as you can tell 
me;
so just say no more about it, if you please, for I don't want to hear one 
word
upon such a subject."

     "Well, then," said the doctor, "now that I stand acquitted of doing or
saying anything of a doubtful or disagreeable character, I can only tell you
that I shall persevere in my opinion, and that it is just possible, though 
not
very likely, that I may, upon my own account, do something in the matter."

     "All of which," said Henry, "I am very sorry to hear you say, doctor."

     "But why are you sorry?"

     "Because I cannot help anticipating danger.  I feel almost certain that
it will ensue, and, in that case, no one will more bitterly regret that you
mixed yourself up in the affair than I shall."

     "Oh, do not presume any such thing," said the doctor, jestingly.  "You
may depend Varney and I understand each other too well for there to be much
danger in my intercourse with him.  There is something about the fellow yet
that will not permit him to do any deliberate wrong to me; and, strange as 
the
feeling may appear, I cannot help acknowledging that I like him in some
things, and that, having been the means of restoring him to life, I feel,
somehow or another, as if I were bound to look after him."

     "Well, that is rather absurd," said the admiral, "I must confess.  But,
however, doctor, if you have any such feeling, by all means carry it out-- I
won't say nay; but by any means find him out, if you like, and if you can 
make
him a decent member of society, in Heaven's name do so."

     "I do not expect that," said the doctor; "and if I only keep him out of
mischief, I shall be sufficiently satisfied, for that would be accomplishing 
a
great deal with such a man."

     "Promise me one thing," said Henry, "in connection with this affair."

     "What may that be?"

     "It is that you will not take any step in the matter without letting us
know.  Of course, you are a free-agent in the transaction, and have as much
right as anybody to say or to do anything as regards Varney, the vampyre; 
but
still, knowing so much of him as we do, I, for one, certainly would be glad 
to
be made aware of anything you were attempting concerning him."

     "That I will promise you, so you need be under no possible apprehension
on such a score, but feel completely at your ease that nothing is being done
unless you know of it."

     At this juncture, a servant entered the room with a letter, which was
addressed to Henry Bannerworth, and, upon opening it, he uttered a sudden
exclamation of suprise.

     "What is it?" said the admiral; "you seem astonished, Henry."

     "I am, indeed, astonished, and I may be.  Who do you suppose, admiral,
this letter is from?"

     "I can't possibly take upon myself to say."

     "Why, from no other person than Varney, the vampyre."

     "Indeed!" cried Dr. Chillingworth; "and does he offer restitution? --
does he offer to return the money he so wrongfully has got possession of? --
tell me that."

     "I cannot answer you, for I have not read one word of the epistle; I 
only
see by the signature that it is his; but as it is impossible that there can 
be
any secrets between myself and Varney, I shall read it to you aloud, and you
shall both of you be able to judge concerning it."

     The admiral and the doctor assumed attitudes of attention, while Henry,
after glancing his eyes slightly down the contents of the letter, commenced
reading it as follows: --

     "To Henry Bannerworth.

     "Sir, -- Probably the last person in the world from whom you might 
expect
to receive a communication, is he who now pens this epistle; but as it is
penned with a good feeling towards you and yours, I hope and trust it will 
be
received in a kindly spirit.

     "Admitting that the circumstances under which I left the protection of
your house were such as to require some explanation from me, it is that
explanation which I now proceed to give.

     "Circumstances made it imperatively necessary that I should adopt a
course of conduct that should no longer make me a burden to those who had 
more
cause to wish me dead, than to assist me in maintaining existence.

     "Without, then, the least sinister motive towards you or any one
belonging to you, I left your home secretly, and at once, not being willing 
to
listen to remonstrances that I knew would be spoken kindly, but which I knew
at the same time could not be very serious, inasmuch as my presence cannot
possibly be otherwise than a severe tax upon your kindness and your 
patience.

     "I cannot be so besotted as to think for a moment, that you can forget,
although a generosity of temper, for which I give you full credit, might
enable you to forgive, the injuries you have received from me; but I could 
not
make up my mind to reside under your roof on such terms; and since my 
recovery
from the violence of a lawless mob, the question in my mind has been, not
whether I should leave you or not, but how I should leave you, and where I
should betake myself to.

     "At length, finding it impossible to come to any rational conclusion 
upon
these points, and that time was rapidly wearing, so that it became 
necessary,
if I came to a conclusion at all, I should come to it quickly, I resolved to
leave without giving you any notice of the fact, and set up my staff, as it
were, in the wilderness, and proceed in whatever direction chance might 
point
out to me.

     "This, I say, was my resolve, and I have carried it into execution.  
All
I ask of you is, to forget me, and not to waste any thought upon the man who
will never do any injury to you, or to any one belonging to you, and who 
hopes
you will make no inquiry for him; but, should you meet him ever, you will 
pass
him by as if you knew him not.

     "These few words come from him who was       "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE."

     There was a dead silence when this epistle was concluded, and all 
seemed
busy with their own opinions as regarded this communication, which certainly
was one of a singular nature, and highly calculated to excite their 
surprise.

     Upon the whole, though, there was one extremely evident conclusion to 
be
drawn from it, and that was, that Varney was extremely anxious not to be
interfered with.

     "Can anything be more transparent?" exclaimed the doctor; "it is just 
as
I say, Varney wants to try some new scheme, and is very much afraid that he
may come across us in some way, and be baulked in it, by our exposing what 
his
real character is; and, if anything could give me a stronger impulse than
another to follow him and see what he is about, it would certainly be that
letter."

     "I do not think you need be afraid," said Henry; "for the letter, 
bearing
as it does that signification, is such a one as induces me to believe he is
fearful that some circumstances may throw him in our way, and in that case,
that we may spoil his sport; and of the likelihood of such a thing 
occurring,
he is, of course, a much better judge than we can be.  So I should say, let
him alone, and see if anything really turns up concerning him; if it does, 
we
have a fair principle action before us, for we have no occasion, merely
because he has asked us, to be quiet and peaceable, if we find himi playing
any pranks, or attempting to play any pranks."

     "That's my opinion, too," said the admiral; "be quiet and take no 
notice,
and it will be an odd thing to me, then, if you don't soon hear something of
Master Varney, and that may be a something, too, that may astonish us."

     "It that all the letter?" said Dr. Chillingworth.

     "Yes, with the exception of these words in a postscript, --

     "Any communication addressed to V. V., General Post-office, London, 
will
reach my hands promptly."

     "Ah! then there's the gist of the matter," said the doctor; "the 
vagabond
wants to be assured that we shall not interfere with him; and then he has 
got
some rascality in hand, you may depend, which he would set to work about in
real earnest."

     "I shall not write to him," said Henry, "but shall pursue quite a
different course of policy, and wait patiently for what may happen, for I am
convinced that is the only plan to pursue with any chance of benefit or
success."

     "And you will bear in mind, doctor," said the admiral, "that the fellow
in this letter talks of giving us an explanation, and yet not one word does 
he
say about jumping upon your back from the garden-wall.  The deuce a bit does
he explain that."

     "No," said the doctor; "nor did I expect he would.  Such a man as 
Varney
is not likely to criminate himself; and, while there is a doubt about 
whether
he is that person or not, you may depend he will not be the man to take any
pains to dispel it."

     "Of course not-- of course not."

     "Well," said the doctor, "I can only tell you all one thing, and that 
is,
that, whatever you may think or flatter yourselves, this affair is very far
indeed from being over, and sooner or later, something yet very serious will
occur in connection with Varney, the vampyre.  Do not fancy that you have 
got
rid of him, for, most certainly, you have not."

     The doctor spoke these words so oracularly, that they sounded extremely
like one of those predictions founded upon such a firm basis, that they are
sure to be carried out by future facts, and both Henry and the admiral felt 
as
if they had heard truth from some one who knew well what he was uttering, 
and
was not likely to be mistaken.

 Next Time: The Preparations for the Wedding of the Baron Stolmuyer of
 Saltzburgh.




                                CHAPTER CIX.

THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE WEDDING OF THE BARON STOLMUYER OF SALTZBURGH.


     There is a common adage which inculcates the necessity of striking 
while
the iron is hot, and this was an adage which, to judge from her conduct,
seemed to have made a great impression upon the mind of Mrs. Williams, and 
she
thought that, as regarded her daughter's feelings, the iron was hot, and 
that,
if she struck now, she might be able to wring from her a consent, no matter
how reluctant, to call the Baron Stolmuyer her husband.

     The objects which Mrs. Williams felt certain she should succeed in
achieving by such an union in her family, were far too weighty to be easily
dispensed with.  They not only comprehended the five hundred pounds which 
the
baron had so judiciously promised her upon the wedding day being fixed, but
she had an eye to after circumstances, and considered that the son-in-law 
who
could spare five hundred pounds, as a mere bribe to her, would be an endless
source, from whence she could draw her pecuniary supplies.

     "And then," thought Mrs. Williams, "there are the other girls to get 
off,
too, and what a famous opportunity it will be to do that, when they can be 
at
all the grand parties the baron will give at Anderbury House."

     To an intriguing woman, such as Mrs. Williams was in reality, all these
advantages appeared in full force; and, if ever she made up her mind
thoroughly and entirely about anything in the world, she certainly did that
her daughter Helen should be the Baroness Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh.

     She certainly wished, in her own heart, that the baron had chosen one 
of
her other daughters, because then she knew that she would not have had to
encounter the opposition she had done, and, perhaps, had still to encounter,
in the case of Helen; but, as it was, that part of the business could not be
helped, and she, Helen, was to be sacrificed.

     If the baron had thought for twelve-months over the matter, he could 
not
have come to a better conclusion, as to the best means of making Mrs. 
Williams
a zealous partisian of his, than by distinctly naming a sum of money that 
she
should have, and when she should have it, for now she considered that each
moment's delay was a piece of actual criminality on the part of Helen,
inasmuch as it was keeping her, Mrs. Williams, out of a large sum of money.

     There was one thing, however, which she did at once; and that was to go
to the different tradespeople who had had the awful insolence to stop the
supplies, and tell them that her daughter Helen was about to become the
Baroness Stolmuyer, and that, if they continued to execute orders, and to 
wait
with patience, they would all get paid within one month.

     This positive announcement staggered some of them, for they would 
hardly
have thought it possible that she would have made it, if there had not been
some great foundation for truth in it, of some sort, and it was one of these
announcements which, as the reader is aware, had been overheard by Tom, the
son of the old sailor, and which, when reported, had created so much
consternation in the mind of the young man who had been saved by Jack 
Pringle
from the wreck.

     On the following morning, the lady received a laconic note from the
baron, in which were the words: --

     "Madam, -- Have you settled with your daughter the day and hour of my
nuptials with her?  I have drawn a cheque in your favour, and only wait your
further proceeding in the affair to sign it, and send it to you.

     "I have the honour to be, madam, yours truly,                
"STOLMUYER.

     "Mrs. Williams."

     This note put Mrs. Williams into a perfect fury of impatience.  The 
idea,
that actually a cheque for five hundred pounds should be drawn in her 
favour,
and only awaiting the signature of the baron, and that, by one word, her
daughter Helen could procure that signature, was absolutely maddening.

     She rushed, at once, to Helen's room.

                  *             *             *             *

     Poor Helen knew enough of her mother to feel convinced, from the first,
that no possible exertion would be spared for the purpose of forcing her 
into
that marriage, which had no charms, alas, for her, but which, on the 
contrary,
presented itself to her in the most hideous of all possible aspects.

     From the first moment that her mother had broached it, it had seemed in
its remembrance to lie at her heart like a lump of lead.  She seemed already
to feel that, after an unavailing resistance, she would have to yield, and
then that her future existence would involve in it all the pangs of despair
and regret.

     "Alas-- alas!" she said; "under what fatal planet was I born, that I
should be so unhappy as I now am?  What will become of me, and how shall I
gather resolution enough either to bear with seeming patience the fate that
afflicts me, or to resist the machinations of my mother, who would force me 
to
wed this man whom I cannot love."

     The long absence of her lover was so perplexing a source of woe and
reflection to her, that already it had sapped much of the joy of her young
existence.

     "He surely ought," she said, "and might have found some means of
communicating to me long ere this.  He might well know, and must know, that
suspense is, of all feelings, the worst to bear.  Oh! why am I thus deserted
by all, and left to the mercy of the worst of circumstances?"

     With her sisters, poor Helen could have no sympathies in common; either
of them would have been delighted to change places with her, as regarded the
fact of becoming the Baroness of Saltzburgh, and they had towards her a
tolerably cordial ill-will, on account of her superior charms, which made 
her
so much admired, while they were left to "pine in maiden meditation fancy
free."

     But to Helen Williams, this gift of beauty was what it truly has often
been described-- a most dangerous one, and she would have given the world to
have been able to wear an appearance that would have repelled, instead of
attracted, the Baron Stolmuyer.

     She was in this desponding state of mind, revolving in her mind her
dismal prospects, if she should consent to wed the baron, and her equally
dismal ones if she should refuse -- for well she knew how painful a position
with her family such a refusal would place her in -- when her mother entered
the room.

     Mrs. Williams had so thoroughly determined that this marriage should 
take
place, that she could not be said to have now sought her daughter to 
persuade
her to it; but, on the contrary, to insist upon it.  The sisters, too, with
whom this unnatural mother -- or rather, perhaps, we ought to say, too
natural, but too common mother -- had held a conversation upon the subject,
were anxious, despite their jealousy upon the occasion, that the affair 
should
proceed, because certainly the next best thing to themselves making such an
alliance was to succeed in getting it made by some other of the family, and
they fully intended making Anderbury-on-the-Mount their home.

     "What, Helen!" exclaimed Mrs. Williams -- "in tears as usual!"

     "Have I not cause for weeping, mother?"

     "Well, well; I cannot say much to you beyond the few words I have come 
to
say.  I have, I fear, as regarded this affair of the offer that was made to
you by the Baron Stolmuyer, behaved precipitately."

     "Oh, mother," cried Helen, with renewed hope, "I am rejoiced to hear 
you
say so.  Then you will not now ask me to sacrifice myself to a man whom I 
can
never love?  Say no more of the past.  It is sufficient that you have 
awakened
to better resolves now, dear mother, and I shall be happy."

     Such words as these ought to have softened the mother's heart; but such 
a
woman had no heart to soften; and, after a pause, she proceeded in her plan 
of
operations.

     "Well my dear, perhaps it is all for the best."

     "It must be for the best, mother, because it never can be for good that 
I
should have consented to plight my vows to one whom, of all others, I 
cannont
look upon with the least affectionate regard.  Indeed, mother, so much as I
can absolutely dislike any one, I dislike that man."

     "There's no occasion to say anything more about it, my dear.  I have 
come
to bid you farewell, and Heaven only knows when we may meet again."

     "What do you mean, mother?"

     "I mean, my dear, just what I say; I am going now at once to a prison."

     "A prison?"

     "Yes.  It certainly is not an agreeable idea; but, as I told you, I was
too sanguine, and built too much upon your consenting to marry the baron, so 
I
borrowed a sum of money to pay some pressing debts; but as I have not been
able to repay it, I am arrested, and have now only persuaded the man to go
away upon giving him my solemn promise that I will, in half-an-hour's time, 
be
at the gates of the town gaol."

     Helen heard this declaration with a feeling of perfect horror.  She was
too little acquainted with the usages of society to see what a transparent 
lie
it really was, and, to her mind, it did not appear improbable that a man who
came to arrest anybody should take their word to come to the gaol in half-
an-
hour.

     "Oh! mother, mother," she sobbed, "can this be?"

     "I don't know," said Mrs. Williams, "if it can be or not.  All I know 
is,
that it is so, and that I am perfectly willing to pass the reaminder of my
days in a dungeon."

     Helen's ideas of prisons were all procured from romances, and she was 
not
at all surprised, consequently, to hear her mother talk of a dungeon; and if
she had added something about chains, and bread and water, and a heap of 
straw
merely for a bed, it would have found a ready credence with poor Helen.

     No wonder, therefore, that the idea of such a catastrophe presented
itself to her in the most terrific colours; and she saw at once all her 
recent
congratulations upon an escape from a marriage with the Baron Stolmuyer of
Saltzburgh scattered to the winds of Heaven.

     She was so petrified with astonishment and grief, that for some moments
she could not speak, and Mrs. Williams took care to improve upon that 
silence
by adding, --

     "I am sure I should be the last person in the world to ask any daughter
of mine to make a sacrifice; but as I have been so foolish, because I took a
pride in my family, as to go into expenses I cannot stand, why, of course, I
must take the consequences."

     "Oh! no, no."

     "Oh! it's all very well to say, 'Oh! no, no,' but it's oh! yes, yes; 
and
all I have to ask of you now is, to say that business has compelled me to
leave this part of the country, and after that, the best way will be to say
that I am dead."

     "Heaven help me!"

     "And then, of course," continued Mrs. Williams, in the most martyr-like
and self-denying tone in all the world; "and then, of course, people will
leave off making any inquiries about me, and you may all of you in time
manange to forget me likewise."

     "Mother, mother, is not this cruel?"

     "My dear, I really cannot say that I think it is.  I am, and have been,
mistaken, and perhaps I did push the affair of your marriage with the Baron
Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh a little too far, and too much counted upon it.  I
know I am apt to be too sanguine-- I am well aware of that.  It's a little
peculiarity of mine, but I cannot help it; and when we have those little
peculiarities, all we can do, is to put up with it as best we may."

     "But, mother ----."

     "Oh! it's no use talking."

     "Is the creditor so very inexorable?"

     "Yes, and only on one account; he thinks I have deceived him, that't 
the
fact; and having asked me to give a decided answer if the wedding-day was
fixed between you and the baron, for nothing else would satisfy him, and as 
of
course I could not say that, he got quite furious, and at once threatened me
with law proceedings, which I did not think he really meant; but it appears 
he
did, for here I am arrested."

     "But can nothing be done?"

     "Not that I see.  The baron, when he made the proposal, was anxious for
an immediate reply, and then he would have made some very handsome 
settlement,
which would have been soon known, and anybody would have trusted me.  But as
it is, the only thing that can save you all, will be for me to go to prison 
at
once, and so disappear."

     Helen wept bitterly.

     "And therefore, my dear, I beg you won't think anything of it.  I am
quite willing to go at once, without any more fuss about it.  But I have not
yet said anything to your sisters, because I thought that the first
explanation was due to you in the affair, since you were the most mixed up
with it."

     "Oh! this is too dreadful-- much too dreadful!"

     "Farewell-- farewell.  We may meet again, or we may not.  I wish you 
all
manner of happiness."

     Mrs. Williams moved towards the door, but before she reached it, Helen
sprung after her, and detaining her, cried, --

     "No, no.  It must not be.  If there is an imperative necessity for some
victim, let me be it.  Oh! let me be it."

     "What do you mean, Helen?" asked Mrs. Williams, in pretended surprise.

     "I-- I mean, mother, that-- that I will, to save you, give up all hopes
of happiness in this world, and that although I would far rather go at once 
to
my grave, I will, since my destiny seems to point out that it must be so,
consent."

     "Consent to become the Baroness Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh, &c., &c.  Do I
hear aright?"

     "Yes, yes.  Heaven help me!  I feel that I have no other hope.  The
dreadful alternative that is presented to me, leaves me no other course to
pursue.  I must, and I do consent, if it will at once save you from the
prison."

     "It will, my dear, if I can succeed in convincing my importunate 
creditor
that you have really consented, and that it is not a scheme of mine merely 
to
escape a prison.  But if you write a few words signifying your consent, that
will be quite sufficient."

     This was an artful proceeding on the part of Mrs. Williams, for 
although
she by no means intended to put the baron in possession of such a document,
yet she considered that by having it, she completely protected herself from
any reproaches which he might otherwise cast upon her, should any hitch 
arise
in the proceedings, or anything go wrong with the affair, even at the last
moment.

     The few words in writing, which sufficed, as Mrs. Williams thought, 
fully
to commit poor Helen to the marriage, were freely written, for there was no
duplicity in the character of Helen, and what she said she would consent to,
she was quite willing to write.

     "Well, my dear," said Mrs. Williams, "although you don't feel happy 
just
now about the marriage, you may depend upon it you will enjoy your existence
very much; for when you get a little older, you will find that it is, after
all, the possession of ample means that is the most important thing to look
to."

     Helen shook her head, but she made no reply.  She did not at all agree
with what her mother said, but she felt by far too much depressed to argue 
the
point with her just then.

     "You will all your life," added Mrs. Williams, as she left the room,
"have the great consolation of knowing that you saved me from a prision, and
in so doing, absolutely saved my life, for although I did not say before, I 
am
quite sure I should have died."

 Next Time: Jack Pringle Calls Upon Mrs. Williams, and Tells Her a Piece of
 His Mind Upon Affairs in General.




                                CHAPTER CX.

JACK PRINGLE CALLS UPON MRS. WILLIAMS, AND TELLS HER A PIECE OF HIS MIND 
UPON
AFFAIRS IN GENERAL.


     Jack Pringle never promised anything without an intention of performing
it, whether he could succeed or not; and accordingly, when he promised that 
he
would make due and dilligent inquiry, for the purpose of ascertaining if 
Helen
Williams was indeed faithless, he proceeded at once to do so in the most
direct manner in the world, viz. by calling upon no less a personage than 
Mrs.
Williams herself, and popping the question to her in a manner which almost
precluded the possibility of her returning anything but a direct answer.

     This was a measure which few persons would have attempted; but having,
as it had, all the characteristcs of boldness about it, it was not one that 
he
was likely to fail in, but, upon the contrary, calculated in every respect 
to
be eminently successful.

     He proceeded to the town in perfect ignorance of its locality, or even 
of
the abode of Mrs. Williams, except so far as a very involved description had
been given to him of the route to her house by the old sailor's son, Tom, 
who
certainly was not the best hand in the world at a direction.

     But Jack was never at a loss, for, some how or another, by the force of 
a
good-tempered manner that he had, he contrived to make friends wherever he
went, and among them he soon found one who was willing in every respect to
take pains with him, and to walk with him to the door of Mrs. Williams.

     "Thank ye, messmate," said Jack; "and if ever I meet you again you may
make up your mind that you have met a friend.  And so this is Mrs. 
Williams's
is it?"

     "Yes," said the man; "this is Mrs. Williams's."

     "And what sort of a creature is she?"

     "Oh, why, as to that, she is not the sort of woman I like; but there is
no accounting for tastes, you know, and other people might like her very
well."

     "You are a sensible fellow," said Jack; "and I should say you have 
quite
wit enough about you, that if you fell into the fire you would get out again
as soon as you could."

     The man hardly knew whether to take this as a compliment or not; but at
all events he bade Jack good-day civilly enough, and took no notice of it.

     Jack then boldly knocked at the door, and when the one miserable 
servant
of the Williamses made her appearance, and asked him what he wanted, he
replied, --

     "Why, I have principally called to tell you what a remarkably fine girl
you are, and after that I should like to see mother Williams."

     "Go along with ye," said the girl; "you are only joking, and I can tell
you that missis would just as soon give you to a constable as look at you."

     "Oh, no, she wouldn't," said Jack; "for good-looking fellows are 
scarce,
and I dare say she knows that as well as possible, and she would much rather
keep me herself than give me to anybody."

     "Well, I'm sure!" said the girl.  "You are like all the rest of the 
men,
and have a pretty good opinion of yourself; but, if you really want to see
missis, I may as well tell her at once."

     "To be sure," said Jack.

     Mrs. Williams, from a room on the ground floor, had heard that some 
sort
of conversation was going on at the street door, and she called out --

     "Susan, Susan; how dare you be talking there to anybody!  Who is that, 
I
say-- tell me who that is immediately?"

     "It is me, ma'am," cried Jack.

     "And who is me?"

     "Why, ma'am, I have come on a delicate mission; I have got something to
say to you as is rather particular."

     Mrs. Williams's curiosity was excited, and perhaps some of her fears, 
for
when she had told Helen that she was drowned in debt, she had, 
hyperbolically
speaking, not far exceeded the truth, and therefore she dreaded refusing
seeing any one who came to ask for her, lest, smarting under the aggravation
of such a proceeding, the party, be he whom he might, should leave some
message that it would not be quite pleasant to her for Susan to hear.

     This was the respect, then, which placed Mrs. Williams positively at 
the
mercy of any one who chose to call upon her, and which induced her to give 
an
audience even to Jack Pringle, who, under ordinary circumstances, she would,
as Susan had correctly observed, have not scrupled to place in the hands of
some guardian of the public peace as an intruder into her house.

     When Jack was shown into the apartment where the lady waited to receive
him, he made what he considered a highly fashionable and elegant bow, which
consisted in laying hold of a lock of his hair in front, and giving it a
jerking pull at the same moment that he kicked out his foot behind and upset
a chair.

     "How do you do, ma'am?" said Jack.

     "You have the advantage of me," said Mrs. Williams.

     "I rather think I have," said Jack, "and I mean to keep it, and an-out
and out thing it would be if I hadn't, seeing the many voyages I have had,
when I dare say you was never out of sight of land in all your life."

     "I certainly never was," said Mrs. Williams; "and I hope I am speaking 
to
some officer, and not to anybody common."

     "Oh, yes, ma'am," said Jack; "I'm a rear-admiral of the green, and what 
I
come to ask you, is, if there is going to be a marriage in your family?"

     "Rather an eccentric character," thought Mrs. Williams; "but anybody 
may
see in a moment he is a gentleman, or else he would not be an admiral of the
green; I know there are admirals of all sorts of colours -- and so I have no
doubt he is quite correct.  Yes, sir, there is going to be a marriage in my
family, I am proud to say, for my daughter Helen is going to marry what 
might
be called quite a foreign potentate."

     "A foreign potato.  None of your gammon-- don't be poking your fun at
me."

     "A foreign potentate, I said, sir-- a kind of monarch-- a potentate, 
you
know."

     "Oh, I understands; I dare say them fellows lives on potatoes, and 
that's
why they calls them such.  But are you sure it's your daughter Helen, 
because
I was thinking of proposing for her myself?"

     "Really, then, Admiral Green, I am very sorry, but she is going to be
married to the Baron Stolmuyer, of Saltzburgh."

     "The baron what? did you say? Stonemason and Saltpot?  What a d---d odd
name, to be sure."

     "Dear me, what an eccentric character!" thought Mrs. Williams; "but 
quite
the gentleman.  Admiral Green, it's Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh is the baron's
name."

     "Oh, I knew it was something about salt; but, however, it don't matter;
and when is the ceremony to come off, ma'am?"

     "It is left to me, sir, to fix the day, and I shall do so, of course, 
at
my convenience; and I can only express my great regret, Admiral Green, that
you should have been too late; but, you see, the baron's offer was so
unexceptionable, and he is really quite a wealthy individual-- which his
offering me a cheque for five hundred pounds, is a convincing proof-- that I
really could not think of refusing him."

     "What! five hundred pounds?"

     "Yes; I assure you, Admiral Green, that he had pressed upon my 
acceptance
five hundred pounds."

     "The stingy devil."

     "Stingy!"

     "Rather.  Why, I meant to have asked you to accept of a couple of
thousands, and a large estate that I have got, which brings in as much every
year, and that I really don't want."

     "Two thousand pounds and a estate!  Gracious Providence!  I don't know
what to say to that; really Admiral Green, you are so very liberal, that, 
upon
my word, I am quite puzzled.  Two thousand pounds, and an estate worth two
thousand pounds a year! -- did you really mean that, Admiral Green?"

     "To be sure I did.  What else could I mean? but I don't want to 
interfere
with a foreign potato and a Baron Saltbox."

     "Well, but, my dear sir, stop a moment-- let me think."

     "No, ma'am," said Jack, "I ain't quite such a humbug as you takes me 
for. 
I say nothing, but it's very likely that your baron will turn out to be some
half-starved swindler who is going to wind up his affairs by doing you, and
sarves you right, too-- I wishes you good morning, ma'am"

     So saying, Jack, despite the remonstrances of Mrs. Williams, whose
cupidity was so strongly excited by what he had said, that she would gladly
have thrown overboard the baron, and who now began to look with something 
like
contempt upon the five hundred pounds which she had before thought was quite 
a
large sum.

     "How odd it is," she exclaimed, when she was alone; "how odd it is, 
that
after I have been looking about, I don't know how long, for a decent match 
for
some of the girls, all the men should come at once, and want Helen-- it's an
extraordinary thing to me, very extraordinary.  Dear me, if I could but have
secured Admiral Green for Juliana, and so got her married on the same day 
with
Helen, there would have been two thousand five hundred pounds for me at 
once. 
What a capital thing!  I would not have spoken of it to anybody, but I would
have paid all the tradespeople about here eightpence in the pound as a
composition, and then I could have gone and lived in London quite 
comfortably.

     Thus is it ever with such schemers as Mrs. Williams -- success brings
with it quite as many evils and distressful feelings as failure, and now the
agony of what she thought she had lost, much more than counterbalanced any
satisfaction she might have had in procuring her daughter's consent to the
marriage with the baron.

     This consent, although we know how it was wrung from Helen, we 
certainly
much blame her for giving, because no human power could really force her to
marry any one who was not her choice, and the mere fact that her mother
represented how deeply she was in debt, ought not to have been sufficient to
induce Helen to consent.

     She might and ought to have taken a much higher view of the subject -- 
a
view which should have excluded a consideration of James Anderson: that view
should have been a refusal to commit the perjury of solemny vowing before
Heaven to love and honour a man for whom she entertained such opposite
feelings.

     But Helen was not a close reasoner, and although all the argument was
upon her side, and all the propriety, and all the justice, we grieve to say
that she did not avail herself of either to the extent she ought to have 
done;
but, on the contrary, gave up those moments to regret which should have been
far better employed in resistance.

     When the consent which we have recorded had been wrung from her, she 
gave
herself up to the most melancholy reflections, weeping incessantly, and
calling upon Heaven to help her from the pressure of circumstances which she
was quite competent to relieve herself from, if she could have persuaded
herself to make the necessary efforts.

     At last it seemed to her that she had hit upon a plan which might 
afford
her some relief, but in projecting it, she little knew the real character of
the man she had to deal with.

     This scheme was to tell the baron candidly that she loved another, and,
whether that other was living of dead, his remembrance would so cling to 
her,
that she could never love another, and that, in making her his wife, he, the
baron, would be laying up for himself a source of regret and disquietude, in
the feeling that he possessed one whose affections he could never hope to
obtain.

     "Surely," thought Helen, "if he be at all human, and if he have any of
the natural pride of manhood about him, he will shrink from attempting to
continue a suit that must be mortifying in every one of its stages, and 
which
cannot confer upon him even the shadow of happiness."

 Next Time: The Wedding-Day Fixed, and the Guests Invited.




                                CHAPTER CXI.

THE WEDDING-DAY FIXED, AND THE GUESTS INVITED.


     When she was to receive so handsome a reward for the intelligence that
she had wrung a reluctant consent from Helen to be the baron's bride, it was
not likely that Mrs. Williams would let a long time elapse before she
communicated that fact to him, and, accordingly, she started to do so
personally.

     It would appear that the baron fully expected her, for he made no 
remark
at all expressive of surprise, but received her with that courtly grace 
which
Mrs. Williams attributed to his intercourse with the highest and the 
noblest.

     He did not seem so impatient as any one would have supposed a very 
ardent
lover would have been, and, before he would allow Mrs. Williams at all to
enter into the object of her visit, he requested her to be seated, and would
insist upon placing before her some of the very choicest refreshment.

     Indeed, as often as she then attempted to enter into the subject-matter
which had brought her there, he interrupted her with some remark of a
different nature, so that she found it very difficult to say anything
regarding it.

     At length, however, when he had satisfied the claims of hospitality, he
said, --

     "I presume that I shall have the pleasure of listening to something
particularly pleasant and delightful to me, inasmuch as it will convey to me
the realization of my dearest hopes."

     "Why, my lord baron, I must confess," said Mrs. Williams, "that
notwithstanding the extremely liberal offers of Admiral Green---"

     "Admiral Green, madam?  This is the first moment I have heard of such a
personage."

     "No doubt-- no doubt; but for all that, since we have had the honour of
your offer for the hand of Helen, Admiral Green has made one, and such a
liberal one that it's quite distressing to refuse him."

     "Then allow me to say, madam, that I hope you won't distress yourself
about it, but accept of Admiral Green at once.  I should be very sorry 
indeed
to stand in the way of any advantageous arrangement, and, therefore, I beg 
you
will close with Admiral Green."

     The adage about coming to the ground between two stools forcibly
presented itself to the memory of Mrs. Williams, and she replied, in a great
hurry, --

     "Oh, no, baron, certainly not-- certainly not.  I have refused the
admiral on your account.  I told him, most distinctly, I could not think of
entertaining his offer for a moment, and I refused him at once."

     "Then why trouble me about him, madam?"

     "Oh, I thought I would only merely mention it, because the admiral said
he would have great pleasure-- which, of course, was a very liberal thing of
him-- in handing me a cheque for two thousand pounds."

     "Oh, now I understand," said the baron.  "I give you credit, madam, for
having a good reason for making this report to me.  You think that I may be
induced to emulate the munificence of Admiral Green; but when I assure you
that I have not the remotest intention of so doing, probably you will think
that it would have been just as well if the matter had never been 
mentioned."

     The baron was right; for Mrs. Williams did think so; and she felt all
that bitterness of disappointment which wonderfully clever people do feel 
when
they find that some pet scheme has most signally failed, leaving behind it 
all
the consequences of a failure: and, whatever people may say to the contrary,
failures do always have bad consequences, and never leave the circumstances
exactly where they were.

     There was rather an awkward pause of some moments' duration, and then
Mrs. Williams thought she would get over the baron completely, for she put 
on
the most amiable smile she could, and said, --

     "My dear baron, I am sure we shall all be the most happy and united
family that can possibly be imagined; and it is the greatest pleasure to me 
to
be able to give you the intelligence that my daughter has consented to 
become
yours."

     "Madam, I am much obliged."

     "And, although Admiral Green did say that if I would bring him similar
intelligence he would there and then, on the spot, without any further 
delay,
hand me two thousand pounds, I said to him, -- 'Admiral Green, I am only to
get five hundred pounds from the Baron Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh, and that 
five
hundred pounds he has likewise promised to pay me down.'  Down-- you
understand, baron?"

     "Madam, I am not deaf."

     "But you understand-- down?"

     "Oh, I begin to see; you want the money.  Why could you not say so at
once?  It's of no use hinting things to me; but if you had said to me at 
once,
-- 'Baron, I have brought you the consent to the marriage, and now I expect
at once the five hundred pounds that I am to receive for so doing,' I should
have understood you, and said at once, -- 'Oh, certainly, madam; here is the
money,' -- as I do now.  You will find that check drawn for the amount."

     "What a charming thing it is," said Mrs. Williams; "what a charming 
thing
it is to do business in such a real business sort of way; but there are so 
few
people, baron, with your habits, and upon whom one can so thoroughly depend,
as one can upon you."

     "Madam, you do me too much honour.  Of course, having promised you this
insignificant sum of money, it was not likely that I should but keep my 
word;
and now let me ask, when is to be the happy day?"

     "If this day week will suit you, baron."

     "Wonderfully well, madam-- wonderfully well."

     "Then, we will consider that as settled.  I suppose you will have a
public marriage?"

     "No-- no, strictly private.  I am resolved, madam, not to have more 
than
one hundred and fifty people, and to keep the expenses within in a thousand
pounds; so you see, I am going to do it in the plainest possible manner, and
make no fuss at all about it."

     "Gracious Providence!" thought Mrs. Williams; "what would he call a
public marriage, if he considers a thousand pounds expense, and one hundred
and fifty guests, a private one, and making no fuss about it."

     "On one of my former marriages---" said the baron, with an air of
abstraction.

     "One of them?" said Mrs. Williams; "may I presume to ask how often you
have been married, my lord?"

     "Oh, certainly.  Let me see; I think eleven times."

     "Eleven! and pray, sir, what became of your wives?"

     "Why, really, madam, I cannot say.  I hope the majority of them went to
Heaven; but there were one or two I most heartily wished at the other 
place."

     "My gracious!" thought Mrs. Williams, "he is quite a bluebeard; but,
however, things have gone too far now; and I am not going to give up my 
cheque
if he had twenty wives; and, after all, it shows he must be a man of great
experience, and of great wealth, too, or so many women would not have had 
him;
but, if that little fact about all his wives should come to the ears of 
Helen,
I am really afraid she wouldn't have him, so I must caution him about it."

     "My lord baron."

     "Yes, madam."

     "I think, between you and I, my lord baron, that it would be quite as
well to say nothing to my daughter about her being the twelfth wife; but 
just
let her quietly think she is the first, because, you know, my lord, young
people have prejudices upon those subjects, and she might not exactly like 
the
idea."

     "Oh, certainly, madam, I shall not mention the little affairs that have
preceded her's.  I assure you I am quite aware that it is likely there 
should
be a prejudice against a man who has had eleven wives; and people will think
that he smothered a few of them."

     "Good gracious!" said Mrs. Williams; "you don't mean that, my lord 
baron. 
I hope that nobody ever accused you of such a thing."

     "Nay," said the baron; "how are the best of us to escape censure?  You
know as well as I, Mrs. Williams, what a bad world it is we live in; and how
dreadfully selfish people are."

     "Yes," said Mrs. Williams, "that's remarkably true; but it ain't often,
my lord baron, that one man has eleven wives."

     "No; and it ain't often that such a man would exactly like to venture
upon a twelfth."

     "Well, no, there is something in that; but I will now, my lord, take my
leave, entertaining no doubt whatever, but that this will be an extremely
happy marriage, and in every respect just what we might all of us desire."

     Mrs. Williams left the baron with these words; but, to say that she
believed them, would be to make by far too powerful an experiment upon the
credulity of our readers.

     When he was alone, the baron smiled a strange and ghastly smile.

     "That woman," he said, "is so fond of gold, that she sells her child
without hesitation to me.  If, upon hearing of my pretended marriages, she 
had
given me back my money, I should have thought some good of her; but no, that
she could not do.  Money is her idol, and when once in her possession, she
could not dream of parting with it.  But what is it to me?  Have I not made 
up
my mind to this affair, let the consequences be what they may?  Have I not
resolved upon it in every possible shape?  Henceforward I will cast aside 
all
feelings of regret, and live for myself alone; for what have I now to hope,
and what have I now to fear, from mankind?"

     "Hope! did I say I had nothing to hope?  I was wrong; I have something 
to
hope; and it is a something I will have-- it is revenge.  Yes, it is 
revenge--
revenge! which I must and will have against society, that has made me what I
am; and the time shall yet come when my name shall be a greater terror than 
it
is, and that to some were needless, for it is such a terror already, that 
but
to mention it, would cause a commotion of frightful inquietude."

     He looked from one of the windows of his house, and he saw Mrs. 
Williams,
as she proceeded down one of the garden walks, take his cheque from out her
reticule, where she had placed it, and look at it attentively.

     "Ah!" he said, "now she is worshipping her divinity, gold.  She knows
that that piece of paper carries weight with it, and that, flimsy as it 
looks,
it is sufficient to purchase her.  Fool! fool! and she thinks she is buying
contentment."

 Next Time: The Singular Invitation to the Baron's Wedding.




                               CHAPTER CXII.

THE SINGULAR INVITATION TO THE BARON'S WEDDING.


     About three days after the transactions which we have just recorded, 
the
admiral received a call from his friend, the attorney, and that call had a
double object.

     In the first place, the man of law wanted to tell him how he was
proceeding, as regarded the Quaker, and there they had a great tussel about
what was to be done, for, when the attorney said to him,

     "Now, admiral, as regards this assault upon Mr. Shepperd, all that can 
be
done is to let him prove his case, and then come up for judgment, and move 
in
the court in mitigation.  I dare say, you will dragged up to Westminster 
Hall
for judgment, and I should not at all wonder, but you will get off with a 
fine
of six-and-eightpence."

     "What do you mean," said the admiral, "by letting him do what he 
likes?"

     "In effect, it is the same thing as pleading guilty, you know, to a
charge brought against you, and, by so doing, you, to a great extent, disarm
justice."

     "Guilty!" roared the admiral; "guilty!  You will be a long time, 
indeed,
in convincing me that there is any guilt in kicking a Quaker, and especially
such a Quaker as Mr. Shepperd.  Why, I'll do it again, and think it, as I do
now, a meritorious action."

     "Yes; but you misunderstand me.  It's called guilt, you know, in law, 
to
do anything contrary to law; and, by pleading guilty, you do no more than 
just
admit the fact that you have kicked the Quaker."

     "That's quite another thing.  I have no objection to the fact, 
whatever,
but don't call it being guilty, for that's all moonshine, and I won't have 
it,
at any price.  Guilty be hanged!  I think I see it.  Guilty of kicking a
Quaker, indeed; I have half a mind to go and kick him again, just on 
purpose;
and I don't know but what I may do it yet."

     "Well, well, admiral, now that we have settled that knotty point, I 
have
got something else to tell you, of a more agreeable nature."

     "Out with it-- out with it."

     "It is this.  You recollect that, upon the marriage of Miss Flora
Bannerworth with your nephew, Mr. Charles Holland---"

     "The marriage feast, you mean, for, as far as the marriage was 
concerned,
they all got the better of the old man."

     "Yes; the marriage feast.  You recollect that, upon that occasion, you
gave me leave to invite a number of persons, all of whom were very grateful,
and thought very highly of you and the honour of coming into your company."

     "A devil of a sensible fellow this lawyer is," thought the admiral. 
"It's enough to make one take to lawyers, I'll be hanged if it ain't.  Go
on-- go on; what of all that?  I am sure I was as well pleased to see them 
all
as they were to see me."

     "Well, sir, it appears that some of these persons, and especially a
family of the name of Clark, have been exceedingly anxious to bestow some
civility upon you in return; and, as they have been invited to a wedding, 
they
wish to prevail upon you to go with them, as it will be a very stylish
affair."

     "Well, I don't mind," said the admiral.  "Where is it?"

     "It's as far as twenty miles off, at a place called Anderbury, and it 
is
wished that you should bring anybody you like with you, upon the occasion."

     "Well, it's civil, at all events, and I don't mind, if Henry and 
Charles
and Flora like it, going.  But, when you mention Anderbury, I'll be hanged 
if
I don't think it's the very place that Jack Pringle has gone to, to get a
sight of the salt water, for the benefit of his health."

     "Well, sir, it will have none the less recommendation to you, I dare 
say,
that it is close to the sea."

     "You are right there, and, I can tell you, I was thinking of going
myself, because you know, what suits Jack, in those respects, is pretty well
sure to suit me; and I thought, as that vagabound was enjoying himself down 
by
the sea coast, I might as well go and do so likewise."

     "Well, sir, then I may consider I have your full consent to the
arrangement, and I am sure it will be received by the parties with a great
deal of satisfaction, indeed."

     "Well, well, somehow or another, you talk me over to things, so I'll 
go,
without making any more fuss about it; and I will take Henry with me, and
Charles, and Flora, and I'd take old Varney, the Vampyre, too, if we had him
here.  It would be a good bit of fun to take such a fellow as that to a
wedding."

     "He would not be the most welcome guest in the world."

     "No; I should think not.  But who are our invitations to come from?"

     "They will come from the bride's mother, as the people I have told you
are so anxious to take you with them are friends of hers."

     "Very good-- very good; so, as it's all right, I will speak to Henry
about it, and Flora, and, I dare say, we shall all manage to get there
comfortably enough.  Let me see; it's just two stages for post-horses.  
Well,
well, lawyer, you may look upon it as decided; it is to be, and there is an
end of it."

     In due course, on the following day, there came a note to Admiral Bell,
enclosing a card, on which was said,

     "Mrs. Williams requests the honour of Admiral Bell's company, with his
party, to breakfast, on the 10th instant, at two o'clock, on the occasion of
the celebration of the nuptials of Miss Helen Fedora Williams with the Baron
Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh, ., ., at Anderbury-on-the-Mount."

     "The devil!" said the admiral.  "This is an odd affair-- something
slashing, and out of the way, I should say.  Breafast [sic] at two o'clock!
that's the d--dest piece of humbug in the whole affair.  Who the devil is to
wait for their breakfast till two o'clock?  I never heard anything better 
than
that; but I suppose there will be something to eat, so I shall take the
liberty of having my breakfast at seven in the morning, and calling that my
dinner, and my lunch I will manage to get at some inn on the road."

     With this card of invitation in his hand, the admiral went to Flora, 
and
laid it before her, saying, --

     "Here will be fine fun, Flora, for you.  This is the invitation I spoke
to you of, and they are going to have breakfast at two o'clock, lunch, I
suppose, at five, dinner at nine, a cup of coffee at about twelve, supper at
four o'clock in the morning, and I suppose they will get to bed at about
daybreak."

     Flora laughed as she perused the card, and then she said,--

     "It certainly promises to be quite a fine affair, uncle; and, at all
events, as we are only guests, we shall be able fully to enter into the
amusement of the affair, if there be any, and I am inclined to think there
will be, by the rather pompous reading of the card of invitation which has
been so civilly sent to us."

     "If they are ridiculous people," said the admiral, "we will laugh at
them, and they cannot expect but that we should; and if they should turn out
to be otherwise, they may become very pleasant acquaintances, you know."

     "Assuredly; and it will not do to judge of people always by such a
trivial piece of evidence as a card of invitation can afford to one; so I 
will
endeavour to go to the wedding with an impression that they are agreeable
people-- an impression which, considering the complimentary manner in which
they have invited us, we ought to cultivate."

     "Very good; and do you speak to Charles about it, for I have not had an
opportunity of so doing; and as the people have invited us handsomely, I 
think
we ought to go in a manner so as to do them as much credit as possible; and,
therefore, I should say that a coach and four, with postilions, will be the
plan, and look rather stylish."

     "Oh, uncle, you will be mistaken for the bridegroom."

     "Shall I?  Very well, I am quite willing that I should be, always
provided I may chance to admire the bride; but if I do not, you may be sure
that I shall take pretty good care to explain the error."

 Next Time: James Anderson Seeks and Obtains an Interview with Mrs. 
Williams.




                               CHAPTER CXIII.

JAMES ANDERSON SEEKS AND OBTAINS AN INTERVIEW WITH MRS. WILLIAMS.


     The report which, in accordance with what he had heard from Mrs.
Williams, Jack Pringle felt himself compelled to make to the young man whom 
he
had saved from the wreck, but too surely convinced him that all his hopes 
were
dashed to the ground, and that it was indeed but too true that Helen had
consented to become the wife of another.

     There could be no mistake in the affair, or the slightest loophole for
escaping an entire and complete conviction of the faithlessness of her in 
whom
he had so deeply confided for his future happiness.

     The blow appeared to fall upon him with a stunning effect, and for some
time he seemed to be quite incapable of thought or action.  But Jack Pringle
rallied him upon this state of things, and tried hard to induce him to view
the matter with the same kind of philosophy that he would have brought to 
bear
upon it.

     "Come, come," he said, "don't be downhearted about a woman.  Cheer up, 
my
lad; there's many a better fish in the sea than has ever yet been got out of
it, you may depend upon that."

     "I could have staked my life upon her good faith."

     "Likely enough, and so can we all upon the good faith of the woman we
happen to love and admire; but what is there in the whole world so common as
being jilted by a wench, and when it does happen, a man should whistle her
down the wind, and forget her all at once, and for ever."

     "I have no doubt," said James Anderson, "that such is good philosophy;
but it's a hard thing to tear away from the heart at once an image that has
lain enshrined in its inmost recesses for many a month."

     "Perhaps it is.  But the best remedy in all the world, is to look about
for another, I know that from experience in these matters.  You do so, and 
you
will soon be able to forget the girl who has jilted you."

     James Anderson shook his head, and smiled faintly, as he said, --

     "I fear I should never love another as I have loved her.  The heart, 
when
once it has loved as I have loved, can never know another feeling.  I cannot
with any hopes of success undertake such a mode of cure as that which you
point out to me."

     "Oh! you will think differently in a little while, I can tell you.  
Time
does wonders in these cases, and before you are a month older, you will be 
in
quite a different frame of mind to what you are now."

     "I must confess I should not like to be all my life the subject of
never-ending regret; but at the same time I do feel, that let what chances 
may
befall me, I shall never feel another disappointment so bitter as this."

     James Anderson, upon making these few remarks, shewed a disposition to
drop the subject, and as it was one which certainly concerned himself more
than any one else, Jack Pringle and the fisherman both agreed to say no more
about it, and it rested.

     But although he said nothing, the matter was far indeed from being 
absent
from the mind of James Anderson, for it occupied him wholly, and engaged his
attention to that extent, that all other thoughts were excluded therefrom 
most
entirely and completely.

     Those who had afforded him so kindly a shelter, were not unobservant
spectators of this state of his mind, and Jack Pringle strove to move him 
from
it, by calling his attention to his obligations and duties in other 
respects.

     "Come, messmate," he said, "ain't it time you should think of going to
London to make your report of how you lost the dispatches that your captain
committed to your care?"

     "It is so," said James Anderson, "and I shall start this evening."

     "That's right, and the best thing you can possibly do, I can tell you. 
You will get some new appointment, and in the bustle of life you will soon
forget all disappointments whatever.  If you go regularly into the service,
you are young enough yet to rise in it, and you may yet live to have a pair 
of
swabs upon your shoulders, I can tell you."

     "At all events," said Anderson, "I can have the comfort of knowing that 
I
have, by being wrecked here, made some acquaintance, which I hope I may 
always
have the pleasure to retain.  I feel myself now quite well enough to walk, 
and
I will go into the town and make some preparations for getting on to London,
which I am, by your liberality, Mr. Pringle, enabled to do."

     Jack made a wry face, as he said, --

     "Whatever you do, messmate, don't call me Mr. Pringle-- my name's Jack
Pringle.  It always has been Jack Pringle, and it always will be.  I begin 
to
think as something must be the matter when anybody calls me Mr. Pringle, and 
I
don't like it a bit."

     "I won't again then offend you by calling you Mr., but you shall be 
Jack
Pringle, if you like, to me; and I can only say that a more esteemed friend
than yourself, it is not likely I shall ever encounter in this world."

     Jack was always much more easy under censure, let it come from where it
might, than under praise, and consequently he fidgetted about in a most
alarming manner, while James Anderson was professing to him his grateful
feeling, and at length he said, --

     "Belay there, belay there, old fellow-- that will do.  I don't want any
more of that, I can tell you.  It's a d--d hard thing that a man cannot save 
a
fellow man's life, without it being at all sorts of odd times thrown in his
teeth in this way.  Don't say any more about it, I ain't used to being
_parsecuted_."

     This was no affectation in Jack Pringle.  On the contrary, it really 
was
to him a positive persecution to be praised; and, as James Anderson now felt
fully convinced that such was the case, he determined upon avoiding such for
the future.

     Towards the dusk of the evening, having attired himself as respectably 
as
the wardrobe of the old seaman and his son would permit him, for his own
clothing had been completely spoiled by the salt water, he proceeded to the
town of Anderbury.

     By so proceeding, Jack Pringle considered that his principal business
would be to get some means of quick conveyance to London; but James Anderson
had another motive in his walk to the town, which he communicated to no one.

     That motive was a strong desire to see Helen Williams, if he possibly
could, before he left, in order that he might hear from her own lips what it
was that prevented her continuing her plighted faith towards him; for he 
could
not, from all he knew of her character, bring himself to believe that it was
the wealth of her new suitor that had had any effect upon her.

     "No, no," he said; "I know her far better than for one half instant to 
do
her such an injustice; she must have been imposed upon with some account of 
my
death; or some artful and well-arranged tale of, perhaps, faithlessness upon
my part has hurried her into the acceptance of the first offer that has been
made to her.  If I could but obtain an interview with her for a few brief
moments, I should know all, and either be able to take her to my heart 
again,
or to find ample reason for forgetting her."

     He knew the way well to that house where he had frequently watched 
Helen
enter and emerge from; but how to send any message to her was a matter which
required great consideration.

     He had been absent long enough, no doubt, for some changes to have been
made in Mrs. Williams's household; so that, although there had been in old
times a servant who was favourable to him, and who would not only have taken
his message to Helen, but would have told him all the news of the family, 
she,
no doubt, had long since left.

     After thinking over the matter for some time, so as to come to a
conclusion that the difficulty about getting any message or note delivered 
to
Helen almost amounted to an impossibility, he saw a boy come out of the 
house,
apparently to go on some errand, and with a feeling more of desperation than
reflection, he spoke to him, saying, --

     "I think you came out of Mrs. Williams's house, my lad."

     "Yes, I did," said the boy; "what of that-- hit one of your own size; I
haven't done nothing to you."

     "You mistake altogether, my boy; I am not going to touch you, you may
depend; but, on the contrary, I will reward you if you will answer me what
questions I shall propose to you, and I assure you they are all such as you
may honestly answer."

     "Well, I don't know.  How much?"

     "One shilling for every question."

     "That's a rum way of doing business, but it ain't so bad either.  Ask
away, and you'll soon see how I'll earn the shillings."

     "Is Miss Helen going to be married?"

     "Yes-- a shilling."

     "Who to?"

     "To the Baron Stollandmare and a Salt Bug-- two shillings."

     "Will you take a note from me to her if I reward you extra for so 
doing."

     "Oh, I begin to smell a rat.  Yes, I will.  You is some other lover, 
you
is-- three shillings."

     "I am-- one shilling."

     "What do you mean?"

     "Why, my young friend, if I pay you a shilling a question, I don't see
why I should not charge you at the same rate; so don't ask me anything, and
then you will get all the shillings to yourself, you understand."

     "Oh, I doesn't see any joke in that; I don't want to ask any questions-
-
not I. -- What will you give me for taking the note?  I think I ought to 
have
half-a-crown, between you and me and the post; because, you see, if old 
Mother
Williams was to cotch [sic] me, she would serve me out pretty tidy."

     "You shall have your own price of half-a-crown, and here is the note,
which I charge you mind to deliver into no hands but those of Helen 
herself."

     "Oh, I'll do it; and what shall I get if I bring you an answer back?"

     "Another half-crown; so, you see, you will make a very good evening's
work of it, indeed, if you are clever and faithful."

     "Give me the note; I'll do it.  You may always trust me, when there's
anything to be got by it.  My father brought me up to get my living, and he
used to say to me, 'Caleb,' says he, 'always do your duty, Caleb, to those 
who
employ you when you go out to service in a family, unless somebody offers 
you
something more not to do it.'"

     "Quite a philosophical maxim," said James Anderson; "I suppose you are 
in
the service of Mrs. Williams?"

     "Yes, I am page of all work, I am; I do a little of everything, and 
make
myself generally useful.  Where will you wait for me?"

     "At this corner; and, with a due regard to performing your part well, 
be
as quick as you can on your mission, for I am rather impatient to see its
results."

     Caleb, the page of all work, duly promised to be quick, and after
completing an errand that he had been sent upon by Mrs. Williams, he 
returned
to that lady's house.

     We cannot help thinking that after the principles in which Caleb had
announced he had been brought up, it was rather an indiscreet thing of
Anderson to trust him with the note that he had already prepared for Helen, 
in
case an opportunity should present itself of getting it delivered to her; 
but
he was desperate, and, perhaps, did not so accurately weigh the pros and 
cons
of the affair, as he undoubtedly ought to have done.

     As it was, however, he had a faith in his messenger, which we are sorry
to say was most decidedly misplaced, for Caleb did shew that he had not
forgotten the lessons of his paternal relative, but that, on the contrary, 
he
was disposed to carry them out with great tack and perseverance.

     Whether or not he would, of his own accord, have set about scheming in
the matter we cannot say, but, at all events he was spared that trouble, for
Mrs. Williams had seen, from one of the windows of her own house, his
interview with one who was a stranger to her; for, although she had once,
before he went to sea, seen James Anderson, he was much altered, and she did
not recognize him; and when Caleb came in she called him into the parlour 
and
shut the door.

     "Caleb," she said, "I insist upon knowing immediately who you were
talking to just now in the street, and who gave you a note."

     Caleb was rather staggered at this home question, for he did not think
that Mrs. Williams had seen him, and, after a moment's pause, he said, --

     "What will you give, missus, to know?"

     "Give-- give!  How dare you ask me such a question?"

     "It's no use, missus, getting in a passion about it.  I've got an
opportunity of earning eight shillings snugly and comfortably.  If you will
give me sixteen shillings I will tell you all about it; and I don't mind
saying, beforehand, that I know, missus, as you won't think it dear at that
price; no, nor at three times as much, if you could only guess what it was."

     "Sixteen shillings!  It must be something wonderful, in the way of 
news,
that I would give you such a sum for."

     "That's just what it is, missus.  Come, now, is it a bargain? because 
I'm
in a hurry, and have got never such a load of things to do."

     "Well, well, Caleb; tell me what it is, and give me the note."

     "Not till I haves the money, missus.  Oh, no; I knows better than that. 
I've got a hold on the fellow as you saw me with, but I haven't on you.  Oh,
no; the deuce a bit.  I must have the cash first, and then you shall have 
the
information; and, I tell you again, that it ain't dear at the price, as you
will own yourself."

     The curiosity, as well as the suspicions, of Mrs. Williams were 
strongly
excited; for she began to suspect that something or another was going on in
which her interests were involved; inasmuch as, upon mature consideration, 
she
had come to a conclusion, that there was more in the visit of Admiral Green
than quite met the eye.

     "Well, well," she said, "I have only gold in my purse; but you shall 
have
the amount, you may depend, Caleb, if I promise you."

     "I haven't a doubt in the world," said Caleb; "but there is nothing 
like
ready money, missus; so just hand us a sovereign, and here is four shillings
change; which will be right, you know, all the world over."

     This was vexatious; but, as it was quite clear that Caleb had 
thoroughly
made up his mind not to part with his information without the cash, Mrs.
Williams was compelled to hand the amount to him, which she did not do with
the best grace in the world, and then she said, --

     "Now, I expect you to tell me all."

     "So I means, missus.  You don't suppose I'd take sixteen shillings of
you, and not tell you all as I have to tell you.  No, missus; I'd scorn the
action."

     "Well, well, don't keep me in suspense; but go on at once."

     "I will.  There's a chap at the corner of the street, as wants me to 
give
this here letter to Miss Helen, and bring him back an answer."

     "A letter to Helen!  This is news, indeed.  And who was he?"

     "That I don't know.  I was going to ask him, but, somehow or another, I
found out it was a great deal better left alone.  But I should not wonder,
missus, but you will find out who he his, if you read the note.  People, you
know, usually put their blessed names at the end of their letters, unless 
they
sends what is called a _synonymous_ one."

     This was a good suggestion of Caleb's, and Mrs. Williams, without the
smallest scruple as to the fact of opening a letter addressed to another
person, tore asunder the envelope that covered young Anderson's epistle, and
read as follows, in a sufficiently audible tone to enable Caleb to hear 
every
word of it; for, in her intense eagerness, she forgot the fact of his
presence: --

     "Dearest Helen, -- I can still address you as such, because I have not
yet heard from your own lips, although I have from the lips of others, that
you have forgotten me.  Can it be true, that you are about, in the face of
Heaven, to plight those vows to another which were to be mine, and mine 
only?

     "I ask of you but to meet me, and tell me yourself that such is the 
case,
and you will meet with neither persecutions or reproaches from me.  Tell me
that you are oppressed, and you know well that in me you have a defender. 
Name your own time and place of meeting me; and by the boy who will deliver
this to you, let me beg of you, by the memory of our old affection, to send 
me
an answer.

                              "Yours ever,

                                 "JAMES ANDERSON."

     "I say, missus, that's pitching it rather strong," said Caleb.

 Next Time: Mrs. Williams's Manoeuvre to Get Rid of Anderson.




                                CHAPTER CXIV.
                                
MRS. WILLIAMS'S MANOEUVRE TO GET RID OF ANDERSON.


     This exclamation from Caleb informed Mrs. Williams of the fact of his
presence; and duly indignant was she at that circumstance; for, in her 
anger,
she immediately rose to execute upon him some vengeance; and, had he not
adroitly eluded her, by leaving the room, there is no doubt she would have
well made him remember indulging in such a piece of impertinent curiosity.

     "That wretch," she exclaimed, "has overheard me; and who knows, now, 
that
he may actually go and tell the other.  If he would betray him, he would
betray me; and what redress should I get for such a circumstance?"

     This was a mental suggestion which made it necessary Mrs. Williams 
should
not only look over the fact of Caleb having stayed to listen to the letter,
but likewise see him, and hold out some other inducements to him to be
faithful to her, however he might chose to behave himself to other persons.

     "Caleb," she said, when she had summoned him again into her presence;
"Caleb, you may depend I will make it well worth your while to attend to me 
in
this affair, and to no one else.  I can, and will, pay you well; and, when 
the
baron marries Miss Helen, I dare say, if you would like it, I should be able
to get you some great place at Anderbury House."

     "Well, missus," said Caleb, "I looks upon myself as put up to auction,
and the highest bidder always has me.  I don't mean to say but what you have
done the right thing, as regards the sixteen shillings; so what would you 
like
me to do next, missus?"

     "I want you to take a note back, in answer to that which you have 
brought
me; but, of course, the young man who gave it must suppose that it came from
my daughter Helen."

     "How much?"

     "What do you mean by how much?"

     "How much am I to get, I mean."

     "Oh, I understand you.  How much do you expect for such a piece of
service?"

     "Something handsome, I should say.  What do you think of ten shillings
and sixpence, missus?"

     "I think it rather high, Caleb; but, nevertheless, I shall not stop at 
a
trifle in rewarding you, provided always I may depend upon you."

     "Money down," said Caleb; "you know, short reckonings make long 
friends,
missus; besides, it's always better not to let these things accumulate; for,
if we goes on doing business in this here sort of way, it would come to a 
good
bit in a short time, and then you would think it was too much, and wouldn't
like to pay it."

     With a bad grace -- for Mrs. Williams never liked parting with her 
money
-- she produced the sum which Caleb required for this new service, 
remarking,
as she did, --

     "Well, Caleb, you will soon grow rich, if you go on this way."

     "Likely enough, ma'am," said Caleb; "I likes to be paid, and I don't 
see
why I shouldn't."

     Mrs. Williams soon handed him the note, which merely contained the 
words,

     "Come at eight o'clock, and ring the door bell."

     These words she wrote as much as possible in her daughter Helen's hand,
and, having sealed up this extremely laconic epistle, she handed it to 
Caleb,
directing him to go at once and deliver it to the party who was expecting 
him,
and we must say, that this lad appeared to be one of the most thoroughly
selfish rascals the world had ever produced, for he was now quite willing 
for
money to betray Mrs. Williams to James Anderson, if there was any likelihood
of his accomplishing such a purpose with safety.

     But here some difficulties presented themselves, which Caleb's natural
acuteness enabled him very well to see.  In the first place, James Anderson,
he shrewdly suspected, was not the sort of individual to be trafficked with,
as Mrs. Williams was, and, considering that he had already committed an
immense breach of trust, in giving the letter to Mrs. Williams, instead of 
to
Helen, he thought, and, we are inclined to think, correctly enough, that it
would be rather a hazardous thing to say anything to him about it.

     "No, no," he said; "I'll just give him missus's letter, and then back 
out
of the whole affair, for I don't half begin to like it.  That young fellow
looks a chap that wouldn't mind wringing one's neck for one -- for half a 
pin;
so I'll just leave him alone, and say nothing more about it."

     James Anderson waited round the corner with considerable impatience, 
for,
in consequence of the proceedings that had taken place at Mrs. Williams's,
Caleb had been considerably delayed.

     When, however, he saw him coming, hope again sprung up in his bosom, 
and
he felt all the agitation of extreme pleasure, as he saw that Caleb had in 
his
hand what was undoubtedly a letter.

     When the boy reached him, he advanced to meet him, eagerly exclaiming, 
as
he did so, --

     "You have the letter-- you have seen her, and you have her answer?"

     Now, as Caleb had made up his mind to commit himself but as little as 
he
possibly could with the young stranger, he went upon the good old adage of 
the
least said being the soonest mended, and, accordingly, instead of making any
remark which might, at a future occasion, be thrown at his teeth, he 
satisfied
himself by placing his finger by the side of his nose and nodding his head
sagaciously.

     He then handed to James Anderson the letter, in the contents of which
that individual became too much absorbed, short as they were, to pay any
further attention to the messenger.

     Caleb thought this a good opportunity of being off at once, before any
troublesome questions should be asked him, so he made a retreat, with all 
the
expedition that was in his power.

     James Andeson, when he looked up from the perusal of the one sentence
which the letter contained, was astonished to find his messenger gone,
considering how very eager he had before been on the subject of the reward
which he was to get for that service.

     "What can have become of the boy?" he said; "I had a hundred questions 
to
ask him."

     So well had Mrs. Williams succeeded in imitating the handwriting of her
daughter Helen, that James Anderson was fully convinced the letter was 
written
by the chosen object of his heart.

     He certainly did think that it was cold and distant, and that there 
might
have been a word or two of affection, at all events, in it, especially
considering how long he had been absent, and with what an untiring affection
he had ever thought of her.

     "She might have told me that her heart was the same," he murmured to
himself, "or else she should have let me known at once that it was so 
altered
I should not know it for the same.  But still it is something to look 
forward
to an interview with her.  She may not have had the time to write more, or,
perhaps, she may have doubted the messenger, and thought it unsafe to utter
anything concerning her real feelings in this epistle."

     Thus hoping, and trying to persuade himself of the best, did James
Anderson anxiously expect the hour when, by the note that had been sent him,
he expected once again to look upon the face of her, the remembrance of whom
had cheered him in many a solitary hour, and enabled him to bear up against
evils and misfortunes which otherwise had been insurmountable.

     It wanted but a very short time to eight o'clock, and, at five minutes
before that hour, James Anderson walked, with trembling eagerness, up the
steps of Mrs. Williams's house door.  His hand shook, as he placed it upon 
the
bell-handle, and told himself that the time was come when all his doubts 
would
be resolved, and he should really know what he had to hope, or expect, or to
fear.

     There was certainly a something weighing heavily upon his heart, an
undefined dread that all was not well, and, during the interval between his
ringing and the opening of the door, he felt all that sickening sensation
which is ever the accompaniment of intense anxiety, and which renders it so
fearfully painful a feeling.

     The door was opened by a female servant, who had received her
instructions from Mrs. Williams, so that she knew exactly what to say, and,
without waiting for the visitor to announce himself, she said,

     "Are you Mr. Anderson, sir?"

     "Yes-- yes," he said.

     "Then I am ordered to ask you to step into the back parlour."

     "All is right," thought James Anderson; "she expects me, and has 
prepared
for my reception."

     He followed his guide implicitly, for he fully believed, as who would 
not,
under the circumstances, that she was in Helen's confidence, and so could be
safely trusted.

     She led him into the back parlour, where there was no one, and then she
said, --

     "If you will be seated for a few minutes, sir, my mistress will come to
you."

     "Her young mistress, she means," thought James; and he prepared himself
to wait, with what patience he could assume, and that, under the 
circumstances,
was by no means a large amount; for he had been kept in such a constant 
worry
by what had occurred, that suspense became one of the most agonizing 
feelings
that he could possibly endure, now that his fate was about so nearly to be
decided.

     It was no part of Mrs. Williams's plan to keep him waiting, for she
certainly had no fancy for retaining such a customer in the house as James
Anderson; for, playing the double part that she was, she knew not what 
sudden
accident might happen to derange her plans, and, probably, render them
completely abortive.

     For all she could tell, Helen herself might actually descend the 
stairs,
and enter that very room where she hoped a short conference would suffice to
get rid of the troublesome claims of James Anderson for ever.

     She was in the front parlour when he was shown into the back, for they
communicated by folding doors.  She had but to open these doors, and at once
show herself to the astonished Anderson, who little expected on that 
occasion
to behold the mother instead of the daughter.

     He gave a sudden and violent start of surprise; but, as Mrs. Williams 
had
determined to do the dignified, and to call herself quite an injured person,
she took no notice of the evident agitation of his manner, but said, with an
assurance that only she could have aspired to, --

     "May I ask, sir, under what pretence you write notes to my daughter, at
such a time as this? -- notes which appear to me to be highly calculated to 
do
her some serious injury, and, consequently, which I cannot but think are
intended for that precise purpose."

     "Mrs. Williams," said James Anderson, "since it appears that I have 
been
betrayed, and that the messenger I perhaps foolishly trusted, has delivered 
to
you, instead of your daughter, the note I addressed to her, I have only to 
say,
---"

     "I beg your pardon, sir," said Mrs. Williams, interrupting him; "but as
it was from my daughter I received your note, you may spare yourself the
trouble of blaming the lad whom you had to seduce from his duty by bribes 
and
corruption."

     "From your daughter?"
     
     "Yes, sir; from my daughter; and I flatter myself that there is too 
good
an understanding between my daughter and me, for her to keep as a secret 
such
a circumstance."

     This was a very unexpected blow to James Anderson -- a blow, indeed,
which he was totally unprepared for; and yet, although he doubted, he had no
means of disproving what Mrs. Williams chose to assert in the matter; and 
she
quickly saw the victory she had gained over him, and the difficulty in which
he found himself.

     "Sir, " she said, "if you have anything more to add to what you have
already said, my daughter desires that you should inform me of it, and if it
consists of such matter as she can properly take notice of, she will reply 
to
it by letter; but she most unhesitatingly declines an interview, which she
considers cannot be productive of anything but unpleasantness to all 
parties,
and most of all to her, considering her peculiar situation, and that she is
so soon about to alter her condition, and become the wife of the Baron
Stolmuyer, of Saltzburgh."

     "I'll not believe it," said James Anderson, "unless I hear it from her
own lips."

     "I suppose, sir, when you see it announced in the 'County Chronicle,' 
you
will believe it?"

     "That," said James Anderson, "it never will be; for I cannot, will not,
dare not think that one whom I have loved so well could be so false."

     "False, sir!  What do you mean by that?  I shall really have to speak 
to
the baron, if you use such expressions towards his intended wife."

     "I'll speak to the baron," said James, "and that in a language he shall
understand, too, if I come across him."

     "If you threaten, it will be my duty to inform the baron, so that he 
may
take such legal steps as he may be advised."

     "I repeat to you, Mrs. Williams, that I will not believe it; and since
you force me to such a declaration, I have no hesitation in saying that I
think you are quite capable of selling your daughter to the highest bidder,
and that the baron you mention probably occupies that unenviable position-- 
a
position which no gentleman would, for a moment, wish to occupy, and which 
he
perhaps is not fully aware of.  I will see him, and explain to him that 
there
are prior claims to the hand as well as to the affections of your daughter."

     This threat rather alarmed Mrs. Williams; for she thought it possible
that, if the baron really found there had been a former lover in the case,
probably much encouraged by the lady, he might think his chances of 
happiness
rather slender, and decline keeping the engagement which she considered was 
so
suspiciously commenced.

     This might or might not be the result; but at all events it was worth
consideration, and placed the matter in rather a serious light.

     Therefore was it, then, that Mrs. Williams determined to have recourse
to her last expedient, and that was the production of the written promise to
marry the baron, which it will be recollected, in the excitement and impulse
of the moment, she had succeeded in procuring from Helen.

     "Well, sir," she said, "since you will not be convinced by any ordinary
arguments, and since you doubt my word in this matter, I shall be under the
necessity of adopting some means of explaining to you the matter fully, and 
of
showing you that there is abundance of proof of what I have asserted."

     "Proof, madam!  Nothing but an assurance from Helen herself can come to
me in the character of proof in such an affair as this.  Let me see her; for
the mere fact that you sedulously keep her from me, involves the affair in a
general aspect of suspicion."

     "Read that, sir, and if you know anything of the handwriting of her 
whom
you affect so much to admire, it ought to resolve your doubts."

     James Anderson took the paper in his hand, and glanced upon it, and by
the sudden change that came across his countenance as he did so, Mrs. 
Williams
saw that it was having all its effect.

     He could not doubt it.  He knew that signature too well.  He had it to
some affectionate documents, which he felt would remain by him to the latest
day of his existence.

     It was indeed a horrible confirmation of all that had been told him --
such a confirmation as he had never expected to see, and which, at one blow,
dashed all doubt to the ground.

     "Now, sir," said Mrs. Williams, with a triumphant air, "I trust that 
you
are satisfied-- at all events, of one fact, and that is, that my daughter 
had
consented to become the Baroness Stolmuyer, of Saltzburgh; and without at 
all
entering into the question of anything which may have passed between you and
her upon other occasions, I think you ought, as a gentleman, to perceive 
that
the sooner you go away the better."

     "It is enough," said James Anderson.  "Falsehood, thy name is woman."

     "I really can't see, sir, what you have got to complain of, for people
have a right to alter their minds upon the little affairs of life, and I 
don't
see, then, wherefore they should not have a similar privilege as regards
things of more importance."

     "Enough, madam-- enough.  What steps I may hereafter take, upon a due
consideration of these affairs, I know not; but now I bid you farewell."

     Mrs. Williams was very glad to hear these words, or rather the last of
them, because she was in perpetual dread, during the whole of the interview,
that something would occur by which a meeting would take place between James
Anderson and Helen herself, at which some very disagreeable explanation 
might
take place.

     It was a wonderful relief to her when he had left the house, and she
heard the streetdoor close behind him, and she drew a long breath when such
was the case, as she said to herself, --

     "Well, thank the fates, that job is over, and a good thing it is.  
There
is no knowing what mischief might have been the end of it, if it hadn't been
stopped as it has.  He is not a bad-looking young man, and if he had had a 
few
thousands a year, I certainly should not have made any objections to his 
being
my son-in-law; but I possibly cannot, and will not, have poor people in the
family.  There is no end of trouble and bother with them; and instead of
getting your daughters off hand, it's just taking on hand, in addition, some
man for their amusement."

     James Anderson went sorrowfully enough back to the fisherman's cottage,
where he related to the sympathising old seaman what had occurred; for Jack
Pringle was not there, and if he had been, James Anderson knew very well he
would have got no sympathy from him on account of the circumstance; for the
frailties of the softer sex did not seem to have any material effect upon 
Jack
Pringle or his sympathies, since, by his own account, he had been jilted so
often, that he now thought nothing at all of it.

 Next Week: The Return of the Resuscitated Man, and the Robbery at Anderbury
 House.




                                CHAPTER CXV.

THE RETURN OF THE RESUSCITATED MAN, AND THE ROBBERY AT ANDERBURY HOUSE.


     The morning after the occurrences that took place in the bone-house of
Anderbury, broke dimly and obscurely over the ocean in the neighbourhood of
that town.  For leagues away, as far as the eye could reach, there was a
haziness in the atmosphere which the fresh wind that blew did not dissipate.

     There was a white light rising in the horizon, which did not cast the
warm glow over the bosom of the ocean as it sometimes does; it was dull, 
cold,
and cheerless; there was nothing that could be called beautiful.

     The waves dashed about, and came tumbling over each other, their crests
now and then covered with foam, which was swept off by the fresh breeze that
blew over the ocean.  It was just daylight.

     There was nought in the landscape save the water and the sky -- nothing
else to be seen for miles.  Yes, there was one object, and that was a boat
washed to and fro by the waves as it sat on the bosom of the sea, wafted
hither and thither, as the waves impelled the boat, which appeared to be 
empty,
for no oar was used, and no human form was visible.

     But that boat, so lonely, and left to its own guidance, or rather that 
of
the waves, contained a living being; it was he who had striven so hard to
escape from the baron on the preceding evening.

     He sat alone in the bottom of the boat; he was fatigued -- he was
shivering from the cold.  The great exertions he had undergone were followed
by a reaction; but he knew not where he was, or in which direction to pull, 
or
where the shore lay.

     How long he lay in this helpless condition it is not known; but he
occasionally lifted his eyes upwards and across the sea, to watch which way
the vessels sailed, and if any should come in sight.

     The scene was one of singular desolation and dreariness, in which 
nothing
could be seen that could cheer the eye or gladden the mind of man.  Now and
then, to be sure, a gleam of sunlight would cross the dreary water, but it
seemed to enliven only a small spot, and that but for a very short time, for
it soon again became obscure.

     There was the dreary ocean with its leaden-coloured sky, and then the
boat at the mercy and direction of the wind and waves, both of which seemed 
in
no placid humour, though not absolutely squally.

                *               *               *               *

     A vessel from Cherbourg, with brandies, for the port of London, was
sailing direct for the mouth of the Thames, making for the Foreland, where 
it
would have to round the point, and then enter the mouth of the river.

     There were three or four men and a couple of boys on board; when they
came near the boat, --

     "Boat, ahoy!" shouted the man on the look out; "boat ahoy!"

     No answer was returned to the shout, and the men on board shouted too,
and crowded to the side of the vessel to see what was going on, and who was 
in
the boat.  The captain came up; he had been in the cabin, but hearing the
shout, he came on deck to see what was the matter.

     "What is the matter?" inquired the captain, looking around.

     "Boat on the starboard," said one of the men; "nobody in it, I think; 
she
seems to be drifting."

     The captain looked at the boat for some minutes attentively, when one 
of
the men said, --

     "Perhaps some wreck, and the boat has been swept away by the waves, or
the crew hadn't time to get into her, or something of the sort."

     "No," said the captain, "she's not a ship's boat-- a shore boat, that's
what it is, lads.  She's got washed out, or somebody's drowned, upset, or
rolled out."

     "Something of the sort, I dare say, sir."

     "Well, we needn't heave to for her-- she's no service to us, and we 
can't
spare time."

     "I think there's some one in her."

     "But the boat's drifting," said the captain; "but she's coming this 
way,
and that will be the easiest way to ascertain the truth of our conjectures."

     They steered the vessel so as to meet the boat, which the sea was 
beating
towards them; and in about twenty minutes or half an hour, they came within 
a
couple of score yards of the boat, when they could plainly perceive that 
some
one was sitting in the bottom of the boat.

     "Hilloa!" shouted the captain; "boat ahoy! -- ahoy!"

     The man who was in the boat looked up, and seeing the vessel, he 
answered
the cheer.

     "Throw him a rope," said the captain to one of the men who were 
standing
by.

     A rope was made fast to the vessel, and then it was thrown by a strong
arm to the boat, and came right athwart it, and was immediately made fast by
the man who was in it.

     He then began immediately to haul up the rope, and so draw his boat up
alongside of the vessel, and then he came on deck.

     "How now, shipmate, what do you do out at sea in such a cockle-shell as
that?"

     "Nothing." replied the other.

     "Nothing!  Well, you have come a long way to do that.  What induced you
to come to sea, or were you driven out, or how was it you came here?"

     "I was driven out against my will," replied the man; "I was rowing 
about
shore, when I fell asleep, thinking myself safe, having secured the boat, as 
I
believed, safely enough."

     "Ay, ay," said the captain; "and so you found out, when you awoke, your
mistake?"

     "I did.  My moorings had broken away, which was only a boat-hook and a
rope; the tide coming up, lifted the boat hook out, and I have been out to 
sea
ever since, and don't know where I am."

     "Why that must have been last night," said the captain.

     "Last night it was," said the stranger.

     "You have been to sea all night then?" added the captain, taking a long
gaze at the stranger.

     "Indeed, I have, and I am quite cold and hungry.  I had nothing with 
me. 
I rowed some time in hopes of getting in shore again, but unfortunately 
didn't
succeed.  I suppose I got further out to sea, rather than nearer in shore."

     "Well, that is about the fact; you must be about fifteen miles out at
sea," said the captain; "you are a long pull away from shore, I can tell 
you,
and how you will get get [sic] back again, I don't know; but, at all events,
you are a very queer-looking fish, and I suppose your being out at sea all
night, and no stores, makes you look as you do; though, upon my soul, I 
don't
know what to make of you; but you mustn't starve.  Here, lad, bring up some
coffee and boiled pork.  Can you eat any?"

     "Thank you," said the unfortunate being, "I can.  I have been out for
many hours."

     "Well, sit down, or rather go below, and eat; when you have done, come 
up,
and we will tell you where the land lies, though I don't know how you will
keep it in sight for the life of me."

     The man then went below, where there was some coffee royal made for him
-- that is, coffee and brandy -- and some salt pork was given to him, of 
which
he partook most plentifully, apparently, while the captain muttered to
himself, --

     "Well, of all the odd-complexioned shore-going sharks as ever I saw, 
you
are the oddest!  D--d if I should think he was wholesome-- there's a great
deal of the churchyard about him."

     "There isn't a very agreeable look about him," said one of the men; 
"but
I suppose he has been so much frightened, that he looks more like a vampyre
than anything else."

     "Aye; or a revivified corpse."

     "Yes, sir."

     "But that arises from his being so terrified and starved, as well as
fatigued; exposure all night, all added together, has almost changed the
current of his blood."

     The man came up now, having had sufficient provisions below, and had
expressed himself much gratified with the coffee-royal to the cook, who, in
his own mind, thereupon declared that he must be a Christian after all, 
though
he had obtained by some means the complexion of a white negro.

     "And now," said the captain, "if you like to go with us to London, you
shall go with us, for, as I said before, we cannot run into any port before
we get there, for the wind is favourable and strong."

     "I would sooner get back by means of my boat," replied the man, "if I
were sure of making land."

     "You might, if you could keep in a straight course, but there is the
difficulty; you cannot do so very well without a compass, and that you have
not got."

     "No, indeed, I have not-- though with it I have no doubt of being able 
to
reach the land."

     "I have," said the captain, "a small one below, a pocket compass; you
shall have that, and see what can be done; and if you get ashore, it will 
have
done some service at all events."

     "I shall be greatly obliged to you for your kindness," said the 
stranger; 
"but I am wholly at a loss to know how I shall ever be able to repay your 
kindness."

     "Say nothing about that; we who get our bread upon the sea, know well 
the
risks we all run, and therefore do not mind lending a hand to each other 
when
in distress and trouble."

     "I will endeavour to save some one else in your line of life, if I 
cannot
you," replied the stranger, "and so, if it be possible, make some return."

     "Aye, that will do mate; do a Christian's charity to any one whom you 
may
cross, and I shall be well paid for my trouble."

     The boat was now brought up alongside the vessel, and, before the
stranger embarked, the captain said to him, as he held the compass in his
hand, --

     "You must place this compass on one of the thwarts of your boat, 
shipmate."

     "I will."

     "A precious vessel she is, for a voyage out of sight of land; but, 
never
mind, you are safe enough, unless a sea was to come and roll over you-- but
that's neither here nor there.  Mind you keep your boat's head to the
north-west, and, by so doing, you'll make land at the nearest point from 
where
we are now."

     "Thank you," said the man.

     "Moreover, you must pull so as to keep her head in the direction I tell
you.  It will be too long a pull for you to get there by rowing-- you would
get too tired to keep your seat, and you are unused to it, too,"

     "I am obliged to you," said the man; "if I get to shore safe, I shall 
be
under great obligations to you.  You will have saved my life."

     "I have ordered enough biscuit, and grog, and cold beef, to last you 
till
night-- you will get to shore before that time, I have every reason to 
believe. 
In five or six hours you ought to get there; but, in case of accidents, 
there
is enough to last till night."

     "You have loaded me with obligations."

     "Say no more; be off with you and pull away from the vessel as quickly 
as
you can; for we have slackened our speed for you."

     "Farewell; a pleasant voyage to you," said the man.

     "Good bye, and good luck go with you," replied the captain.  "Keep to 
the
northwest, and all will be well; push off, and keep your eye on the 
compass."

     The man did as he was desired; laid the compass on one of the thwarts;
took the oars in his hands, and began to row away with good will.

     The crew of the vessel crowded to the side and witnessed the departure 
of
the boat, and when she was a few hundred yards off, the sails were spread, 
and
the vessel ploughed through the waves, leaving the boat behind, a mere speck
on the sea, diminishing each moment.

     But yet while the boat was within hailing distance, the captain said to
the crew, --

     "Give him a cheer-- he may meet with a score of accidents before he
reaches shore, any one of which will be sufficient to destroy him."

     The crew obeyed, and gave a loud shout to the boat, and the captain 
added
his own voice; the cheering huzza reached the boat, for the occupant 
elevated
his oar, and returned it.  The solitary cheer was borne to the vessel 
faintly
but distinctly; however, they gave him one cheer more, and then pursued 
their
way over the trackless waters.

                *          *          *          *          *

     The boat pursued its course for some distance, until it was too far 
from
the vessel to be seen, and then, slackening his pace, he contented himself
with merely keeping the boat's head in the direction which he had been told,
and in which he knew the land lay.

     There was no hurry and desire to reach the land, but merely to keep 
where
he was; and when any vessel hove in sight, he pulled so as to keep clear of
her and out of hail; and there were a great many who passed near him, and
would have aided him had he required any; but that did not seem to be his
object.

     Midday was passed, and the sun began to decline towards the west, when
the boat was gradually brought nearer and nearer in shore.

     Not only was the shore visible, but the very houses might be counted, 
and
yet he would not come ashore, but appeared to be awaiting the sinking of the
sun before the boat chose to seek the protection of the land.

     It was about sun-set that the provisions, which were given by the
captain of the vessel, were now consumed, and that while they were being 
eaten,
the occupant of the boat sat still with his eyes fixed upon the town, which
was every moment becoming hidden in the approaching denseness of the night;
and, at length, could not be distinguished, save by the existence of 
numerous
lights, that shewed the precise position in which it lay.

     Darkness now came on, and nothing was to be seen on the ocean whatever,
and he remained yet longer at sea; but at length there was no danger of 
being
noticed; he gradually rowed his boat in shore and secured it.

     Then jumping ashore, he wandered about the town from one place to 
another,
and, finally, he determined to make his way to Anderbury House.

     "There is, at least, plenty of everything there," he muttered; "and,
though there are plenty of servants, yet, in so large a place, there is 
ample
room to secret oneself, and plenty to be had for the trouble of taking it."

     He came to a small public-house, which he entered, with the view of
resting a short time, and of ascertaining what was going on in the town.

     There were several people seated in the public-room, and he now seated
himself up in one corner of the room, unobserved by anybody.

     "Well, well," said one; "there is more than one strange thing of late
that has happened.  The baron has given some very handsome entertainments."

     "Aye, so he has," said one.

     "And more than that, they say he's going to keep 'em up till he gets a
wife; though I cannot tell why he should leave them off then, because women
like that sort of thing too well to make any objection to its being carried 
on
after marriage."

     "The baron is very right; if he carried it on then, he would be watched
by his wife, who would take good care to rate him for any attention he might
pay to any of the ladies; and, therefore, it would only be keeping up the
means for being scolded to keep up the balls."

     "Ay, it would only be getting into hot water, and keeping the kettle
boiling on purpose."

     "He would," said another man, "merely be keeping the entertainments on
for the purpose of showing off his wife and her self-will, as well as her
power over him, and showing them all how she could rule a man-- a very
favourite pastime with married women, who, when they have a partner who 
don't
like fighting and quarrelling, and who does love peace and quietness, know 
how
to give it him."

     "I think better of the baron, who, I think, is a man who wouldn't stand
much of that."

     "Ah, you don't know what an upas-tree a woman can become, when she
pleases."

     "Well," said another, "the strangest thing that I know of is the loss 
of
Bill Wright's boat."

     "Oh! what was that?  I have heard something about it, though I can't 
say
I have heard the rights of it yet.  What was it all about, eh?"

     "Why, he says, when he went to bed, he left his boat safe enough moored
to other boats and afloat.  Bill says he'll swear she couldn't get clear
without help; but she did get clear, and there is nothing to be seen of it 
now,
at all events, and poor Bill is in a devil of a way about it, too, I can 
tell
you, and good reason enough."

     "Yes.  Bill will scarce be able to get another boat, unless some good
friend should give him one, and that is scarce likely, I think as times go."

     "There's no ball at Anderbury House, to-night, I believe," said one of
the visitors.

     "None, that I know of."

     "No, there is none," said another, "because I know of several who have
got leave of absence; so they are short-handed there, and they would not be
so if they had anything particular going on, for the baron does the thing
handsomely."

     "So he does."

     The stranger listened to all this conversation very quietly, for some
time, muttering to himself, --

     "That is well.  It will suit my purpose very well.  I will go and see 
how
the land lies in that quarter.  I have objects in view, and some of the
valuables to be found there, at all events, will aid my projects, and assist
in my comfort, and I may as well have them from there as anywhere else;
besides, I know more of that place.  It suits my taste to do so, and will be
somewhat in the shape of revenge."

                *          *          *          *          *

     Calling for his reckoning, which he paid, he left the house, and
proceeded towards Anderbury House.

     It was now nine o'clock or a little later.  No one was about, or 
scarcely
any, and those few the moving figure endeavoured to avoid.  He turned out of
the usual paths, and walked over the fields and unfrequented ways, keeping
near the hedgerows, until he came to the bounds of the grounds of Anderbury
House.

     Here he paused, and bethought himself of the best means of entering the
house unseen and unsuspected by any one, else his object would be defeated.

     However, after a few moments' thought, he determined to proceed, and, 
for
that purpose, he made for a spot where the fence was low, and ran by some
trees that had been cut down and grew bushy.

     Having reached there, he, by aid of the branches, contrived to get over
into the grounds, and then made his way swiftly towards a plantation that 
ran
up close to the house, and by means of which he hoped to reach the house, 
and
perhaps to enter it.

     Silently he made his way into the plantation, and just as he reached 
it,
he saw the moon rise in the east; it was just rising above the horizon.

     "Thanks," he muttered, looking towards the luminary, "thanks you did 
not
appear before; but now you are welcome, for I can keep under cover of the
trees, and the deeper the shadow, the safer I am from observation."

     This was right enough.

     The moon rose full, but not bright, for some clouds seemed to 
intervene,
or rather some thin vapours, which gave her a strange colour, and, at the 
same
time, increased her apparent size; but she rose rapidly, and as she rose 
that
would wear off, and she would resume her silvery appearance and usual
diameter.

     He was now safe in the plantation, but, at the same time, it would
require some caution not to be discovered, for, at times, even the 
plantations
formed beautiful evening walks, in which many of the inhabitants of 
Anderbury
House had indulged at various times, and especially when there was what was
termed a family party.

     On a moonlight night, when there were several members of the family who
knew the grounds well, then they would find ample amusement in wandering
about.

     However, there was no such parties on this evening, and as it followed, 
he
ran no danger.  Lightly, therefore, he crept forward, making no sounds save
such as it was impossible to avoid.

     The foot-fall upon dried leaves -- the cracking of sticks, and the
rustling of the smaller under-growth, when he came in contact with it.

     "How I shall be able to pass the open spaces, I know not," he muttered;
"but I have passed worse spots than this, and I may be pretty confident I
shall succeed in escaping detection on this occasion; however, it shall be
tried.  There are few who are about-- all is quiet and still-- the very 
watch
dogs are quiet and asleep."

     He crept onward now until he came within some hundred and fifty yards 
of
the house itself, when he paused and listened, but hearing nothing, he again
came forward and approached to within a few score yards of the house, when 
he
was suddenly arrested by the sound of voices.

     He paused and listened; it was a female voice spoke near; she was
evidently speaking to a man.

     "Now, William," she said, "do you really believe you can get in without
making any noise?"

     "I am sure of it, providing you leave the window open, and the rope
there."

     "Yes, yes, I will.  Well, that room is empty; pull off your shoes, and
creep out of the door; don't let it bang together, or it may alarm some 
one."

     "Yes, yes; I'll take care."

     "Well, then, remain in the passage or room until I come to you; but
should you be disturbed, you can hide yourself in any of the closets, or go 
up
stairs, which will bring you to the floor on which is my room."

     "I'll take care; but don't forget the rope, and to leave the window 
open."

     "I'll not forget.  I'll throw the rope on one side, so as to hang among
the vine leaves, so that it will not be detected by any one accidentally
coming this way, though that is very unlike, indeed."

     "I understand; for the matter of that, I think the vine is strong 
enough
to bear me without the rope."

     "I would not have you make the attempt lest you fall, and are killed,
William; be sure you do not make the trial; what a thing it would be if you
were discovered, and all were to come out-- I should be ruined."

     "Never fear that; I will take care, both for your sake as well as my 
own."

     "Then good bye."

     Some words were then uttered in a whisper, the import of which he did 
not
hear, but it continued for a minute or two, and then the female said, --

     "Wait here a few minutes, and you will see me come to yon window, and 
let
down the rope; and then begone as quickly as you can."

     "Never fear for me; I will wait here until I see you at the window, and
then I will leave."

     The female figure he saw glide quickly away, and he watched it until 
she
was out of sight, and then he watched for the signal also.  He could see the
form of the male figure, who stood within about three or four yards from the
spot where he was concealed.

     Then, after a time, he saw the female figure come to the window 
indicated
by her, and then throw the rope out of it, and cause it to hang down by the
side, or among the leaves of the vine, so that it could not be seen, except 
it
were looked for.

     When this was done, and the figure saw the female had withdrawn, he
turned from the spot, and walked hastily away further in the plantation, and
when he was quite out of hearing, and the stranger could no longer hear his
footsteps among the dried rubbish in the wood, he walked cautiously forward 
to
the edge of the grounds, and then gazed up at the house, and listened
carefully to ascertain if there was any sound at all indicative of the
vicinity of any human being.

     Hearing none, he assumed another attitude, and prepared to make a dart
forward to the window, as he muttered, --

     "The coast is clear, and it will be hard, indeed, if I do not now 
succeed. 
Once in the house, I will soon secure myself, and the contents of some of 
the
baron's drawers-- some of his gold will be mine."

     Again taking a cautious survey, and, being perfectly satisfied that he
was unobserved, he dashed across towards the root of the vine, and, in a
moment more, he had seized the end of the rope; but he heard the sound of
footsteps.  What to do he could not tell, but sprang up a few feet, and 
buried
himself among the leaves of the vine, which were very luxuriant.

     The footsteps were heard closer and closer, until he could perceive the
very female who had thrown the rope out of the window stop within a few 
inches
of him, and then seize hold of the very rope he had been about to seize.

     Her object was to ascertain if the rope was low enough to be reached; 
and,
when she had adjusted it to her mind, she exclaimed, in a low voice, to
herself, --

     "Ah! that will do; he will easily find it, I dare say; and it will be 
all
right.  Nobody will see it."

     Having satisfied herself of that, she left the spot, and returned the
same way she came.  It was an awkward situation as anyone could well indulge
in without discovery.

     "It was a very narrow escape," he muttered.  "I had no idea of her 
coming
back in that way; I never dreamed of such a thing. But no matter; I believe 
I
am quite safe now; if not, I shall have some other escape.  She must have 
been
next to blind not to see me."

     However, he got down, and then pulled down the rope straight; and, by 
the
help of that and the vine, he then pulled himself up to the window, into 
which
he speedily got, and found himself in an empty room.

     Here he paused, to ascertain if he could hear any one moving about; but
he heard nothing, and at once proceeded to feel his way, cautiously, along 
to
the door, which he approached with a cat-like step.

     Opening the door, he paused to listen, before he ventured into the
landing to which it opened; but, finding the coast clear, he went through 
that,
and then into the next room, which was apparently a store room, being filled
with a variety of things of a miscellaneous character, and which were only 
of
occasional use in the house.

     This he closed, and went up stairs, where he came to a suite of 
servants'
bed-rooms, and thence he walked about from room to room, until he came to a
portion of the house he recognised, and then he made direct for the baron's
own room.

     "There," he muttered, "I am likely to meet with what I want; and the
carpets are soft, and give no noise.  I can sleep for a short time, if I 
will."

     He made at once for the baron's sleeping room, which he opened and
entered.  It was empty, and he at once closed the door; then he made an
instant search about for a place of concealment; and, having found one, he
began to make a search for some other matters, that were not of the same, 
but
a more valuable character in the market.

     However, he found out the drawers and depositories; but he was unable 
to
open them, because they were locked; and he must wait until the baron had 
gone
to sleep, and then, taking his keys, he would be able to help himself, 
without
any difficulty, to what he most desired.

     He had scarcely made this determination, before he was alarmed by the
footsteps of the baron, as he ascended the stairs.  This produced a 
necessity
for instant concealment; and he immediately flew to the spot which he had
chosen; and, scarcely had he done so, before the room-door was opened, and 
in
walked the baron himself, who brought in a light with him.

     He remained walking about some time, examining a variety of matters, 
but
appeared as though he never intended to go to sleep.  There was every
probability of his discovering the place of concealment; which was easily 
done,
had he but turned his head, or moved his hand, under certain circumstances;
but, as fortune willed it, the baron did not.

     It was near an hour before the baron sought the repose he might have
taken, but for the dominion of the spirit of restlessness; and it was even
then some time before he fell into a sound slumber, apparently being engaged
in deep thought.

     However, he did fall asleep, and the tongue of Morpheus spoke loudly --
like some human beings, through the nose; and then it was the hero of
Anderbury church-yard stole from his concealment, and began to examine the
chamber.

     "Where are his keys, I wonder?" he thought.  "He must carry them about
him; but he must have left them somewhere in his clothes; and if I can 
obtain,
and use them, without making any noise, it will be fortunate."

     He found the keys, though not without making a slight jingle with them,
but that caused no motion on the part of the baron, who lay snoring in his 
bed.

     He stole to the drawers, and the key fitted; he quietly unlocked it and
drew it open.

     "Fortune befriends me," he muttered.

     At that moment the baron turned in his bed and heaved a deep sigh, and
appeared for a minute or two restless, and as if on the point of waking up.

     The intruder, however, stopped short in his depredations, and paused, 
and
then crouched down, lest the sleeper might open his eyes, and, by a 
momentary
glance, detect him.

     Suddenly he spoke, but indistinctly -- very indistinctly, and yet 
loudly
enough.  The stranger started -- he thought himself detected; but he found
that the baron was only dreaming.  He drew nearer to him, and listened to 
what
he said.

     "Ha!" sighed the baron; "she is very beautiful-- very beautiful.  Ha! 
her
form and face are perfection!"

     He paused, and again went on, but too indistinctly.  A word or two was
heard plain enough now and then, but it was impossible to form any sense of
them -- they had no connection with one another.

     "She is a very beautiful," again muttered the baron in his sleep.  "She
is lovely-- amiable-- what a wife!"

     Then he again fell into a train of half-mumblings, from which nothing
could be gathered.

     "Heavens, what a prize!" exclaimed the baron, and again he relapsed, 
but
appeared more composed and quiet.

     "I would he were nine fathoms deep below the level of the sea," 
muttered
the robber; "and then I should not be bothered by him.  Sleep, or let it
alone," he exclaimed, between his teeth.  "It would almost be safest to 
kill---
and yet, one cry might bring the whole household upon me."

     Turning to the door, he ascertained that it was locked.  He turned the
key, and, in doing so, made a noise with the lock which had the effect of
causing the baron to start in his sleep.

     "What was that?" he muttered, in sleepy accents.  "I thought I heard 
the
door go; but it can't.  I locked it-- I remember very well I locked it."

     After this speech he fell fast asleep.

     "Another escape," muttered the intruder, who rose from his crouching
posture, and setting the door open, so that he could, in case of an 
accident,
make his escape from the room.

     Then he again turned towards the drawers, and began to help himself to
the contents, when he accidentally struck the keys, which fell with a clash 
to
the floor.  In an instant the baron started up on his elbow, and pulled 
aside
the curtain, to see what was the cause of the disturbance.

     In a moment the light was put out, and the intruder had assumed a
motionless posture; but it was too late to escape the quick eye of the 
baron,
who instantly jumped up, exclaiming, as he laid his hand upon a pistol, 
which
he had under his pillow, and cocked it, --

     "Ah! robber-- assassin!  Stand, or I fire!"

     The sound of the cocking of the pistol was quite enough.  It came
distinctly to the ear, and suggested the idea of more than ordinary danger
with it; and he dashed past, heedless of the command of the baron, who 
called
upon him to stand.

     The baron fired, and in an instant the house was filled with a stunning
report, which echoed and re-echoed from room to room, filling the inmates 
with
wonder and alarm.

     The sensation produced by the sound was of that description that can
hardly be described.  To be awaked from a sound sleep by such a dreadful,
stunning report, which carried such a sense of danger with it, that they
remained in an alarming stupor for nearly the space of a minute, until, 
indeed,
they were aroused by the shouts of the baron, was rather terrifying.

     Hardly had the stunning and deafening report died away, when the baron
leaped from his bed to ascertain if his shot had taken effect.

     The intruder heeded not the commands or the shot of the baron, for he
dashed out of the room at his utmost speed, making his way towards the lower
portion of the house, that offering greater facilities for escape.

     The baron, as soon as he had recovered from his first surprise, jumped
out, and seizing a heavy cane that was lying across one of the chairs, he
rushed after the flying figure, shouting and calling to his people to get 
up.

     "Robbers! thieves!" he shouted.  "Here, help-- help to secure the 
robbers
who are in the house."

     The intruder made for the lower stairs, but was closely followed by the
baron, who could just see the dusky form of the object of his pursuit before
him; but now, in the lower rooms, where there was no light at all, the
shutters being up, he missed him.

     The robber had taken advantage of the darkness, and doubled upon his
pursuer, and hastened up stairs with the view of reaching the place where he
entered.

     In doing this, however, he was met by one of the men who was coming 
down. 
There was no time for deliberation, and he dashed up, regardless of the blow
the man aimed at him, who said, --

     "Here you are.  Here goes for one on 'em."

     As, however, the battle is said not always to be with the strong, so in
this instance he was unable to accomplish his object, for the blow, by the
agility of the robber, was evaded, and the result was, that the serving man
was suddenly whirled down the stairs, and being once on the descent, he did
not stop until he got to the bottom.

     "Murder! murder!" shouted the unhappy individual, as he rolled down 
stair
after stair, until his cries were stilled by a violent concussion of the 
head.

     In the meantime the stranger rushed up stairs at a headlong speed, 
until
he attained the landing which led to the room at the window of which he
entered.  Securing the door behind him, and then getting out of the window,
and seizing the rope, he began to descend very rapidly, fearing he would be
intercepted by those below.

     He slipped down the rope rather than let himself down, and before he 
had
got half way down, he met with an impediment, which, however, quickly gave 
way,
and they both came down plump to the earth together.

     "My God! my God!" exclaimed a man's voice, in great terror and
tribulation.  "What's that?  what's that?  Mercy-- mercy!  I didn't mean to 
do
any wrong."

     The stranger heeded not the words of the terrified swain, who, it would
appear, had begun to ascend to reach the dormitory of his fair but frail 
one,
when his flame was so unceremoniously quenched in the way we have related, 
but
dashed away from the spot, and was speedily lost in the plantation, whither
the unfortunate individual when he had sufficiently recovered his senses, 
and
released his head from the inprisonment of his hat, soon after betook 
himself,
thankful the affair was no worse.

 Next Week: Jack Pringle Falls in Love, and Has Rather an Unhappy Adventure
 with a Bold Dragoon.




                                CHAPTER CXVI.

JACK PRINGLE FALLS IN LOVE, AND HAS RATHER AN UNHAPPY ADVENTURE WITH A BOLD
DRAGOON.


     Jack Pringle, like other men, was subject to the vicissitudes of the
passions, which placed him under a certain string of circumstances that
produce results quite at variance with those which are usually anticipated
when an individual enters upon the pursuits of the tender passion.

     Indeed, Jack could see nothing at all unhappy, or in the least degree
unfortunate, in the black eyes and rosy lips of Susan, who was most 
certainly
the "maid of the inn," though not in precisely the same rank as the one
alluded to by the song.

     He had taken up his residence at the inn, had Jack.  Indeed, he was
partial to inns in general -- there was usually a greater latitude permitted
there than elsewhere; not only each one being allowed to accomodate himself 
as
he pleased, but he could have what 'baccy and grog he chose to order, as 
long
as there was a shot in the locker.

     This being the state of affairs, Jack found another inducement to stay
where he was, and that was the existence of the before-mentioned Susan, who
appeared to be as kind as she was good-natured.

     She never refused to answer Jack's call; and when she came, she always
said, --

     "What did you please to want, Mr. Pringle?"

     "Mr. Pringle," thought Jack.  "Well, that sounds pretty from such a 
pair
of lips."

     Jack scratched his head, and turning his quid in his mouth, was often
lost in admiration, and forgot all his wants at that moment, and it was not
until the question was more than once repeated, that Jack was aware that he
really did not want anything, especially as his grog was not all gone.

     "Well," exclaimed Jack, looking at the glass, "I forgot; but never 
mind,
Susan, I'll have another can while this is going-- so I sha'nt hurry you.  I
woundn't hurry you, Susan-- no, that I wouldn't."

     The course of true love never did run smooth -- that is, we know, a 
rule
that is as old as the hills -- but then it is of constant recurrence, and 
one
that it may fairly be presumed always will, to the end of the world, and
possibly after.

     However that may be, Jack was not without a rival, and one of a very
formidable character; not that Jack valued him a piece of rotten yarn.  No; 
he
never did think anything of a landsman, especially a soldier, for it was to
that class this rival belonged.

     "Susan," said Jack, as he sat in the kitchen, watching the various
evolutions to which the hands of Susan were applied, in the performance of 
her
multitudinous duties.

     "Well, Mr. Pringle," said Susan.

     "Ah!" said Jack; and then there was a pause, during which Jack forgot
even to chaw his quid, and was quite abstracted in manner and thought.  He 
had
intended to say something, but it had quite escaped him; and it was 
difficult
for Jack to hold his thoughts, as it is for countrymen to hold a pig by the
tail when this latter member was well greased, and when it was of that
description usually denominated a "bob-tail," a common occurrence.

     "What did you say, Mr. Pringle?" said Susan, bustling about.  "I am 
sure
you were about to say something."

     "Well, I suppose I was," said Jack; "but I don't know what it was now;
but perhaps you do."

     "How should I know?  I can't tell what you are thinking about.  What 
made
you think that?"

     "Because your black eyes seems to go through me, Susan, like a forty-
two
pounder.  I tell you what, you ought to know what I want to say, because I'm
always thinking of you."

     "Are you, though?"

     "Yes, I am," said Jack; "you're a light craft-- a rare pretty figure-
head
you'd make."

     "Lor!  Mr. Pringle," said Susan.

     "Well, you would, though; and I'll take three dozen and never wink, if
there's one to be found half as handsome in the whole British navy, or in 
any
other."

     "To think," said Susan, "that I should be called a figure-head!  Well, 
I
declare, I never heard the like.  Why, what will you not say next?  I never
thought that of you."

     "Why," said Jack, who was very much bewildered, and didn't know 
precisely
what to say -- the turn the compliment had taken was one he couldn't
understand -- "why, you see, Susan, the figure-head is the beautifulest part
of the ship, except may be her rigging, her port-holes, her sides, and her
trim; but then, you see, them things ain't no manner of likeness to anything
human, especially you, Susan."

     "Ain't they, Mr. Pringle?  Well, you know best; but I dare say it's all
right, for you must know best.  But my cousin says I am more like the Venus
day Meditchy, than anything else."

     Jack stared.

     "Who?" he inquired, with his eyes opening very wide.

     "The Venus day Meditchy," said Susan, speaking in a very slow, emphatic
manner, for Jack's behoof.

     "Don't know her," said Jack.  "I'll go bail there ain't such a ship in
the navy.  There never was such a thing heard of, unless some of them d--d
French craft; but your cousin ought to be well cobbed for saying you were 
like
anything French.  Why, you are true blue, and no French about you-- is 
there,
Susan?"

     "I don't know; but I never heard there was, and I don't know if there 
is;
but that's what he said, and he's been a long way."

     "Who is _he?_" said Jack, laying emphasis upon the last word, to 
indicate
that the sound was displeasing.

     "Oh! my cousin."

     "Well, but who is your cousin?" inquired Jack.  "Have you see him very
lately?"

     "Yes, I saw him this morning; his regiment is quartered only a few 
miles
from this place."

     "Oh!" said Jack, "he's a soldier, then?"

     "Yes, he is-- a horse-soldier," added Susan.

     "A horse-marine.  Ah!  I know 'em afore to-day; they are a rare lot to
lie and gallop away.  But lord bless you, they never lay alongside an enemy
till you've beaten him.  No-- no-- they can't do that."

     "He'll be here to-night," said Susan.  "You shall see him, Mr. Pringle;
he's coming all this way to see me."

     "To see you!" said Jack Pringle, who was much displeased with this 
piece
of particular attention in the cousin, and he could not help saying so.

     "But he is my cousin," said Susan; "and you know one cannot refuse to 
see
one's friends and relations; besides, he has been at all times very kind and
good-natured to me, so that I cannot do otherwise than receive him kindly."

     "Oh, to be sure," said Jack; "by all manner of means; only we must
understand each other, Susan; there can't be more than one captain aboard at 
a
time."

     "How very odd you do talk, Mr. Pringle.  My cousin will ask you what 
you
mean."

     "Will he now?" said Jack.  "Well, he may do so, if he like; but my 
lingo
will be as good as his, I am sure; but we shall see him, however; but, 
Susan,
you don't care anything about him, you know."

     "Not a bit, Mr. Pringle; only as a cousin, you know."

     "Oh! very well," said Jack; "I don't care about that a bit; but if so 
be
you're going to carry on any games, you know, why, I won't stand it."

     "Oh, honour," said Susan, looking tenderly at Jack; "honour, you know. 
Do you think I could be capable of doing so?   No, I never do anything
unbeknown to a person.  No, I say, let all be fair and no preference."

     "Well," said Jack, "but I want all fair, but I should have no objection
to a little preference, too.  Don't you give no preference to me over a
soldier, Susan?"

     "Don't know," said Susan; but she gave a look towards Jack that made 
him
suspend the libation he was about to pour down his throat.

     "Oh!  I see how it is with you, Susy," said Jack, becoming more 
familiar
and pleased, for Susan's black eye had a magical effect upon Jack, and he 
felt
as if Susan must love him as much as he loved Susan; her eyes told him more
than her tongue; Jack was quite sure of that.

     "When is he coming?" said Jack.

     "To-night," said Susan; "and you must promise me you will be very quiet
and civil, and then you shall see him; only you won't take any notice of 
what
he says or does."

     "No, no," said Jack; "it's all right; I understand.  I won't quarrel 
with
him; no, not even if he were to-- but splinter my mainmast, if I could stand
that!"

     "Stand what?" inquired Susan, demurely.

     "Kissing of you," said Jack, striking the table with his fist, so as to
make the glasses that happened to be there tremble; "I couldn't; I could 
stand
the cat first."

     "Lor, Mr. Pringle! who asked you to do so?  I am sure, I would not do
such a thing."

     "What?" said Jack.

     "Why to let him kiss me, to be sure."

     Jack looked, perhaps felt, electrified, and, after a moment's pause, 
took
his quid out of his mouth, hitched up his trowsers, and then seized Susan by
the waist, and gave her a kiss. It was a kiss; such a one only as a
man-of-war's man could give; it went off like the report of a pistol.

     "Lor, Mr. Pringle!" said Susan, "I thought you were quite another sort 
of
a man.  What would my cousin, the dragoon, have said, if he had seen you? 
Dear me! you must have alarmed the whole house; I didn't think you were 
going
to make so much noise, though."

     A footstep approached, and the landlady thrust her head in; but Susan 
was
busy, and Jack was chewing his quid as grand as an admiral.

     "Susan."

     "Yes, ma'am," replied Susan.

     "What's the matter?"

     "Don't know, ma'am.  Didn't know there was anything wrong at all, 
ma'am."

     "I thought I heard a plate smash just now.  Are you sure you haven't
broken anything."

     "Yes; quite, ma'am."

     "Oh!" said the landlady.  "I certainly thought I heard a smash; but, I
suppose, it was a mistake altogether,  However I am glad of it."

     "There!" said Susan, when she had gone; "I told you how you had alarmed
the place."

     "Well," said Jack, who felt much abashed at what had happened, "I 
didn't
make so much noise, either.  But never mind; I'll take more care another 
time."

               *          *          *          *          *

     The evening came round, and with it came the dragoon, as fine a 
specimen
of military dress, discipline, and riotism as can well be let loose upon a
decent community, and Susan met him in the passage.

     "Ah! my pretty Susan," said the son of Mars, "the star of my destiny, 
and
the hope of my heart.  While I wear spurs, I will love you, ever dearest."

     "Oh! come, none of that nonsense, you know, Robert; it won't do; you 
say
too many fine things, you know."

     "Of course I do; but can I say them without occasion.  No; as well 
might
you want day without daylight-- the moon without moonlight.  You inspire me,
you see, and without you I couldn't say anything."

     "I dare say not," replied Susan; "you are such a man, that you make one
believe what you say."

     "You ought, since I speak the truth, and nothing else; but, come, come,
we'll go in.  I want to talk to you, Susan; I came on purpose to see you. 
There's the barmaid at the Plough and Gooseberry-bush, quite sulky because I
didn't stop there; but I know I promised you I would come, and so I would be
as good as my word."

     "Are you sure she was sulky?"

     "Certain, because she did would not say good bye."

     "Well, but now I want to speak to you about something I want to 
explain."

     "Explain, my dear.  I'll explain anything that can be explained-- I 
don't
mind what it is.  You'll never find me backward in coming forward with any
amount of explanation that you can by any possibility require."

     "That is not what I want.  I have a cousin here."

     "Aye; I'm not particular. I will pay her every kind of attention.  I am
sure you will acknowledge I am not wanting in any attentions to you."

     "Oh! dear, no; but it is not a female cousin that I want to speak to 
you
about."

     "Indeed!  I can't tolerate another."

     "Yes, but you must.  He's just come from sea, and is a very odd man, 
but
an uncommonly good-hearted man, so don't take any particular notice of what 
he
says or does."

     "I don't mind him a bit-- not the value of a pinch of snuff."

     "Yes, but you must do that, only don't do anything to vex him.  You can
be pleasant company when you please, I know."

     "And so I will."

     "To please me you will; for though I don't care anything for him more
than if he were my brother, yet he's very fond of me."

     "That's no recommendation to me," said the dragoon; "a spoony anchor
buttons, I suppose."

     "You must be civil to him, or I will never see you any more."

     "Well, then, my charmer, I will say anything you like to this salt-
water
fish of yours; but he mustn't lay hands upon you; if he should do so, why, I
should be obliged to chastise him."

     "But he's a man-of-war's man."

     "And I am a man of war myself, my dear."

     "Lor!" said Susan.

     Upon which she turned her eyes and face towards the dragoon, who could
not let such an opportunity slip, and he immediately saluted her in true
military style, but he did not commit the same offence that Jack Pringle 
did,
for the former told no tale by the report -- it was all quiet; and he 
followed
Susan until they came to the room in which Jack was sitting.

     "This is Mr. John Pringle," she said.

     "Aye, aye," said Jack; "here am I-- Jack Pringle-- afloat or on shore,
all the same."

     "And this," continued Susan, "is Mr. Robert Swabbem."

     "How d'ye do," said Jack, "Mr. Swabbem?  I dare say it is so; but since
we are to be shipmates, we may as well be friends-- how d'ye do?"

     "Pretty well, I thank you, Mr. Pringle-- very well, indeed.  Hope I see
you quite well, and at home?"

     "Yes, quite so-- both ways; well, and at home."

     "The devil!"

     "Yes, we call him Davy Jones; but, then, I suppose, you have one on
purpose, in your line?"

     "Why, there's a little of the devil in us-- that is pretty well 
admitted
on all hands; and that's as much as we have any wish to have in the way of
connection with the gentleman whom you name."

     "Aye, aye; maybe you'll know more on him afore you are done; but no
matter-- sit down, messmate, we can discuss a can of grog, I reckon."

     "Yes, easily.  I can do my duty in any point, friend, you may best
please.  Facing an enemy, drinking a can, or kissing a lass.  What more can
you say?"

     "I can do the same myself as some I know can testify, if they chose to
speak," said Jack, who gave a sly look at Susan; but at the same time she
nearly fell a laughing, when reminded of Jack's tremendous smack, which the
landlady mistook for a smashing of crockery; "but, howsomever," cried Jack,
who had relapsed into a grim smile, "we'll have a can together."

     "Very well; Susan, will you do what is needful for us?  If the landlady
would allow me, I'd wait upon you and do all your work."

     "And a pretty bobbery," said Susan, "she would make of it; you would 
soon
get discharged for tasting the grog on its way from the bar to the parlour."

     "Ah! well, I might get into trouble if I did that.  What do you say,
friend Jingle?"

     "Pringle," said Jack.

     "Oh, ah! Ringle.  I have it now distinctly."

     "Why, you swab," said Jack in a rage, "I ain't got no such kickshaw 
names
as them-- mine's quite different altogether, so say what you like."

     "My name," said the soldier, "ain't Swab-- but Swabbem, at your 
service."

     "Ah," said Jack, "whether Swab or Swabbem, it don't much matter-- we 
all
must fill our place-- some are luckier than other's, though they might be
cousins."

     "Cousins! curse cousins, say I."

     "Same here," said Jack; and then they both stared at each other,
believing each other cousins to Susan, though not to each other.

     "I am glad you are here," said Susan; "I have the grog for you; it is
extra strong.  I know, because I put some more into it; I turned the tap on
into each, and she didn't see me do it."

     "Ah, Susan, I see you have a great regard for me; but it is not more 
than
you ought, when you come to consider how I respect you," said the soldier.

     "The same here," said Jack, who thought this pretty good for a cousin; 
"I
admire Susan-- she's got such eyes, and such cheeks---"

     "So she has-- they are like diamonds set in roses; that they are."

     "Yes," said Jack, "and as soft as velvet."

     "Damme," said the soldier, "you beat me hollow.  I say, messmate, where
did you learn to fire your great guns off in that manner, eh?"

     "Where!" said Jack, putting the can down; "why, where there were men to
fire into us again.  I'll warrant you it was none of your field days, where
people are tearing their hearts out to look fine-- no, no; the lee scuppers
ran with blood, and every heart was a true British sailor's"

     "Well, that was good; but when I served on foreign service, there was 
no
getting out of the way of danger, behind a wall, stone, brick, or wooden."

     "No, nor even laying on the ground-- we had not even that; for as we
fought, we destroyed the very building which supported us, and we had the
spirits of the sea to contend against, as well as the dangers of the fight."

     "Oh, it's all very well," said the soldier, "but danger's danger, and
there's an end of the matter; only I wish there was no such thing as bad 
grog."

     "That's a great evil.  Why, what d'ye think we did at Portsmouth the 
day
after we landed?  The landlord gave us bad grog, and how do you think we
served him?  Why, we made him drink till he was so drunk he couldn't lay 
down
without being afraid of falling, and then we cut his hair all off."

     "Well, I recollect a place in Portugal where they brought us some wine
which we couldn't drink.  It was horribly thin and sour.  We had in vain 
asked
for better, but none was to be had at our bidding; indeed, we felt sure 
there
was better, and we determined to have it.

     "We called our landlord and told him we were resolved to ruin him if he
didn't bring it up-- we would have better wine; but he protested he had not
got any.

     "Now, we were resolved to search, and accordingly we did search until 
we
came upon some beautiful wine-- some of the best port ever I tasted, and we
made free with it.  At all events, we drank as much as we could drink, and
then fell fast asleep, and forgot to punish our landlord for the rascality;
but I suppose he was well aware of what he deserved, for he endeavoured to
excite some of the peasantry about to murder us while we slept, and when we
awoke, we found ourselves surrounded by a dozen men.

     "There was but three of us, but we were armed, and the peasants had
nothing but a miscellaneous description of weapons-- old guns, swords, and
clubs; but they were not the men we were.

     "Well, it came to a hard fight; more blows were struck, however, than 
did
any mischief, because we could make use of our tools, and fought so hard, 
that
they were glad to leave us victors."

     "Lor!" said Susan; "you don't mean that-- do you?"

     "I do, indeed; but that was nothing.  I frightened a whole regiment of
the enemy."

     "Eh?" said Jack; "what, a whole ship's compliment, eh?  Well, that will
do; go a-head; you beat all the cousins as ever I heard of, if you don't 
never
mind me, that is all about it; a good yarn, well spun, is worth a glass of
grog at any time."

     "Well, I'll tell you all about it; it's sooner told than done, I can 
tell
you; but never mind, Susan, don't be frightened; it's all past now, though 
it
was true; but the best things must have an end some time or other, and this
had one too.

     "I was serving in Spain.  I fought against the French then; and though 
I
say so, you may depend upon it I took my chance as well as another man. 
However, I had many inclinations to go a step or two beyond my strict duty,
and do more than I was obliged; but what of it?  If you succeed, you are 
sure
to be rewarded; and I wanted, if I could, to capture a pair of colours, 
which
would give me a step in my regiment.

     "'Charge, my brave boys!' shouted the colonel, as the enemy appeared
coming down upon us.

     "They were three or four to one, besides a reserve at a short distance. 
But we thought nothing of that; we had every reason to believe we were
outnumbered; but that was all; and we drove hard at them.

     "It was a glorious sight to see us full tear at the heavy-armed 
cavalry,
in squadrons; but they had the advantage of weight and number of men; yet 
our
shock was so great, that many of the enemy were thrown out of their saddles,
and many more were killed; we hewed and hacked at each other for some time,
until, in fact, the enemy began to give way.

     "As soon as we began to find out that, we urged our horses on, and
ourselves to strain our utmost, and we forced them back, and they began to
turn about in right earnest, and show us their heels.

     "Unfortunately for us there were no other troops at hand to support us. 
I say unfortunately, for while we were engaged in beating a larger force 
than
our own, and which even then outnumbered us, we were taken in the rear by 
the
reserve, and many men were cut down before our men could be called off.

     "Among those who were taken prisoners was myself.  I had received one 
or
two severe wounds, which were, indeed, considered mortal; but which were not
so dangerous as they were believed.

     "However, as I kept my saddle, I was taken prisoner; indeed, I was 
unable
to offer any resistance; my eyes were filled with blood ---"

     "Lor! how dreadful," said Susan.

     "It was dreadful to think of it, then; but I did not; I was too much
occupied with my desire to do my duty, so heated and excited, to think
anything about it.  I was dragged away.

     "Then what became of me, I don't know; but I have some recollection of
having a cloak thrown over me; and I rode away in company with them.  I know
we went away very fast, for they dreaded another charge of our men; and they
had succeeded in escaping and reforming, and they were hovering, reinforced,
upon our march.

     "Well, that night, as I was deemed too badly wounded to give them any
trouble, or attempting to make an escape, they let me lie in a stable.

     "I fainted away; and, after several attempts to restore me, they left 
me
as a hopeless case; but it was no matter to them, they didn't grieve.  I
wondered in my own mind, as to the reason of their doing so much; but I
suppose it was that prisoners were at a premium with them at that time; and
they were anxious to return as large a number of prisoners as possible; and,
upon the principle which induced the elderly dame to attempt emptying the 
sea
with a tea-spoon, that every little was a help, they thought that if I lived 
I
should be one more, and where the numbers were small, one was of importance.

     "They gave me up as a bad job altogether, and after they had racked up
their horses, they sat down for the evening to their meat and their wine. 
They had been all conversing together, but they were about to lie down and
have some sleep, when suddenly I awoke from my trance, and walked out 
without
at all knowing what I did.

     "The men stared at me, and shook like so many aspens, but did not stir,
till one of them said, --

     "'A ghost-- a ghost!"

     "This had the effect of clearing the place, for they all jumped up and
ran away from the spot, leaving me master of the place; and judging that I 
was
alone, I very soon made my way back to the quarters of the English, and got 
to
the quarters of my old regiment, where I was kindly received, my comrades
having given me up as lost."

     "Well," said Jack Pringle, "you were very nearly gone certainly, though
you warn't quite a ghost; but that ain't half so bad as a fire-ship--
especially in towing a fire-ship among the enemy.  I was once on an 
expedition
of that sort when I was in the Mediterranean."

     "Lor, a fire-ship!  What's that?" inquired Susan.

     "A ship-load of fire, with lots of combustibles," said Jack.  "It's a
thing that won't do for a plaything.

     "Well, the enemy had several, and, as we came up to them, we found they
had the wind in their favour, and the first thing they did was to put out
several of these fire-ships.  But the wind was not direct for them, it was
shifting.  Well, we were ordered to man the boats, and tow the fire-ships 
back
again amongst the enemy.

     "Well, you may be sure they didn't like that, especially when the
fire-ships blew up.  They did so with a dreadful explosion, setting fire to
friend and enemy, and blowing them out of the water.

     "This we did, and, as we towed the vessels along, we were fired at at a
pretty smart rate, I can tell you; why, the very sea seemed to boil around 
us."

     "Lor!" said Susan, "how dreadful!  Why it's horrible here when the pot
boils, and Heaven knows what it must have been there.  Why, I am sure, I
wonder how you escaped being scalded to death."

     "Why, some on 'em did get killed," said Jack.  "My starboard man was 
shot
through the head, and one or two more went on an errand to Davy Jones."

     "It was lucky for them," said Susan, "that they were sent out of the 
way
when there was so much danger going on around you.  I am sure I should have
been glad."

     "May be so," said Jack, turning his quid; "but I know this, them as was
sent upon that errand never came back any more; they stayed away altogether;
many of them becoming food for the sharks.  However, we towed awayed, and, 
the
breeze shifting, we got pretty well among them, and then we left the
fire-ships where they ought to be, among the enemy.

     "Well, we had a hard pull to get back, there being five or six ships
firing broadside after broadside at us; but they never hit the boat.  The
other boat they did hit, and a shot went clean through her, and she went 
down
in deep water."

     "And what became of the poor men that were in it?" inquired Susan,
horrified at the detail.

     "Some on 'em were drowned, and some we saved," said Jack; "but we had
scarcely reached our own vessel, when the fire-ships blew up, setting fire 
to
and damaging several of the enemy, who were near at hand, and covering the 
sea
with bits of burning timber, and many fell into the ships, setting fire to
their rigging, and knocking men on the head, and doing a world of mischief
besides."

     "Goodness me!" said Susan, "what a dreadful thing, to be sure.  I 
should
not like to be near a fire-ship.  At all events, missus is quite a fire-ship
here."

     There were but few observations to make.  Jack thought he had quieted 
the
dragoon, and had given him a dose of salt water; and, moreover, Jack ogled 
the
"maid of the inn" in such a way that speedily brought the military hero to a
sense of his danger, so, curling his moustache with his finger, he said, --

     "Well, it's all very well talking of the dangers of the sea, but it's
nothing to a storming party."

     "A storming party! what's that?" inquired Susan.

     "Why, I'll tell you, my dear, and then you'll know all about it.  You
see, we were at the siege of Bangpowder."

     "Never heard of such a place," interposed Jack; "what's the bearing of
that outlandish place?"

     "Oh, never there, eh?" said the dragoon, contemptuously; "then you 
don't
know it.  Talk of danger, you should have been there, and you would have 
known
what danger was.  However, I'll enlighten your ignorance.

     "You must see, Susan, my dear, that at Bangpowder we were very little 
use
in the way of assisting the siege, except that we acted as outposts-- 
foraging
parties-- and kept off the light troops of the enemy when they shewed
themselves, while the infantry set to work in the trenches to work the guns.

     "They did work them above a bit, too.  For weeks together there was
firing day and night, on our side and on theirs, so the air was never 
without
a strong smell of gunpowder, which you might smell for twelve leagues quite
strong."

     "Lor!" said Susan.

     "Smash my timbers," said Jack Pringle, "if you ain't a coming it strong
this time."

     "Well," continued the dragoon, taking no notice of what was said; 
"well,
that was nothing-- that was a mere trifle.  After some weeks' firing, we 
made a
hole in the wall, which increased day after day until big enough for a man 
to
enter.

     "After that, a storming party was ordered; but, after more than one
attempt, our men gave it up as a bad job.  Our captain, being a dare-devil
sort of fellow, and not liking to see men beaten back, said the breach was
practicable, and could be entered.

     "This was denied by the officers and men who had been defeated, and he
said if his own troop would volunteer, he would undertake to enter the 
place.

     "This was told us, and we all at once volunteered to follow him to the
devil, if he chose to go.

     "He at once informed the commander-in-chief, and we were ordered to
mount the breech.  To do this we of course dismounted, and went on foot.

     "There was some little excitement upon this matter, but we were cheered
as we passed, and when we arrived within a few yards of the walls, we were 
met
by a tremendous fire of all arms.

     "This, however, did not daunt us, though it thinned our ranks, and we
were less in number; but up the breech we went, one man at a time.  Six of
them, one after another, were knocked over dead as herrings.  Well, the men
began to look blue over this; they wouldn't have minded rushing on in a 
body,
and giving and taking till they all died; but to get on the top of a brick
wall, one at a time, to be shot at, why it was more than they liked,
especially as they had not struck one blow, or fired a single shot in 
return.

     "'Hurrah, lads!' said I; 'I'll have a shy, now; come on, and follow me
quick.

     "I jumped up and cleared the wall, though a thousand bullets were 
fired,
and got over clear without a shot, save one, that shaved some of my whisker
off.

     "We all got over, and soon after we were followed by some of the other
regiments, and the place was our own; but we were nearly stripped naked."

     "Oh, lor! how was that?" inquired Susan, interested.

     "Why, we had so many narrow escapes, that our clothes were all shot to
shreds."

     "Goodness!"

     "Oh, but it is true," said the dragoon rising, and going out of the
kitchen.

     In a few moments afterwards Susan left it also, and Jack, after turning
his quid, and squirting the tobacco juice on the floor, rose and hitching up
his trowsers with a preliminary "damme!" left the kitchen also; but he 
hadn't
got far, when, oh, horror! he perceived Susan in the arms of the dragoon,
whose moustachoed lips more than once met hers.

     "Sink the ship," muttered Jack, "here's a pretty go-- the black-looking
piratical thief."

     But Jack's peace was soon held, and he listened to an assignation which
Jack was determined he would keep himself, to the discomfiture of the 
dragoon.

     Having made up his mind upon this point, he returned to the kitchen, 
and
Susan also in a very few moments; but Jack pretended to be asleep, and
wouldn't speak to her, because he thought she hadn't behaved well in this
affair of the dragoon; he was resolved, however, in substituting himself for
the soldier, or, at all events, of making a row.

     The time came and Jack stationed himself upon a position where he could
with ease lift the dragoon into the water-butt below, in case he offered any
opposition to the substitution before named.

     The moment came round, and the dragoon was seen slowly and cautiously
mounting the way to the window of Susan.  It was a kind of leads just above
the water-butt, accessible by means of some wooden steps.

     "Avast, there," said Jack, when he got up to the level with the top. 
"What do you do there?"

     "What is that to you?" inquired the dragoon.

     "A great deal," replied Jack; "but you don't come here-- I heard all
about it; but I tell you what, you ain't a coming here, at all events."

     "But I am."

     "Don't attempt, or I'll sink you.  I will, by all that's good-- so keep
back, and go away."

     "I'll see you d--d first," said the dragoon.  "I have mounted a worse
breach than this before to-day; but I suspect there isn't much danger here."

     He ran up, and soon faced Jack, who seized him round the waist, would
have lifted him up in his arms, and could have thrown him into the water-
butt,
only Jack's foot suddenly slipped, and he fell down, the soldier upon him,
who in an instant regained his feet, and rolled Jack over and over, until he
came to the water-butt.

     Into this Jack went, head first, and kicked and floundered about; and 
if
the water-butt had not been very rotten, and gave way, letting all the water
escape, it is very doubtful if Jack would not have found a watery grave in 
the
confined space of a water-butt.

     As it was, he was more than blind and breathless, and sat down in the
midst of the water on the stones, to recover himself from the immersion he 
had
undergone.

 Next Week: The Proposal of Jack Pringle to Take Anderson to the Wedding.




                               CHAPTER CXVII.

THE PROPOSAL OF JACK PRINGLE TO TAKE ANDERSON TO THE WEDDING.


     A circumstance now occurred which soon enabled Jack Pringle to console
himself for the misadventure he had had, which he was delighted to think was
not known to any of those persons with whom he came ordinarily into contact.

     The pleasant circumstance to which we allude, was the reception of a
letter from the admiral, and by the mere fact of his writing such an epistle
to Jack, it would seem to be perfectly true that he really felt unhappy
without the companionship of that worthy.

     The letter was to the following effect: --

     "Jack, you mutinous rascal, your leave of absence has expired, and you
know you ought to have a round dozen when you come back to your ship; but as
it turns out you may stay where you are, for a reason that I am going to 
tell
you.

     "There is to be a wedding at the very place where you are staying,
between some odd fish, a Baron Something, I don't know who; but as we have
been all invited, we are coming down the whole lot of us, and shall arrive
on Thursday, so that you may look out from the mast-head as soon as you 
like,
and you will see us coming with all sails set.

     "No more at present from, you vagabond, you know who."

     "What an affectionate letter," said Jack; "I know the old fellow 
couldn't
do without me long-- he is quite an old baby, that's what he is; and if I
wasn't to take a little notice of him, he would be as miserable as possible. 
Hilloa!  What cheer? have you come back?"

     These last words were addressed to James Anderson, who at that moment
made his appearance in the cottage of the old seaman, he having just left 
the
house of the Williamses, after the painful interview which we have recorded
took place between him and Mrs. Williams, during which she had succeeded in
convincing him that all his hopes, as regarded Helen, were crushed 
completely.

     The appearance of deep dejection that was upon his countenance was 
such,
as to convince Jack Pringle the nature of the business he had been upon, and
he cried, --

     "Come, come-- cheer up, man.  I guess, now, you have been looking after
that sweetheart of yours, who is no better than she should be."

     "I have, indeed," said James Anderson, "been to extinguish all hope--
nothing now lives in my breast but despair.  I shall proceed to London at 
once,
to make my report to the Admiralty, as it is my duty to do so; and, after 
that,
I care not what becomes of me."

     "Stuff, stuff," said Jack; "I have got some news for you.  My old 
admiral,
that I take care of, has had an invitation to the very wedding, as I take it
to be, of your old sweetheart."

     "What! is it possible-- do you mean an invitation to Helen Williams's
wedding with the Baron Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh?"

     "Yes, I do; that's just what I do mean, and no mistake.  Here is his
letter which he has written to me to go, and I think I shall let the old
fellow, for it will amuse him.  Just read that."

     Jack handed the admiral's letter to James Anderson, which he read with 
a
great deal of interest, and when he had concluded, he said, --

     "Mr. Pringle, a sudden thought strikes me, ---"

     "About ship," said Jack, "and begin again.  I told you before not to 
call
me Mr. Pringle-- I cannot stand it.  Call me Jack, and then go on telling me
what your sudden thought is."

     "Well, then, Jack, my sudden thought is this, that your friend the
admiral might be induced, upon your representation, to let me join his 
party,
and I would take care to conceal my features and general appearance so that 
I
should not be known, while I had the mournful satisfaction of taking a last
look upon that occasion of her who I have loved, before she becomes
irrecoverably the wife of another."

     "If you wish it," said Jack, "it shall be done.  I'll undertake there
shall be no objection on the part of the admrial; and as for the 
Bannerworths,
they are good sort of people, and would do all they can for anybody, I am
sure."

     "I should take it as a peculiar favour; for although I feel now that my
hopes are blasted, and I can have no possible expectation of beholding her
with eyes of pleasure, I still wish to look upon her, that I may see if
anything of regret is upon her countenance, of if she has quite forgotten 
the
past."

     "Say no more," said Jack, "but consider it as done.  I'd take care 
though,
if I were you, that she did not find me out; for I wouldn't let the finest
woman that ever breathed-- no, not if she was seven feet high, and as big as 
a
hogshead-- fancy that I cared so much for her as to go to her wedding after
she had jilted me."

     "She shall not see me," said James Anderson; "she shall not see me, you
may depend; for, without doubt, the guests will be very numerous, so that I
can easily keep myself in the back-ground, and look upon her face without 
her
being at all aware of the presence of such a person at the ceremony."

     "Yes, you can manage that; and, if I were you, just as I was going 
away,
I'd give the baron a jolly good kick, and tell him you wished him joy of his
bargain.  I wouldn't do anything violent, you know, but a little quiet thing
like that would just show them all what you thought of the business."

     "A sense of my wrongs," said James Anderson, "should not extinguish a
sense of justice; and I have no means of knowing that the baron is at all in
fault in this matter."

     "Oh, you are too nice by one half.  If a fellow takes away my 
sweetheart,
hang me if [I] care who is at fault."

     "Oh, but it is necessary that we should be just at all events; but 
still,
Jack, accept my sincerest thanks for placing me in the way of looking upon
Helen.  I'd rather see that she was happy and contented with her lot, than I
would observe evidences upon her face of any passionate regret.  The former
would reconcile me, by making me think I had made a great mistake in the
object of my attachment; while the latter would leave in my heart a never
ceasing pain."

     "Gammon," said Jack.

     "I fear I tax your patience, Jack Pringle, when I talk in such a strain
as this."

     "I'll be hanged if you don't.  What do you mean by it?  There is lots 
of
women in the world.  I have no patience with a fellow that, because one girl
uses him ill, goes snivelling and crying about his feelings, and his agony,
and his chest, and all that sort of thing.  I should recommend a bottle of
rum."

     "Well, well, Jack, it may happen some day with even you, and then you 
may
feel some of the mental agony of knowing that another has possessed himself 
of
her whom you thought all your own."

     This was hitting Jack rather hard, although James Anderson did not know
it; so he said, --

     "Ah, well, to be sure, there is something in that, after all, and I 
don't
mean to say there ain't; but, however, keep up your heart, my boy, and there
is no saying what may happen yet."

     "Alas! there can nothing happen that can give me pleasure; all is lost
now, and the only hope I can have, is to forget."

     Jack would have written a letter back to the admiral in reply to the 
one
which he had received, only that somehow or other he was not a first-rate
penman; and as he said it was such a bother to know where to begin, and when
you did begin, it was such a bother to know where to leave off, that, taking
all things into consideration, he rather on the whole declined writing at 
all;
and, as the appointed day was near at hand, on which the wedding was to take
place, he thought it would do quite as well if he kept the look out which 
the
admiral had suggested for the arrival of the Bannerworths.

     As for the scheme of James Anderson to be present at the wedding, the
more Jack thought of it, the more he liked it, because he considered that it
afforded a chance, at all events, if not a good prospect, of as general a
disturbance as any that had ever existed.

     "Lor! what fun," he said, "if he would but kick the baron, and then if
the baron would but fall foul of him, and the girl scream, and old mother
Williams go into hysterics.  That would be a lark, and no doubt about it;
shouldn't I enjoy it above a bit.  I'd give them a helping hand somehow or
another; and then, who knows but the girl may have been regularly badgered 
by
the old cat of a mother into the match, and may wish for all the world to 
get
out of it."

     There can be no doubt but that if Helen Williams, even at that last
moment, chose to make any appeal, it would not be made in vain to Jack 
Pringle,
who, with all his faults, and they were numerous enough, had in his heart a
chivalrous love of right, and a hatred of anything in the shape of 
oppression,
which nothing could subdue; and such qualities as these surely are amply
sufficient to atone for a multitude of minor errors, which were more those 
of
habit and defective education, than anything else.

     It very much delighted him to think that the admiral and the 
Bannerworths
were coming down to Anderbury, because such a fact not only prolonged his 
stay
there, which he was pleased it should do, because he was really very much
delighted with the place, but it at the same time threw him again into the
company he so much liked; and his attachment to the Bannerworth family had
really become quite a strong feeling.

     He waited quite with impatience until the Thursday came on which the
admiral had announced his arrival; and instead of being in the town, or on 
the
outskirts, to watch for him, which would have been but a tiresome operation,
Jack walked boldly on to meet them by the high road, which he knew they must
traverse.

     After he had gone about four miles, he had the satisfaction of seeing, 
in
the distance, a travelling-carriage, manned, as he called it, with four 
horses,
rapidly approaching, and Jack immediately produced a large silk handkerchief
that he had purchased, which was a representation of the national flag of
Great Britain.  This he fastened to the end of a stick, and commenced waving
it about as a signal to the admiral of his presence in the road.

     At this moment, too, it happened, fortunately for Jack Pringle, as he
considered, that a man came across a stile in the immediate vicinity where 
he
was with a gun in his hand.

     "Hilloa, friend," said Jack Pringle, "just let me look at that gun a
minute."

     "I'll see you further first," said the man; "you seem to me as if you
were out of your mind."

     So saying, he levelled the piece at some birds which were flying
over-head, and fired first one barrel adn then the other in rapid 
succession.

     "Thank ye," said Jack, "that was all I wanted; and it will answer my
purpose exactly; there is nothing like, when you display your flag, firing a
gun or two.  It's all right-- he sees me, he sees me."

     The admiral had actually been looking from the window of the carriage,
although he had not expected to see Jack quite so soon; but the appearance 
of
the handkerchief, which was made so much to resemble a flag, convinced him 
of
the fact that Jack had come that distance to meet them; and when he heard 
the
gun fired twice, he was quite delighted, and leaning back in the carriage, 
he
cried, --

     "Ah, Flora, my dear, it is a great pity that Jack is so given to rum, 
for
he is a remarkably clever fellow.  You would hardly believe it, now, but he
has contrived to hoist a flag just because he sees me coming."

     "Indeed, uncle."

     "Yes, my dear, he has; and didn't you hear that he actually managed to
fire a couple of guns, some way or another?"

     "I certainly did hear the report, but had no idea that we were indebted
to Jack Pringle's management for them."

     "Oh, yes, I can see him a short distance ahead.  He is lying to, now; 
and,
if the wind wasn't against us, we should be up to him in a few minutes, but
don't you feel it blowing in your face?"

     Nothwithstanding the admiral considered, which he certainly did, that 
the
wind was a real impediment to the progress of the carriage, they did in a 
few
moments reach to where Jack Pringle was waiting, when the admiral called out
from the window in a loud voice, --

     "Hilloa! what ship, and where are you bound to?"

     "The Jack Pringle," was the reply, "from Anderbury, and to fall in with
the Admiral Bell, convoy of the pretty Flora."

     "There now," said the admiral; "didn't I tell you what a clever fellow
Jack was?  What shore-going humbug, who had never been to sea, would have
thought of such a thing?"

     "Well," said Jack, as he walked up to the coach window, for the
postilions had been ordered to halt, or, as the admiral had expressed it, 
"to
heave to," "well, here you are, all of you."

     "Yes, Jack," said the admiral; "and I was just saying I thought you a
very clever fellow."

     "I am sorry I can't return the compliment, you poor old creature," said
Jack; "I hope you haven't got yourself into any trouble since I have been 
away
from you.  What a miserable old hulk you do look, to be sure.  There you go,
again; now you are getting into a passion, as usual; what a dreadful thing
temper is, to be sure, when you can't manage it."

     Jack scrambled up behind into the rumble before the admiral could make
any reply to him, for indignation stopped his utterance a moment or two; 
and,
when he did speak, it was to Flora he addressed himself more particularly,
saying, --

     "Now, did you ever know a more ungrateful son-of-a-gun than that?  
After
I had just told him that I thought him a clever fellow, for him to burst out
abusing me at that rate!  Now I have done with him."

     "Oh, you may depend, Admiral Bell," said Flora, "that he don't at all
mean what he says; and I am convinced that he entertains for you the highest
possible respect, and that he is only jesting when he uses those expressions
which would seem as if it were otherwise."

     "Let's just wait," said the admiral, "till the wedding is over, and 
then
I'll let him know whether a boatswain is to make a joke of an admiral of the
fleet.

 Next Week: The Baron's Preparation for the Marriage, and the Wedding 
Morning.




                               CHAPTER CXVIII.

THE BARON'S PREPARATIONS FOR THE MARRIAGE, AND THE WEDDING MORNING.


     During this time neither Mrs. Williams nor the Baron Stolmuyer were 
idle
spectators of the progress of the hours; but, on the contrary, they made the
best possible use of the week which was to elapse before the marrige [sic]
ceremony took place after Helen had given her consent to it.

     Five hundred pounds in the hands of such a person as Mrs. Williams, 
will
go a long way, and produce an amazing amount of show and glitter; so that 
she
managed, before the day on which the ceremony was to be performed arrived, 
to
make quite certain that herself and her daughters would present a most
dazzling appearance; and she thought it not at all improbable that even at 
the
very church some meritorious individual might be dazzled into thinking of
matrimony with one of her other daughters, upon seeing what a brilliant
appearance they managed to present upon the marriage of Helen.

     "I am quite sure that no harm can come of it," she said, "if no good 
does;
and, at all events if no good is done at the church, the baron will soon be
giving parties enough to bring out the dear girls to perfection, 
particularly
as I fully intend we shall all live at Anderbury House."

     Mrs. Williams considered this as a settled point, whether the baron 
liked
it or not; and, knowing as she did the gentle and quiet disposition of 
Helen,
she did not doubt for a moment of being permitted to rule completely over 
the
domestic affairs of her establishment.  All this was amazingly satisfactory 
to
such a lady as Mrs. Williams, and the very thing of all others she would 
have
liked, had she been looking out for what would please her in the marriage of
her daughter.

     We shall shortly see how these views and opinions were verified by the
fact.

     All the other preparations were left to the baron; and when he wrote a
letter to Mrs. Williams, saying, that he would be ready by ten o'clock on 
the
morning which had been named for the nuptials, and would send one of his
carriages for the bride, Mrs. Williams was perfectly satisfied that all was
quite correct.

     There was no very good excuse for calling at Anderbury House; but, if 
she
had then called, she certainly would have been astonished at the 
preparations
which the baron was making for that day which was so near at hand.

     It was quite terrific the expense he went to; and the gorgeous manner 
in
which he fitted up one of the largest apartments in the house for a dance
looked really like expenditure of the most reckless character, and such as
indeed it must have required an immense fortune to withstand.

     The walls of that apartment were hung with crimson draperies of a rich
texture, and such beauty of design that they were the admiration of the very
workmen themselves who were employed upon the premises.

     Then the magnificent order he gave for a feast upon the occasion, and 
the
wines he laid in, really almost exceeded belief; and such proceedings were
indeed highly calculated to give people most exaggerated versions regarding
his wealth.

     He had indeed mentioned to Mrs. Williams, that he had silver mines on
some of his estates abroad; and that fact to her mind was quite sufficient 
to
account for any amount of money he might possess, because, to her ideas of
geology and mineralogy, the discovery of a silver mine meant, finding a hole
of immense width and depth, crammed with the precious metal.

     But be this as it may, and whether the Baron Stolmuyer, of Saltzburgh,
owed his wealth to silver mines, or to other sources, one thing was quite
clear, and that was, that he had it.

     And that was the grand point; for in a highly civilized and evangelical
country like this, the question of how a man got his money is not near so
often asked, as, has he got it; and it is quite amazing what liberality of
feeling and sentiment is immediately infused into people by the fact of
successful speculation of any kind; while failure immediately incurs the
greatest of opprobium and contempt.

     And now the day was so close at hand, that Mrs. Williams got into a
terrible flutter of spirits, and began really to wish it over; for she was
completely ready, and each minute became an hour of impatience to her.

     She was continually bothering the baron with notes and messages upon
different subjects, and he had the urbanity to answer two or three of them;
but he soon left that off, and the last half dozen, at the least, were, to
Mrs. Williams's great mortification, taken no notice of at all.

     Some of these notes were upon the most nonsensical points, and several 
of
them, although they did not actually ask it, pretty strongly hinted that 
more
money would be a very desirable thing.

     The baron would not understand any hint, however, upon the subject; so
Mrs. Williams became fully convinced that she must make the best of it she
could, and put up for the present with the five hundred pounds she had 
already
received.

     But when the day had actually dawned on when the suspicious event was 
to
come off, and, upon looking around her, she found herself surrounded by gay
apparel and jewellery, she almost dreaded that even yet it would turn out to
be some delusion, or a dream, for she could scarcely believe in the reality 
of
such glory and magnificence belonging to her.

     But facts are stubborn things, and, whether for good or for evil, are 
not
likely to be got over; so, when she looked out of the windows and saw that a
bright morning's sun was shining, and that the life, animation, and bustle 
of
the day was commencing, she told herself that it was, indeed, real, and that
she had reached very nearly the summit of her desires and expectations.

     "Yes," she exclaimed; "I shall be mother-in-law to a baron; and I dare
say I shall have at least twenty servants in Anderbury House to command and
control continually."

     A more gratifying reflection than this could not possibly have 
presented
itself to Mrs. Williams; for if any one thing could be more delightful than
another, it certainly was that kind of petty power which gives an individual 
a
control over a large establishment.

     After she had arisen on that eventful morning, she did not allow her
establishment many minutes' repose; but, in the course of half-an-hour, all
was bustle, excitement, and no small share of confusion.

     And while she was thus energetically pushing on her preparations, let 
us
see what the Bannerworths are about, now that they have fairly arrived at
Anderbury, and are in readiness, probably, to be present at the ceremony.

     By Flora's intercession, a peace was established between Jack and the
admiral; and the former took the latter down to the old seaman's cottage, in
order to introduce him to James Anderson; and on the road he made him
acquainted with the particulars of the young man's story; at the same time
informing him of the wish that Anderson had expressed to be permitted to 
join
their party.

     "Oh, certainly," said the admiral," certainly; let him come by all 
means,
although I must say that he ought to leave for London, at once, with his
despatches, or at all events with the news that he had lost them.  However, 
I
am not on active service; and, therefore, have no right to do anything more
than advise him in the matter."

     "Oh, he will go," said Jack, "as soon as he has seen his sweetheart, 
and
perhaps kicked the baron; for though he said he wouldn't, I live in hopes 
yet
that he will be aggravated enough to do it."

     The admiral liked James Anderson so much, that he not only promised him
he should go to the wedding under cover of the general invitation which he,
the admiral, had received, but he proposed, likewise, that he should come 
home
with him at once and be introduced to the Bannerworths; and by home he meant
the inn at Anderbury, where they were staying.

     The young man expressed himself highly gratified at this invitation, 
and
at once accepted it, so that they walked towards the inn together, and began
to make preparations for their appearance at Anderbury House.

     Flora and the Bannerworths, as well as Charles, received young Anderson
very graciously, and they each expressed to him their sympathy for the 
painful
situation in which the baron's marriage was placing him.

     Flora and Charles Holland, as may be well supposed, could both feel, 
and
feel acutely too for any one crossed in his affection, as poor James 
Anderson
was; and it certainly much damped the satisfaction they had in going to what
everybody told them would certainly be the most brilliant wedding that had
taken place in that part of the country for many a year.

     "Let us hope," said Henry Bannerworth, "that you will find some other,
Mr. Anderson, who will be more worthy of your esteem, then [sic] she who has
treated so lightly your affection and her own faith."

     "I know not," said Anderson, "whether to accuse her not; for who knows
but after all she may be the victim of treachery, notwithstanding the 
apparent
powerful evidence that has been given to me by her mother?"

     The Bannerworth family were determined, and so was the admiral, that 
they
would bestow what credit they could upon those who had so kindly invited 
them;
and, accordingly, when they started for the Hall in the handsome carriage
which had brought them down to Anderbury, they certainly presented a rather
showy and attractive appearance.

     But still when they reached the entrance to Anderbury House, they found
that their's was by no means the only equipage of the kind that was there to 
be
seen; for although both the entrances were open for the reception of guests,
they had to wait a considerable time before they could get up to either of
them.

     One hundred and fifty guests, sixty or eighty of whom kept equipages, 
were
calculated to make some little degree of confusion; but when the Bannerworth
family fairly got within the house, everything else was forgotten in their
admiration of the brilliant arrangements within.

     The richest carpets were laid down that money could purchase, and 
servants
in gorgeous liveries ushered the guests into an immense hall, in which the
marriage ceremony was to take place, and which was decorated with a 
splendour
that was perfectly regal.

     And here a new set of domestics glided noiselessly about with various
refreshments upon silver salvers, and the place began rapidly to fill with
such an assemblage of wealth, and beauty, and rank, as perhaps scarcely ever
had been congregated in one place before.

     But among those whose beauty attracted much attention, we may need well
reckon our friend, Flora Bell, as she was now properly called, and whose 
sweet
countenance was the cause of many a passing obersvation, couched in the most
flattering terms.

     It wanted yet an hour to the time of the ceremony being performed, and
the Bannerworths, as they saw that their companion, young Anderson, was in a
painful state of excitement, all sat down in the deep recess of a large 
window
to wait the coming of the bride and bridegroom.

     "I don't think, Mr. Anderson," said Henry, "that your coming here at 
all
was a well advised step; but since you are here, you should muster up
resolution enough not to betray any feeling."

     "I will not betray it, although I feel it," said Anderson.  "Rely upon 
it,
that I shall look much firmer, and act much firmer when she whom I wish to 
see
is actually here, than I do at present-- I am enduring suspense now, and 
that
is the worst of all."

     "I do wish," interposed Flora, "that you had seen her whom you love
before this ceremony, for in that case, although you might have endured the
pang of finding that she was willing to call herself another's, you would 
have
been spared the pain of this day's proceeding."

     "I wish to Heaven I had seen her; but I knew not how to arrange such a
meeting; and when I was shewn, in her own handwriting-- which I knew too 
well
to doubt-- a consent to be the wife of another, I no longer had the spirit 
and
the perseverance to ask to see her; and it was an afterthought that made me
wish to look upon her face once more before I left her for ever."

     "What," said Jack Pringle, suddenly making his appearance, "is he
gammoning you with his feelings?"

     "Oh! so you have got in, have you?" said the admiral.

     "So I have got in-- why, what do you mean by that?  Of course I have 
got
in; wasn't I invited?  I do think you get a little stupider every day; and, 
in
course of time, you won't know what you are about.  I should not be 
surprised
to see you take out your handkerchief to blow your eye instead of your 
nose."

     Latterly, Jack, when he made one of these speeches, always walked away
very quickly, leaving the admiral's anger to evaporate as best it might; so
that he escaped the retort which otherwise he might have received.

 Next Week: A Rather Strange Circumstance at the Baron's Wedding.




                                CHAPTER CXIX.

A RATHER STRANGE CIRCUMSTANCE AT THE BARON'S WEDDING.


     At length, the hour came, so anxiously looked for and expected by all 
the
Baron Stolmuyer's guests; and the great clock which was in one of the 
turrets
of Anderbury House proclaimed that the minute had arrived when all was
presumed to be ready for the union.

     All eyes were directed to a large table that was placed at one 
extremity
of the hall, and covered with crimson velvet, and at which the ceremony was 
to
be performed.

     The Bannerworths were a little forward, so that they commanded a good
view of everything, and James Anderson was completely hidden from 
observation
behind the bulky form of the admiral.  Now, a small door opened, and an
archdeacon somebody -- who had been engaged, as you would engage a 
celebrated
performer, at some theatre, to perform the ceremony -- made his appearance,
accompanied by several ladies and gentlemen, whom he had brought with him to
partake of some of the baron's good things.

     In a few moments, from another doorway, came the bride, accompanied by
six bridesmaids, but she was covered with such a massive lace veil from her
head to her feet, that not the slightest vestige of her countenance was
visible.

     But, still, Flora thought that, as the bride first came in, she heard
from beneath that veil a deep and agonized sob; and she re[marked] the
circumstance to Charles, who confirmed her opinion by at once saying, --

     "It was so, and I don't think it at all likely that we should both be
mistaken."

     There was a slight murmur of applause and admiration among the 
assembled
guests as the bride took her seat by the table; for although there were many
there who had never seen her face, there were likewise many who had; and 
even
those who had not, could not but perceive, by her graceful movements and the
delicate outline of her figure, that they were looking upon a creature of 
rare
beauty and worth.

     It was astonishing that the bridegroom should be late, and the audience
who were present began to be indignant at such a fact, and whispered 
together
concerning it in language not very flattering to the baronet, who, had he
heard it, would have found that he must mind what he was about, or his 
rapidly-acquired popularity would soon be at a discount.

     Minute after minute thus passed, and Mrs. Williams, who was attired in 
a
richly-flowing garment of white silk, embroidered with flowers, began to be 
in
a most particular fidget.

     "Where could be the baron-- good God! where is the baron?" and some one
or two said, "D--n the baron!"  When suddenly the door at which the bride 
had
entered was again flung open, and two servants in rich liveries made their
appearance, one standing on each side of it.  Then there was heard 
approaching
a slow and measured footstep, and presently, attired in a court suit of rich
velvet, the Baron Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh appeared in the hall, and marched 
up
to the table.

     He had but just time to execute half a bow to the assembled multitude,
when Admiral Bell called out in a voice that awakened every echo in the
place, --

     "It's Varney, the vampyre, by G-d!"

                *              *              *              *

     Yes, it was Varney-- the bold, reckless, audacious Varney, who had thus
come out in a new character, and, with vast pecuniary resources, acquired
Heavens knows how or where, was seeking to ally himself to one so young and
beautiful as Helen Williams.

     We do absolutely and positively despair of giving an adequate idea to 
the
reader of the scene that followed.

     Ladies shrieked -- the bride fainted -- Mrs. Williams went into strong
hysterics, and kicked everybody -- Jack Pringle shouted until he was hoarse;
while Varney turned and made a dash to escape through the door at which he 
had
just entered.

     James Anderson, however, by springing over a table, succeeded in
clutching him by the collar behind; but Varney turned on the instant, and
lifting him from the ground as if he had been a child, he flung him among a
tray of confectionary and wine, and from thence he rolled into Mrs. 
Williams's
lap.

     Following close, however, upon the footsteps of Anderson in pursuit of
Varney had been Henry Bannerworth; but he accomplished nothing, except to
strike his head violently against the door through which Varney escaped, and
which was dashed in his face, and immediately bolted on the other side.

     "He is a vampyre," shouted the admiral -- "I tell you all he is a
vampyre-- Varney, the vampyre, and no more a baron than I am a broomstick. 
Stop that d--d old woman from making such a noise."

     "It's the bride's mother," said somebody.

     "What's that to me?" roared the admiral; "it don't make her a bit less 
of
a nuisance.  I offer a hundred pounds reward for Varney, the vampyre; and
there must be some people here that know the house well enough to catch 
him."

     "Do you mean a hundred pounds for master, sir?" said a great footman,
with yellow plush breeches.

     "Yes, I do, you hog in armour," said the admiral.

     The footman rushed through another doorway in a moment, and then Jack
Pringle jumped upon a chair, and, waving his hat, cried, --

     "Hurra, hurra, hurra!  Three cheers for old Varney!  I'll tell you what
it is, messmates, he is the meanest fellow as ever you see; and as for you
ladies who have been disappointed of the marriage, I'll come and kiss you 
all
in a minute, and we'll drink up old Varney's wine, and eat up his dinner 
like
bricks.  My eye, what a game we will have, to be sure.  I am coming----"

     At this moment the admiral gave such a kick to one of the hind legs of
the chair, that down came Jack as quickly as if he had disappeared through
some trap-door.

     "Hold your noise, will you," said the admiral, "you great brawling
brute!"

     "I'll settle him," said Mrs. Williams, who had suddenly recovered; and
had not Jack suddenly made his escape, it is highly probable she would have
make him a regular scape-goat in the affair, and that he alone -- for 
Anderson
had pretty quickly escaped her -- would have felt the consequences of her 
deep
disappointment.

     The confusion now became, if anything, worse than at first, for many of
the guests who had looked on apparently quite stunned and paralyzed at what
had taken place, now recovered, and joined their voices to the general 
clamour.

     Some, to rush out of the place, took the opportunity of going through 
the
different rooms; while a number, who had heard of the wide-spread fame of
Varney, the vampyre, and who were utterly astonished to find him and the 
baron
one and the same person, joined in the pursuit, with the hope of taking
prisoner so alarming a personage.

     No one knew for some time what had become of the clergyman, until Jack
Pringle saw a human foot sticking out from under the table, upon which he
took hold of it, and with a pull dragged the archdeacon somebody fairly out,
to the great horror of some very religious old ladies who were present, who
considered that an arch-deacon must be somebody very wonderful indeed.

     "Hilloa! Mr. Parson," said Jack; I suppose you thought it was your old
friend the devil come for you before your time; but cheer up, I know him; 
it's
only a vampyre, and that's nothing when you're used to it."

     Jack did not seem at all to think that it was necessary he should 
assist
in the capture of Varney, and probably the real fact was, he did not care
whether Varney was captured or not, so he walked to one of the tables which
were loaded with refreshments, and knocking the neck off a bottle of 
champagne,
he gave a nod to Mrs. Williams, saying, --

     "Come, old girl, take something to drink.  That red nose of yours looks
as if you knew something of the bottle.  It's only me, so you needn't be 
shy. 
Ah, it's devilish good wine, though.  I do give old Varney credit for 
getting
up the thing decently, which he certainly has, and no mistake."

     "Who has seen my daughter?  Where is my daughter?" cried Mrs. Williams,
as she looked about her in vain for Helen.

     "You needn't trouble yourself, ma'am," said the admiral; "she has just
walked off with a little fellow of the name of Anderson, who, although he 
was
no match for Varney, the vampyre, I think will turn out to be one for your
daughter."

     Mrs. Williams was thoroughly thunder-stricken, and she sat down in a
chair, and commenced wringing her hands, muttering as she did so, --

     "Oh, that I should have lived to see this day.  Oh, that I should have
existed to be so-- so----"

     "Jolly well humbugged, ma'am," said Jack Pringle, "with a vampyre,
instead of a baron; why, lord bless you, ma'am, nobody in their senses would
have taken old Varney for a baron; why, he is a regular old blood-sucker, he
is, and a nice family you would have had; but, however, if you are fond of 
him,
you can marry him yourself, you know, now; and I shouldn't at all wonder, 
but
he will consent, for a man will put up with any d--d old cat, when he finds 
he
can't get a better."

     "Good God," said Mrs. Williams, "I think I know your voice now; ain't 
you
Admiral Green?"

     "Avast, there," said Jack; "I ain't anything of the kind; they calls me
Colonel Bluebottle, of the horse-marines."

     "The what?"

     "The horse-marines.  Didn't you never hear of them, ma'am?"

     "I certainly never did.  But don't try to deceive me, sir; you are
Admiral Green and if you will, my dear sir, spare me a few minutes of your
valuable time, I shall be able to explain to you----"

     "What?" said Jack.

     "Why, that really-- you will scarcely believe it-- but really, Admiral
Green, my daughter Julia is, although I say it, one of the best of girls."

     "Oh, I dare say she is, ma'am; but I don't know as that much matters to
me."

     "Excuse me, Admiral Green, but it really does, and you must know-- of
course it's quite between ourselves this-- that she happened to see you when
you did me the honour of calling upon me."

     "Did she really?"

     "Yes, my dear admiral; and, do you know, ever since then she has been
positively raving about you; and as you were good enough to say, the baron
should not stand in the way of your affections, allow me to recommend Julia 
to
you."

     "Oh, that's it, is it!" said Jack.  "Well, ma'am, I should not have 
said
no, only that you ain't half particular enough for me!"

     "Not particular!  Oh, good God."

     "No, ma'am, you ain't.  Here you would have married one of your 
daughters
to a vampyre, and how do I know waht other sort of odd fish you might bring
into the family."

     "But, my dear Admiral---"

     "Oh! gammon.  I tell you what, now, I will do-- I don't mind standing
something devilish handsome, if you will marry old Varney yourself."

     "What! the baron that was, and the vampyre that is?  I marry him!  Oh,
dear, no, I really could not-- that is to say, how much would you give,
Admiral Green?"

     "Ah!" said Jack, "I knew it.  Who says, after this, that women won't
marry the very devil himself, if they only have the chance.  And now, Mother
Williams, I'll just tell you what you have done.  The fact is, I took a 
fancy
to you myself, and that's why I came here at all to-day.  I meant to have
proposed to you, and if you had only said you would not have the Baron 
Vampyre
for any money, d--n it, I would have had you myself, and settled a matter of
15,000 a-year upon you."

     "Oh, gracious Providence! what do I hear?"

     "Just what I says.  I'm a man of my word, ma'am, and would have done 
it."

     "Mrs. Williams was so affected at the chance she had lost, that she 
quite
forgot to look after Helen, but was actually compelled to indulge herself 
with
a glass or two of something strong and powerful, which she said was sherry,
but which somebody else said was brandy, in order to recover from the faint
feeling that would come over her.

     After this, Jack thought he had had about the bitterest revenge upon 
Mrs.
Williams that it was possible to achieve, and he was quite right as far as
that went.  The old admiral, too, who overheard some part of the colloquy, 
was
quite delighted with it, and again told himself what a clever fellow Jack 
was,
and quite a wonderful character in his way.

     "Ah!" he said, " one would have to sail a tolerable lot of voyages 
before
finding anybody as was exactly Jack's equal; and I'll be hanged if I don't
forgive him for the next piece of mutinous conduct he is guilty of, on 
account
of the way he has served out that horrid old Mother Williams; for in all my
life I never saw a woman I disliked more.  Stop, what am I saying?  Did I
really forget Mrs. Chillingworth, the doctor's wife?  That was too bad."

 Next Week: The Hunt for the Vampyre in the Subterranean Passage.





                                CHAPTER CXX.

THE HUNT FOR THE VAMPYRE IN THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE.


     The information that had been given to Mrs. Willams respecting her
daughter and James Anderson having together left the great hall of Anderbury
House, was perfectly correct.

     The voice of Anderson, whispering words of affection in the ear of 
Helen,
was sufficient to arouse her from the state of syncope into which she had
fallen; and when she recovered and looked in his face, the expression of joy
which her countenance wore, at once dispelled all his doubts.

     "Helen, dear Helen!" he whispered; "are you, indeed, still, in heart,
mine?"

     "Still, as ever," she replied.

     "Come with me; I have much to tell you; and we need not heed the 
thoughts
and feelings of the throng that is here.  If you can walk, place your arm in
mine, and lean upon me, and we will get out of all this trouble and 
confusion."

     Helen was but too glad to avail herself of such an offer, and she
accordingly at once did so; and leaning for support upon that arm, which, of
all others, she most loved to bear upon, they together passed out of the 
great
hall, through one of the numerous doorways leading from it.

     Being both of them quite ignorant of what may be called the topography 
of
Anderbury House, they went on till they came to a small but very elegant
apartment, in which a table was laid with wines, and some costly 
refreshments,
which, from the fact of an extremely clerical-looking shovel hat being upon
one of the chairs, there was no great difficulty in coming to the conclusion
that this had been a reception-room, got up purposely for the reverend
gentleman who was to perform the ceremony of marriage between the baron and
Miss Williams, and in which he had refreshed himself prior to the 
performance
of that dreadfully arduous task, for which, no doubt, as all persons are, he
was so very insufficiently paid.

     A glass of wine, which James Anderson poured out for Helen, tended much
to recover her; and then he said to her in accents of the greatest 
affection,
--

     "Helen-- Helen! is it possible that you really so far forgot me, as to
promise your hand to another?"

     She burst into tears as she clung to his arm, saying, --

     "I know you cannot, you ought not to forgive me.  I did promise; but I
did not forget you; and if you know the cruel persecution to which I have 
been
subjected, you would pity, perhaps, as much as you condemn me."

     "You did not know that some days since I wrote you a note."

     "Me a note?  Oh, heavens! no-- no.  What became of it?  To whom did you
entrust it?  Oh! James, had I but thought you were near me, do you think 
that
for one moment I would have yielded, even to the representations which were
made to me?"

     "I see it all," he said.  "Your mother has carried on this matter with
more tact than candour and honesty of purpose.  I do not condemn you, dear
Helen; and no one shall ever disturb you in your possession of a heart which
is wholly yours."

     "And can you forget---"

     "All but that I love you I can and will forget, Helen."

     "I do not deserve this noble generosity, for I ought not to have 
yielded,
James.  I feel that I ought to have clung to the remembrance of your 
affection,
and found in that an abundant consolation, as well as abundant strength, to
resist the whole world."

     "Say no more, dearest, upon that head; but let us, to the full, enjoy 
the
happiness of this meeting, without the drawback of a single doubt."

     "We will never part again."

     "Never-- never."

     "But, James, what was the meaning of that sudden exclamation, from one 
of
the guests, as regarded the baron?"

     "You allude to Admiral Bell proclaiming him to be a vampyre; and, I 
must
say, it fills me with quite as much astonishment as it can you.  I did hear 
a
strange story of that sort from a sailor a short time ago, but I looked upon
it as a mere superstition and paid no attention to it.  You know what it 
means,
I presume, and that a vampyre is supposed to be a half-supernatural creature
who supports a spurious and horrible existence, by feeding upon the blood of
any one whom he can make his victim."

     "If this horrible superstition," said Helen, with a shudder, "be true,
what a dreadful fate have I escaped!"

     "It surely must be some error of judgement; but still, dear one, you 
have
escaped a dreadful fate, a fate worse than any vampyre would have inflicted
upon you-- the fate of being united to one whom you cannot love."

     "Yes," said Helen; "that is, indeed, an escape; but how came you, of 
all
persons in the world, a guest here?"

     "I came, Helen, under cover of a general invitation, with a most worthy
family, to whose kindness I feel myself much indebted, and which empowered
them to bring with them whom they pleased.  My wish and object was to take 
one
last look at the face I had loved so well before I left you for ever."

     "Oh, Heavens!" said Helen, "and I was so near being sacrificed while 
you
were by.  Even now I shudder at the dreadful chasm; I feel that you ought 
not
to forgive me."

     "Say no more-- say no more; all that, Helen, is now past and forgotten,
and I can well imagine how your mother would torture you with supplications,
because she believed this man to be rich, and consequently the sort of 
person,
above all others, as most desirable for her to have as a son-in-law.  We 
will
only consider that a great anxiety and a great danger has passed away, and 
we
will not stop to ask ourselves what it was."

     "Ever good, and ever generous," resumed Helen, as her head reposed upon
her lover's breast.

     "Oh," said Jack Pringle, as he popped his head in at the door; "I beg
your pardon, you are better engaged; but we are going to have a grand 
vampyre
hunt through the house, and I thought you would like to join in it, 
perhaps."

     "Stay a moment, stay," cried Anderson.  "Do you mean to tell me, 
really,
that this is the person who gave your friends, the Bannerworths, so much
trouble and inconvenience?"

     "Yes, I do," said Jack; "lor bless you, he is quite an old acquaintance
of ours, is old Varney; sometimes he hunts us, sometimes we hunt him.  He is
rather a troublesome acquaintance, notwithstanding, and I think there are a
good many people in the world, a jolly right worse vampyres than Varney."

     "I have no cause to hunt him," said Anderson, "and so, therefore, I 
feel
certainly more inclined to decline, than otherwise, engaging in such a
transaction."

     "Don't mention it," said Jack; "you are a deuced deal better engaged, 
and
there needs no excuses."

     Jack was quite correct as regarded the projected hunt for the 
unfortunate
Varney in Anderbury House; for the liberal offer of reward which the admiral
had made to any one who would secure him, was calculated to stimulate every
possible exertion that people could make upon the occasion; so much so, 
indeed,
that the Bannerworths, after a brief consultation among themselves, thought
that for the protection of Varney it would be much better that they should
find him, than now leave him with the character that had been given him as
such a dangerous member of society.

     The servants, and some of the guests, even, had gone very 
systematically
to work for the purpose of taking Varney prisoner; for, in the first 
instance,
they had secured all the outlets from the house, so that, as the footman 
with
the yellow plush continuations remarked, he must jump over the cliff if he
wanted to get away.

     The admiral and Henry agreed with each other that they would be 
foremost
in the search, in order to protect Varney from any violence; for although 
this
conduct of his might be considered as very bad, and an outrage upon society 
in
passing himself off as a baron, and endeavouring to effect an alliance with 
a
young and innocent girl, yet they, the Bannerworths, had nothing to complain
of in the transaction whatever.

     Consequently was it that they felt an inclination to defend Varney from
personal violence.

     And this was, to a certain extent, to be dreaded, because Anderbury 
being
so short a distance from Bannerworth, it was not to be supposed but that 
some
news of the mysterious appearance of the vampyre had reached the ears of
almost every one who happened to be present at the baron's wedding.

     And although these persons might be supposed to belong to a class of
society not likely to commit acts of violence, yet there was no knowing 
what,
in the excitement of the moment, might be done.

     While the search went on, Flora was introduced to Helen Williams, and
remained with her, commencing a friendship which lasted afterwards, to the
great advantage of Helen, for many a year.

     The Bannerworths would have been pleased and interested at going over
Anderbury House, under any other circumstances than the present one, for 
truly
the baron had made it a most magnificent abode.

     By judicious additions to the antique furniture which had belonged to 
it
when he took it, he had made some of the apartments look gorgeous in the
extreme; and while he had not disturbed the character of the decorations, he
had certainly shown a very fine taste in adding to them.

     But their minds were by far too much occupied with considerations
connected with Varney to pay much attention to his house; and, as they
traversed room after room in search of him without finding him, they began 
to
think that, with his usual good fortune, he had contrived entirely to 
escape.

     The servants, who knew the place well, perhaps better than Varney did
himself, searched for him in almost impossible places, until it began to be
the general opinion that he must have escaped.

     They were standing by a large bay window, which commanded a view of the
gardens, when one of the servants suddenly exclaimed, --

     "I see him-- I see him; there he goes," and pointed into the garden,
where, for one instant, Henry Bannerworth, as well as the admiral, saw 
Varney,
in his rich suit of wedding apparel, dart from among the bushes, towards a
summer-house that was in the garden near at hand.

     "Tis he, indeed," said Henry.  "Let us get down instantly, or he may 
yet
effect his escape."

     "No, no," cried one of the servants, "he cannot do that; the garden 
wall
is too high, and the men are stationed at the gate.  It's quite clear to me
what he is about.  Look at him; he is going towards the old passage that 
leads
to the sea shore."

     "Then he will escape, of course," said Henry, "for no one can hope to
overtake him."

     "Don't you be afraid of that, sir," cried the servant; "one of my mates
has gone round to the beach to watch, and he won't let the door be opened 
that
leads out on to the sands, so he cannot get away by that mode."

     "In that case, then, we have him completely entrapped, and, as you say,
he cannot escape.  It must be the madness of positive desperation that 
induces
him to go to that place."

     "Let us be off at once after him," said the admiral; "that is our only
plan.  Come on at once.  The sooner we get hold of him the better, for his 
own
sake as well as for ours."

     Thus urged, they all proceeded towards the garden, in which was the
mysterious, well-like entrance to the subterraneous passage, which formed so
great a feature in the estate of Anderbury, on the moment, and which, at the
time that Varney had taken the mansion, had evidently formed to him one of 
its
principal attractions.

     To the admiral and his party, as well as to several of the guests, who
joined from motives of curiosity in the pursuit for Varney, this place was
perfectly new, and it certainly, to look down it, did not present by any
means an inviting prospect; for although it sloped sufficiently to take off
the absolute appearance of being a downright hole in the earth, yet, beyond 
a
few feet in depth, the gloom had something positively terrific about it.

     "Well," said the admiral, "I've been into the hold of many a ship, but
never one that looked half so gloomy as this, I can say.  What do you say to
it, Jack?"

     "It's no use saying anything to such places," said Jack.  "The only 
way,
if we want to catch old Varney, which I suppose we do, is to pop down it at
once and done with it; so come along, I won't flinch if it was ten times 
worse. 
Come on, admiral, let's go down after the enemy."

     "I cannot say it's exactly the kind of place I admire," said the 
admiral;
"but, howsomedever, if one must go down it, who shall say that Admiral Bell
flinched from it?  Come on, all of you.  Let all who will follow."

     The passage did not look a very inviting one; and it was found that the
courage of the guests began to cool down wonderfully when, instead of 
rushing
from apartment to apartment, in search of Varney, the vampyre, they found 
that
they had to encounter the gloom and darkness of that underground abode.

     Out of the positive throng which had been pursuing Varney, only four, 
in
addition to the admiral and the male portion of his party, ventured to 
descend
into that black-looking place.

     "What!" cried Jack, "have we got such a lot of skulkers whenever we 
come
to close quarters with the enemy?  Well, shiver my timbers, if I didn't 
expect
as much from a lot of land lubbers, who don't know what they are about any
more than a marine in a squall.  But who cares?  Come along, admiral; and, 
if
we do have all the fighting, we shall, at all events, have all the glory."

     "I hope there will be nothing of the one, at all events," said Henry;
"for my intention is rather to save Varney from injury than to injure him.

     "We must have lights," said the admiral.  "I don't mind going down into 
a
queer place to look for Varney, but I must have the means of seeing what I 
am
about when I get there."

     "They will be here, sir, directly," said the big footman, who from the
first had made himself conspicuous in the pursuit of Varney; that is to say,
ever since the reward of 100 had been offered by the admiral to any one who
would take him prisoner.

     And in a few moments, some of the links, which were always kept in the
kitchen of Anderbury House, for the express purpose of descending into the
subterraneous passages with, were produced and lighted.  By this time, too,
the four guests had decreased to three, and two of those seemed to hang back
rather a little; while one of them seemed disposed to make up as much as
possible for any deficiency of courage on the part of the others, by 
declaring
his intention of ferretting out Varney, let him be hidden where he might.

     "I am with you, sir," he said to the admiral, "let this place lead 
where
it may; for I have heard so much about vampyres, and really am so curious to
know more about them."

     "You don't believe in them, do you?"

     "I cannot say that I do, sir.  But, at the same time, when we hear such
well authenticated cases brought forward about them, it is very difficult,
indeed, to say at once, that one has no belief in such things."

     "Well, you are right enough there; and if you knew as much about 
Varney,
the vampyre, as we do, I think you would be a little puzzled to know what to
say about him; for I'll be hanged if he don't puzzle me above a bit, and I
don't know now what to think of him."

 Next Week: The Death of the Inquisitive Guest. -- The Escape of Sir Francis
 Varney.




                                CHAPTER CXXI.

THE DEATH OF THE INQUISITIVE GUEST. -- THE ESCAPE OF SIR FRANCIS VARNEY


     The guest who was so valorous, and so very impatient for the capture of
Varney, would have preceded everybody in descending to the passage cut in 
the
cliff, but Henry Bannerworth thought not only was it more particularly his
concern to do so, but that as he knew Varney better, it was desirable that 
he
should go first.

     He thought there would less likelihood of any mischief by adopting such
a kind of procedure, for he did not anticipate that Varney would willingly 
do
him any injury; while, as regarded what he might do if any stranger should
attempt to seize him, that was quite another affair.

     "You do not know him as we know him," said Henry, to the guest.  "He is
a dangerous man, and in all respects such an one as your prudence might well
induce you to keep clear of.  Allow me to precede you, therefore, for the
sake of preventing the probability of the most unpleasant consequences."

     This argument appeared to have its effect and to damp a little the
ardour of this individual, which it might well enough do, without casting 
any
imputation upon his courage whatever; for, after all, he could have no 
strong
motive in the pursuit of Varney, since he was in a line of life which would
have prevented him, even if he had been the sole captor of Varney, from 
taking
the reward which the admiral had offered for his apprehension.

     The sudden change from the daylight, and all the noise and bustle which
had animated the scene above, to the silence, the darkness, and the strange
atmosphere which reigned in the underground region, could not fail of having
some effect upon the imagination of every one present.

     This effect would, of course, vary in different individuals, being the
greatest in those of a highly excitable and imaginative turn of mind, and 
the
less in those who were of a more matter-of-fact kind of intellect.  
Probably,
Henry Bannerworth felt more acutely than any one else the full effect which
such a scene was likely to produce, and he was profoundly silent upon the
occasion for some time.

     Under even the most extraordinary circumstances, the descent into such 
a
place must have affected the mind to some extent, for it seems like leaving
the world altogether for a time, and bidding farewell to everything which we
have been in the habit of enjoying and thinking beautiful.

     No one ever thought of accusing Admiral Bell of being very imaginative;
but, upon this occasion, although he was the first to speak, what he did 
say,
showed that he had felt some of those sensations to which we have alluded.

     "How do you feel, Henry?" he said.  "I'll be hanged if I don't seem as 
if
I were going into my grave before my time."

     "And I, too," said Henry; "but I rather like the solemn feeling which
such a place as this inspires."

     "Gentlemen," said the tall footman with the yellow plush
what-do-you-call-em's, "gentlemen, I think, after all, that I somehow will 
go
back again.  I don't seem, actually, in a manner of speaking, to care to 
catch
the baron, somehow; so, if you please, gentlemen, I rather think I'll go
back."

     "Why don't you say you are afraid, at once, John?" said the admiral.

     "Who, me, sir?  I afraid?  Oh, dear, no, sir.  It would take a trifle,
indeed, to frighten me, I rather think.  Oh! no, no, sir you mistake me.  
It's
my feelings-- it's my feelings, sir."

     "Why, what the deuce have your feelings to do with it?"

     "Everything in the world, sir.  Haven't I drank his beer, sir, and
haven't I eat his beef, and his bread, and his _tatoes_, sir, and shall I 
now
hunt him up among his own ice-wells?  No; perish the thought-- perish the
blessed idea. Perish the-- the-- the-- good bye, gentlemen."

     With these words, the chivalrous footman gave up all idea of continuing
the chase for Varney, the vampyre, and turning quickly, so as to stop the
possibility of his hearing any further remonstrance, he went from the place
with great speed.

     Still, however, with the departure of this individual, whose courage 
from
the first had had about it a very suspicious colour, they were in quite
sufficient strength to have accomplished the capture of the vampyre, if they
could get hold of him, and always provided he was not sufficiently armed 
with
powers of mischief to their number, by taking perchance the life of some one
of them.

     There was one circumstance connected with a search for anybody in that
strange region, which spoke much in favour of a successful result, and that
was that the passage was narrow, and that there were no hiding-places except
the ice-wells, to explore which, at all events, could not be a very 
difficult
task; and as they proceeded, they felt certain that they must be driving
Varney before them.

     Before they had got very far, Henry Bannerworth thought it would be
advisable to announce to Varney the precise intentions of himself and the
admiral, always provided he were equally peaceably inclined, and within
hearing of what was said to him.

     He accordingly raised his voice, inquiring, --

     "Sir Francis Varney, you no doubt recognise, by my tones, that it is
Henry Bannerworth who speaks to you; and therefore you may feel convinced 
that
no harm is intended you; but you are implored to come forth and meet your
friends, who, from former circumstances, you ought to know you can trust."

     There was no reply whatever to this appeal, and when the echoes of
Henry's voice had died away, the same death-like stillness reigned in the
place that had before characterised it.

     "He will not answer," said the admiral; "and yet, if the other end of
this passage be guarded as it is said to be, he must be here.  Let us come 
on
at once-- I have no wish of my own to stay in this damp, chalky hole a 
moment
longer than may be absolutely necessary."

     Nor I," remarked Henry; "so let us proceed, and it will be necessary 
that
we keep an accurate watch upon our progress, for I am told that there are
ice-wells here of great depth, down which you may fall and come by an awful
death when you least expect, unless you are very cautious in looking where 
you
tread."

     "There's no doubt of that, sir," said one of his guests.  "This place 
is
considered to be one of the most curious that Anderbury can boast of, and I
have been told that there are ice-houses, in which all kinds of provisions 
may
be kept with ease and safety in the most violent heat of the summer months."

     After a few moments they came upon one of the ice-wells, which yawned
terrifically before them, and had they not been very careful and watchful
upon the occasion, one or more of them might have been precipitated down the
well, and the loss of life must have been the result.

     "I scarcely think," said Henry, "that ordinary caution has been used in
the construction of these places, or they never would have been left in such 
a
state as they are now in.  The ice-well, you perceive, lies directly in the
very pathway?"

     "Yes," said the admiral, "it does seem so, Master Henry; but if you 
look
a little closer you will perceive that at one time there has been a wooden
bridge exactly over this chasm."

     "Ah, I do, indeed, now perceive such has been the case."

     "Yes, and that made the place both safe and convenient; for no doubt
there was a means of lowering down any baskets of wine or other matters that
required a low temperature."

     The admiral was perfectly right in his supposition, for that was just 
the
way in which the ice-wells of Anderbury House were constructed; and now, 
since
the bridge had been broken down, there was but a very narrow pathway, 
indeed,
by which the well could be passed, unless it was jumped over, which might be
done by any active person.

     They would not pass this ice-well without an examination of it, and 
that
was accomplished by lying down upon the rough pathway of the passage, and
holding a light at arm's-length down it, when the bottom was clearly 
visible.

     "He is not there," said Henry, who was the person who made the
experiment; "he is not there, so we must pass on."

     They accordingly did so, until they came to another such ice-well, and
then the guest which had shown such eagerness in the chase, and accompanied
them so far, went through the process of stooping down the chasm to 
ascertain
if it contained anything unusual beyond the debris of broken bottles, old
flint-stones, &c, which might fairly be expected to be there.

     "Do you see anything?" inquired Henry, as the guest seemed to be 
looking
very intently over the precipice.

     He was about to reply something, for some sound came from his lips, 
when
he suddenly, as if he had been impelled to do by some unseen power, toppled
over the edge and disappeared, torch and all, into the abyss below.

     "Good God!" cried Henry, "he has fallen."

     "Good night," said the admiral, with characteristic coolness; "I 
suspect,
my friend, that your career is at an end."

     "Listen! for God's sake, listen!" cried Henry; "does he speak?"

     There was a strange scuffling noise, and then a low deep groan from the
bottom of the ice-pit, and then all was still; and from the character of the
sound, Henry was of opinion that this well was of much greater depth than 
the
former one, which he had so successfully examined.

     "He has met with his death," said Henry.

     "Don't be too sure," said the admiral; "we must have a good stout rope,
and somebody must go down; if nobody likes the job, I will go myself."

     "If ropes are wanted," said one of the other two persons who were
present, "I can show you where they may be found, for I was at the inquest 
on
the body of the man who was found dead in this place some time ago, and I
marked that the ropes by which his body had been got out of one of the
ice-wells were left where they had been used."

     "That, then, said the other, "is further on, and nearer the beach."

     "Yes; lend me the light, and I will get the rope as quickly as I can; 
for
I don't think, as well as I can remember, that there is another well between
this one and that which is nearer the beach entrance."

     This was done, and for a few moments Henry and the admiral were left in
darkness while the ropes were being searched for.  It was a darkness so 
total
and complete, that it did indeed seem like that darkness which it requires 
but
a little stretch of the imagination to fancy it can be felt.

     "Henry," said the admiral -- "Henry!"

     "Yes; I am here."

     "Were you ever in such a confounded dark hole in all your life?"

     "Scarcely, I think, ever.  It is certainly tremendous, and it is a
grievous thing to think that a life had been sacrificed, as no doubt it has,
in this adventure."

     "Ah, well! we must all go to Davy Jones's locker some day, you-- But--
but don't lay hold of me so!"

     "I lay hold of you!  I am not near you, sir."

     "D--n it! who is it, then?  Somebody has got hold of me as if I were in 
a
vice.  Stand off, I say!  Who are you?"

     "Varney, the vampyre," said a deep sepulchral voice; "who warns you, 
and
all others, that there is abundance of danger in visiting here, and nothing 
to
be gained."

     Almost as these words were spoken, Henry suddenly found himself whirled
round with such force, that it was only by a great effort that he succeeded 
in
keeping his feet, and he felt convinced that some one had passed him.  Who
could that one be but Sir Francis Varney, the much dreaded vampyre?

     In the next moment the light glanced again upon the walls of the
subterranean passage, and the admiral cried, --

     "He has escaped, unless some one stops him above.  But let us think of
nothing else at present, but to find out if the poor fellow who fell down 
here
be alive or dead."

     Henry descended by the assistance of the ropes, and found the 
adventurous
guest quite dead.  They raised the body from the well, and conveying it, as
best they could, among them, they arrived, after some troubles on account of
their burden, in the gardens, and, finally, in the great hall of Anderbury
House, on a table in which they laid the corpse.

     It was quite evident now to the admiral and to the Bannerworths that
Varney had escaped, so they could have no desire to remain at the house, 
over
which Mr. Leek was running like a madman, wondering what he should do.  
Flora
had invited Helen Williams to accompany her to the inn, so that the whole
party of the Bannerworths went away together, with the one addition to it of
that poor girl who had so narrow an escape of becoming the vampyre's bride. 
Horrible destiny!

 Next Week:  Mrs. Williams Visits the Bannerworths at the Inn. -- The 
Marriage
 of James Anderson with Helen.




                               CHAPTER CXXII.

MRS. WILLIAMS VISITS THE BANNERWORTHS AT THE INN. -- THE MARRIAGE OF JAMES
ANDERSON WITH HELEN.


     Let us fancy now, after all these singular circumstances had taken 
place,
the Bannerworth family, with James Anderson and Helen Williams, seated in a
comfortable room at the inn at Anderbury, where they had put up when they 
came
to that place, in pursuance of the invitation they had received from Mrs.
Williams.

     And that lady, probably could she have foreseen what was about to 
occur,
would have taken most especial pains to prevent such an invitation from ever
reaching such a destination; but she had fallen a victim to her own love of
display, and not being content with inviting people whom she did know, she
must, forsooth, give them a _carte blanche_ to bring with them people whom 
she
did not know at all.

     And this it was that she had been horrified by what had taken place, 
and
had had all her brightest visions of the future levelled with the dust.

     When Jack Pringle told Mrs. Williams that he believed she would quite
willingly have sold her daughter to a vampyre, he was right; for she would
have done so, always provided that the vampyre, as aforesaid, had a good
property, and was able to convince her of that most important fact.  The 
only
person of all the little party that was assembled at the inn, who looked 
pale
and anxious, was poor Helen, and she certainly did look so; for when we come
to consider her novel position we shall not wonder at it.

     She had thrown herself completely upon the consideration of strangers,
and was severed from all those natural ties which ought to have for ever 
held
her in their gentle bondage.  But this conduct, or rather the conduct of 
that
one who ought to have protected her though all trouble and anxieties -- her
mother -- had been such as to deprive her of the feeling that she had a home
at all.

     Flora saw that her guest, as indeed she considered Helen, looked sad 
and
dejected, and she made every effort within her power to rescue her from such 
a
state of things.

     "Do not despair of much happiness," she whispered to her; "but rather
thank good fortune, which, at the last moment, rescued you from one whom you
could not love.  Be assured that now you will enjoy the protection of those
who will soon be able to prevail upon your mother to look with a favourable
eye upon any new arrangement."

     "I am much beholden to you," said Helen -- "very much beholden to you,
and I feel that I ought to congratulate myself upon my escape.  But my heart
does feel sad, because the state of things, to avoid which I made myself a
sacrifice, may now ensue in all their terrors."

     "My dear," said the admiral, who overheard her, "don't you believe any
such rubbish as all that.  I have no doubt you have been regularly 
persecuted
into the match with the supposed baron, and you would, perhaps, have found 
out
afterwards that one-half of the things you were told, to induce you to
consent, had no foundation but in somebody's active imagination."

     "Do you think so, sir?"

     "Do I think so!  To be sure I do.  Now, I dare say you were told how, 
if
you married the Baron What's-his-name, you would be doing something 
wonderful
for all your family."

     "Yes-- yes."

     "Oh, of course; I can see through all that clearly enough; and I tell
you, my lass, that you have had a most fortunate escape, and that there is,
and shall be, no reason on the face of the earth why you should not be 
married
to the man of your choice.  He has been to sea, and so, of course, he has
finished what may be called his education.  If he had been on shore all his
life, you might have doubted about the prudence of having him; but, as it 
is,
it's quite another matter."

     "Sir, I thank you for your kind advocacy of my cause," said James
Anderson; "and I shall ever consider, as one of the most fortunate accidents
of my life, the meeting with Admiral Bell."

     "Oh, don't say anything about that.  I know some of the people at the
Admiralty, and when you go to make the report of how you have been
shipwrecked, and how you lost your despatches, I will give you a letter of
introduction, which, I dare say, won't do you any harm."

     "Indeed, sir, this is more kindness than I ought to expect."

     "Not at all, my boy-- not at all.  Don't put yourself out of the way
about that.  Only I tell you what I would do.  You need not take my advice
unless you like; but, if I were you, I'd be hanged if I moved an inch 
anywhere
till I had made Helen Williams my wife."

     "Can you suppose," cried James Anderson, while his eyes sparkled with
delight -- "can you suppose, my dear sir, that such advice could be other 
than
most welcome to me?"

     "And what do you say, Helen, to it?" whispered Flora.

     "What can I say?"

     "You can say yes, I suppose?" said the admiral.

     Helen was silent.

     "Very good," added the admiral.  "When a girl don't say no, of course 
she
means yes; and you can make sure of your prize now you have got her, Master
Anderson.  Let's see; you manage these affairs with what you call a special
license, don't you?"

     "Yes, uncle," said Flora; "that is the way.  You seem to know all about
it, and I almost suspect you really must have had some experience in those
matters."

     "I experience, you little gipsy! -- what do you mean?  I never was
married in all my life, and I don't intend to be."

     "Don't make too sure, uncle.  But, despite all that, no one could more
warmly second your advice to Mr. Anderson than myself."

     "Very good.  For that speech I forgive you.  And now, Mr. Anderson, 
just
come along with me, for I want to say a few words to you which nobody else 
has
anything to do with."

     When the admiral got James Anderson alone, he said to him, --

     "Of course you are without funds, so it's no use making any fuss of
delicacy about it.  I have no doubt but that, with my interest, I shall be
able to get you into an appointment of some sort; but, in the meantime, I 
beg
that you will not cross me in my desire to serve you; and mind, I take your
word of honour to repay me, so, you see, there is no obligation."

     "Sir, this noble generosity----"

     "There, there-- that's quite enough; for the fact is, it ain't noble
generosity at all, so hold your tongue about it, and be so good as to let me
consider that as settled.  Here are fifty pounds for you, which will enable
you to go to London like a gentleman, and to conduct your marriage either 
here
or there, as you may yourself think proper, and as your bride may consent."

     "Sir, I would fain make Helen my own here."

     "Very good.  I don't pretend to understand how to manage these things:
but set about it as quickly as you can, and don't be deterred by anybody."

     This short but, to James Anderson, deeply interesting conversation,
because it relieved his mind from a load of anxiety, took place a few paces
from the inn door only, so that they returned at once; but scarcely had they
joined the rest of the party, and were considering what they should order 
for
dinner, when one of the waiters of the establishment came to say, --

     "If you please, there's a lady who wants to come in.  I asked her her
name, but she won't give it; but she says she must see everybody."

     "The deuce she must!" cried the admiral.  "What sort of a craft is 
she?"

     "Sort of a what, sir?"

     "My fears tell me," sobbed Helen, "that it is my mother."

     The admiral whistled, and then he said, --

     "I suppose we shall have a breeze; but the sooner it's over the better.
Let the lady come in; and don't you be afraid of anything, my lass.  Why, 
you
look as pale as if you expected-- here she is."

     The door was flung open, and Mrs. Williams made her appearance.  Anger
was upon her face, and it required but a small amount of penetration to
perceive that she came fully charged with all sorts of reproaches.  Helen
trembled and shrunk back for she had an habitual fear of her mother, which 
the
imperious conduct of that individual had induced in the mind of so gentle a
creature as Helen from her very childhood.

     "Well, madam," said Henry, stepping forward; "to what are we indebted 
for
the honour of this visit from one who has not the courtesy to wait for an
invitation?"

     "Oh! I expected this," said Mrs. Williams, with a shivering toss of her
head; "I quite expected this, I can assure you-- of course.  But I'll pretty
soon let you know, sir, what I came about.  I have come for my daughter, 
sir.
What have you got to say against that?"

     "Nothing, madam; if your daughter chooses to comply with your request."

     "Helen!" screamed Mrs. Williams.  "Helen! I command you to come home 
this
moment!"

     "Mother, hear me!" said Helen.  "Consent to my happiness with one whom 
I
can love, with the same readiness that you would have seen me the bride of 
one
for whom I never could hope to feel anything in the shape of affection, and 
I
will accompany you home at once."

     "Oh, dear, yes-- of course.  Consent to ruin-- consent to nonsense!
Consent to your marrying a scapegrace who cannot even keep himself-- far 
less
a wife!  No, Helen; you cannot expect that I should ever consent to your
marrying such a poor wretch."

     "But don't you think," said Henry, "that any poor wretch is better than 
a
vampyre?"

     "No; I do not."

     "Oh! very good, then," said the admiral; "if that's the lady's opinion,
what can we say to her?  And, as for commanding Miss Helen, here, to go 
home,
I command her to stay."

     "You command her?"

     "Yes, to be sure.  Ain't I an admiral?  What have you got to say 
against
that, I should like to know?  I shall take good care that James Anderson is 
no
poor wretch by getting him some good appointment; and, as your daughter is 
of
age, old girl, and so can choose for herself, you may as well weigh anchor,
and be off at once, for nobody wants to be bothered with you."

     "Do you mean to say you are a real admiral, and have nothing to do with
the horse-marines?"

     "Nothing whatever, ma'am.  Good day to you-- we are all waiting for our
dinners, and don't feel disposed to talk any more; so be off with you."

     Mrs. Williams seemed to be considering for a moment, and then she said,
--

     "Oh, gracious! a mother's feelings must always be excused.  I almost
think that-- just to please you, admiral-- I will consent."

     "You will, mother?" exclaimed Helen.

     "Why, in a manner of speaking," said Mrs. Williams, "I should not mind;
but it's quite, you see, a dreadful thing to think of, when we consider what
an expense I have gone to in all these matters, and that I have not had so
much as one farthing from the baron, although he did say he would pay all 
the
cost I might be put to."

     "From resources which, in course of time, industry may procure me," 
said
James Anderson, eagerly, "you shall be repaid all that you can possibly say
has been expended for Helen."

     "Ah! well, then, if Admiral Bell, here, will say that he will see me
paid, I consent."

     "Very well," said the admiral; "I'll see you paid.  If you had acted
generously in the matter, you should have been a gainer; but, as it is, you
shall be paid, and we decline your acquaintance."

     Mrs. Williams began, from the tone and manner of her daughter's new
friends, to suspect that it would have been more prudent on her part if she
had behaved in a very different manner towards them, and complied with a 
good
grace with their wishes; for, as regarded the baron, anything in the shape 
of
a more extended connexion with him was clearly out of the question.

     But she had gone almost too far for reconciliation, and, although there
was no such thing as denying the genius of the lady, she was, for a few
minutes, puzzled to know what to do.  At length, however, she thought it 
would
not be a bad plan to be suddenly quite overcome with her feelings, and make 
a
desperate scene.

     Accordingly, to the surprise of every one, and the consternation of the
admiral, she suddenly uttered a piercing scream, and commenced a good
exhibition of hysterics.

     "D--n it!" cried the admiral; "what does she mean by that? Come, come, 
I
say, Mother Williams, we cannot stand all that noise, you know; it is quite
out of the question!"

     "Let us all leave the room," said Henry, "and send Jack Pringle to her.
I have heard him say that he has some mode of recovering ladies from 
hysterics
by throwing a pail-full of salt water over them, and then biting their
thumb-nails off."

     "The wretch!" exclaimed Mrs. Williams, suddenly recovering.  "The 
wretch!
I'd let him know soon enough what it was to interfere with my nails!"

     "Oh! you are better, are you?" said the admiral.

     "What's that to you?" shrieked Mrs. Williams.  "I'll go at once to a
lawyer, and see what can be done with you.  I look upon you all with odium 
and
contempt!"

     "Ah! words easily spoken," said the admiral; "and just like young
chickens they commonly go home to roost."

     Mrs. Williams darted an angry look at the whole party, which she 
intended
should be expressive at once of the immense contempt in which she held them,
and of her determination to have vengeance upon their heads, which
double-dealing look, however, had no effect upon them of an intimidating
character, and then she bounced from the room.

     "My dear," said the admiral, turning to Helen, who he saw was affected 
at
the proceeding.  "My dear, don't you fret yourself.  Your mother cannot make
us angry; and, as far as regards her own anger, it will all subside, and 
then
we will forget that she has said anything at all uncivil to us.  So don't 
you
fret yourself about what is of no consequence at all."

     "You may depend," said Henry, "that such will be the fact, and that in 
a
very short time you will find that your mother has completely recovered from
her anger, and will be as pleasant with us all as possible.  I grieve to say
so to you, but the fact is, what you must perceive, namely, that, as regards
your mother, your marriage is merely a matter of pounds, shillings, and 
pence,
and when she finds that the baron's fortune cannot be had, she will content
herself with reflecting upon the prospects of Mr. James Anderson, who, if he
do well, will soon be quite a favourite."

     It was humiliating to poor Helen to be forced to confess that this was
the correct view to take of the question, but she could not help doing so at
all: and, after a time, she did not regret having sufficient moral courage 
to
resist the command of her mother to return home.

     In the society of him whom she loved, and upheld and encouraged, too, 
as
she was by Flora, who was just about the best and kindest companion such a
person as Helen could have had, the minutes began to fly past upon rosy
pinions, and the remainder of that day she confessed, even to the admiral, 
was
the happiest she had known for many a weary month.

     The Bannerworths and James Anderson fully expected another visit from
Mrs. Williams on the morrow, but she did not come; and, although they had
expected her to do so, her not coming was no disappointment, but, on the
contrary, a matter for some congratulation.

     But no time was lost; and, as James Anderson was really most anxious to
get to London to report himself at the Admiralty, and as that was an anxiety
in which the admiral much encouraged him, so that as it was quite an
understood thing among them all that the marriage of the fair Helen should
take place before he again left her, a special license was procured, and the
ceremony arranged to take place at nine o'clock in the morning, on the 
second
morning after the strange and exciting occurrences at Anderbury House.

     This marriage was conducted in the most private manner possible; 
because,
as it had been so well known throughout the whole of Anderbury that Helen
Williams was the chosen of the great and rich Baron Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh,
who had tuned out to be such an equivocal character, the news of her 
marriage
with any one else would have been sure to have created a vast amount of 
pubic
curiosity.

     All this they escaped by fixing the hour at which the ceremony was to 
be
performed at an early hour in the morning, and trusting no one out of their
own party with the secret.

     Of course, from what the reader knows of the gentle and timid 
disposition
of Helen Williams, he may well suppose how glad she would have been to have
had the countenance of her mother at her marriage, notwithstanding the 
conduct
of that mother was certainly not what should have entitled her to the esteem
of any one whatever, not excepting her own child.

     But this was a feeling which, when she came to consider the new tie she
was forming, was likely soon to wear away; and, although, while she 
pronounced
those words which were irrevocably to make her another's, the tears gushed 
to
her eyes, they were far different from those bitter drops she had shed when
she considered that, beyond all hope of redemption, she was condemned to
become the bride of the baron.

     When the ceremony was over, they all went back very quietly and
comfortably to the inn, and, after a good breakfast, and many healths had 
been
drank to the bride, James Anderson, according to arrangement, took his
departure for London, leaving Helen in the care of the Bannerworths until he
should come back to claim her, as he now could do, despite all the plots and
machinations of Mrs. Williams, who, as yet, was in a state of blessed
ignorance as to the fact of her daughter's wedding, and who had not quite 
made
up her mind as to what she should do next in so delicate and troublesome a
transaction.

 NEXT TIME:  Mrs. Williams Takes the Initiative, and Nearly Catches an
 Admiral.



                               CHAPTER CXXIII.

MRS. WILLIAMS TAKES THE INITIATIVE, AND NEARLY CATCHES AN ADMIRAL.


     Mrs. Williams, when she reached home after what must be called her very
unsuccessful attempt to make a disturbance, and to do the grand at the inn
where the Bannerworths were, set herself seriously to think what would be 
the
best course for her to adopt in the rather perplexing aspect of her affairs.

     The few words she had used at the inn, indicative of her censure of all
the proceedings, had been of rather a strong and energetic character, so 
that
she had a very uncomfortable suspicion upon her mind that she would find it
rather a difficult task to pacify her daughter's new friends.

     The offer which the admiral had made to repay to her any expense she 
had
been at, impressed her with a belief that he surely must be in possession of
what, to her, was the most delightful thing in the world, and comprehended 
all
sorts of virtue, namely, money; and of course her feelings became instantly
most wonderfully ameliorated.

     "I'm very much afraid I have been too precipitate," she said.  "I 
really
am afraid I have, and that ain't a pleasant reflection by any means. What 
can
I do to get good friends with them all, and particularly the dear old
gentleman who promised to pay me?"

     This was the problem which Mrs. Williams presented to her mind, for the
captivating idea of actually having been paid 500 [pounds] by the baron, and
thus sending in a bill of the same amount to the admiral, took wonderful and
complete possession of her.

     This was, indeed, she considered, a masterstroke of policy, and all she
had now to consider was, the means of getting on such good terms with the
admiral that he should neither question items nor amount of the account she
intended to send him in.

     "If he only pays the 500 [pounds] as well as the baron has paid his, I
shall not come out of the transaction so badly," said Mrs. Williams.

     While she was in this state of perplexity, she was sitting by the 
window
of her dining-room, which commanded a view of the street, and, as she sat
there, she was much surprised to see Jack Pringle, who she still had a
lingering suspicion might, notwithstanding his disclaimer of the title, be
Admiral Green, on the other side of the way, making various significant
movements of his hands and head, as if he had something of an exceedingly
secret and strange mysterious nature to communicate to her, Mrs. Williams.

     This was quite sufficient to call for that lady's most serious 
attention,
and accordingly she walked graciously so close to the window that her
aristocratic nose touched the glass, and nodded to Jack, after which she
beckoned him across the way, after the manner of the ghost in Hamlet, upon
which Jack, with a nod, came across the way forthwith.

     In another moment Mrs. Williams opened the street-door herself, and 
said,
--

     "Mr. What's-your-name, have you got anything to say to me?"

     "Rather," said Jack.

     "What is it, then-- pray what is it, Mr. What's-your-name?"

     "Don't call me What's-your-name, ma'am, any longer; my name is Jack
Pringle."

     "Mr. John Pringle, I suppose?"

     "No such thing; nothing but plain Jack, ma'am; so you see you are
mistaken.  But I have got something to say to you, ma'am, as you ought to
know."

     Any one who had known Jack would have seen, by a certain mischievous
twinkling of the eyes, that he had on hand what he considered one of the 
most
excellent of jokes in all the world, and was about to perpetrate what he
thought some famous piece of jollity.  What it was, we shall quickly 
perceive,
from his communication with Mrs. Williams.

     "Well, ma'am," he added, "you know Admiral Bell, I believe?"'

     "Oh, yes-- yes; certainly, I do."

     "Well, I don't know as I ought to tell you, Mrs. W., what I'm going to
tell you; but, first of all, the old admiral, what with prize money, pay, 
and
one thing and another, is so immensely rich, that he really don't know what 
to
do with his money."

     "How dreadful!" said Mrs. Williams; "I think I could really suggest to
him some few things to do."

     "Oh, he is so desperately obstinate, he will listen to nobody; and, you
see, as he never married, who as he got to leave it to?  At least that's 
what
we have been all wondering, for I don't know how long; but now what do you
think we have found out, Mrs. Williams?"

     "Well, that's very difficult, of course, for me to say.  Perhaps you 
will
be so good as to tell me."

     "You ought to know.  He has fallen in love, ma'am-- actually in love, 
for
the first time in his life.  Yes, he has actually fallen in love, Mrs.
Williams; there's a go."

     "And with one of my daughters!  It's with Julia-- I did mention her to
him, and I thought I saw a curious expression come across his face.   Of
course, I'm quite delighted to hear it; for, with the feelings of a mother, 
I
like to get my girls off hand as well as I can; and, as Admiral Bell is so
very respectable a person, I can have no sort of objection in the world."

     "There you go, again," said Jack; "you are quite mistaken, I can tell
you.  You never made a greater blunder than that in all your life, Mother
Williams-- excuse me, ma'am, but that's my way."

     "Oh, don't mention it-- but where's the mistake, my dear sir?"

     "Why, just here, ma'am-- just here.  The admiral is not so young as he
was twenty-five years ago, and he ain't quite such a fool as to think that a
young girl can care anything for him.  But he is in love, for all that.  
Only
you see, ma'am, it happens to be with somebody else."

     "Good gracious!  Who is it? -- and why do you come to me about it?"

     "Because it's you."

     "Me! me! oh, gracious Providence, you don't mean that!  In love with 
me! 
The rich old admiral-- he cannot live long.  How much money, take it
altogether, do you really think he has got?  I declare you have taken me so 
by
surprise, that I don't know what I am saying.  Of course he will propose a
very handsome settlement."

     "You may depend upon all that," said Jack; "but the odd thing is, you
see, ma'am, that although he is quite over head and ears in love, he won't 
own
it, but walks about like a bear with a bad place on his back, doing nothing
but growl, growl, from morning till night."

     "Then how can you tell," said Mrs. Williams, "if he never said so?"

     "Oh, he does say so.  He mumbles it out to himself, and we have heard 
him
say, --

     " 'Damn it all! that Mrs. Williams is the craft for my money; but 
what's
the use of me bothering her about it? -- she wouldn't have an old hulk like
me, so I won't say anything about it to anybody.' "

     "What an amiable idea!"

     "Very, ma'am, very; and what I have come to you for now is to say, that
if you have no objection to the match, you might as well make the old man
happy, by letting him know, in some sort of way, that you wouldn't be so
hard-hearted as he thinks, but would have him if he would say the word."

     "How can I express how much obliged I am to you, Mr. Wingle!"

     "Pringle, if you please, ma'am, is my name; and as to being obliged to
me, you ain't at all, and I'll tell you how: you see, I and the admiral have
sailed with each other many a voyage, and I have a sort of feeling for the 
old
man that makes me, when I see that he has a fancy, try my best to gratify
him; and, without thinking of anybody but him, I've come to you just to tell
you what I know about the affair, and I must leave it to you to do what you
like."

     "Still I am very much obliged to you.  What if I were to call and ask 
for
a private interview with the old man?"

     "A good idea," said Jack.  "It was only the other day I heard him say 
you
was his pearl, and the main chain of his heart, I can tell you, and ever 
such
a load more.  He will be taking his dinner at four to-day, and after that he
usually takes a sleep in an arm chair, in a room by himself, and if you like
to come then, you will catch him."

     "Be assured, my dear sir, I shall be there punctually to the minute. 
You
will be so good as to receive me, and introduce me to him, and, perhaps, it
would remove some of his timidity if I were to let him know that I was aware
that he had called me his pearl, and the main chain of his heart."

     "Of course it would," said Jack.  "You put him in mind of it, ma'am, 
and
if you find him back'erd a little, don't you mind about giving him a little
encouragement, because you know all the while he really means it, so you 
need
not care about it."

     "Well, Mr.--a--a--Bingle, all I can say is, that I feel very much 
obliged
to you indeed, for letting me know this matter; and my great respect for you
and for the old admiral will, I assure you, induce me to consent to what you
propose. -- A-hem! of course I have many offers, as you may well suppose, 
Mr.
Cringle."

     "Damn it," said Jack, "I've told you before that my name is Pringle, 
and
if you can't recollect that, just call me Jack, and have done with it-- you
won't forget Jack, I'll be bound.  Call me that, and I sha'n't quarrel with
you about it, ma'am; but don't be inventing all sorts of odd names for me."

     "Pray excuse me, my dear sir, I certainly will do no such thing; and at
three o'clock, I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing you.  I believe 
it's
the Red Lion where you are staying?"

     "Yes, the Red Lion Inn; and at three I shall be on the look out for 
you,
ma'am, you may depend; and I only hope you won't mistake the admiral's
bashfulness for anything else, because, I assure you, he is mad in love with
you, but don't like to own it, ma'am; so just you bring him out a little, 
and
don't you mind what he says."

     Mrs. Williams duly promised she would not mind what the old man said,
and, from what we know of that lady, we are quite inclined, for once in a 
way,
to give her credit for sincerity in that matter, and the greatest possible
amount of candour.

     As for Jack, when he left her house, and had got fairly round the 
corner
and out of sight, he laughed to that excess that several passers-by stopped 
to
look at him in wonder, and had he not ceased, he certainly would have had a
crowd round him in a very few minutes longer, that would have perhaps 
thought
him out of his senses.

     But after a few minutes, the explosion of his bottled-up mirth had
subsided, and after giving a boy, who was the nearest to him of the admiring
spectators, a good rap on the head, he walked to the inn.

     Jack would have been glad to have told some one of the capital joke he
was playing off at the admiral's expense, but he was afraid of being 
betrayed;
so he wisely kept the secret of the forthcoming jest all to himself; 
although
Henry Bannerworth and Charles Holland might both, after such a thing 
happened,
or even during its progress, have a good laugh at it, it is not to be
supposed, entertaining as they did so great a respect for the old admiral,
that they would have lent themselves to the perpetration of such a joke.

     As may be supposed, Mrs. Williams was all flutter and expectation, and
the idea of at length mending her decayed fortune by an union with the old
man, who was reported to be immensely rich, and who had already reached an 
age
when his life could not be depended upon one week from another, was one of 
the
most gratifying circumstances on record to her.

     No possible plan could have been devised which was so likely to chime 
in
with her humour as this, and if she had been asked in which way she would 
like
to make money, it would have been that which she would have undoubtedly
chosen.

     "Now," she thought, "I shall, after all, make an admirable thing of 
this
affair, there can be no doubt.  I shall, of course, soon be a widow again, 
for
the old sea monster cannot live long. I shall insist upon a very liberal
settlement indeed, and then I suppose, while he does live, I must keep him 
in
a good humour, so that he may leave me, at all events, the bulk of his
property when he dies, and then I can live in the style I like, and make
everybody die of envy."

     To excite an extraordinary amount of envy was the very height of 
felicity
to Mrs. Williams, as, indeed, it is to many people of far greater 
pretensions
than that lady; and we cannot help thinking, when we see gaudy equipages and
all the glittering and costly paraphernalia of _parvenu_ wealth, that the
great object of it is to excite envy far more than admiration and pleasure.

     "There are the Narrowidges, and the Staples, and the Jenkinses," 
thought
Mrs. Williams.  "Oh! I know they will all be ready to eat their very heads
off, when they hear that I am married, and that, too, so well.  Oh! they 
will
die of spite, and particularly Mrs. Jenkins.  I am quite sure she will have 
a
serious illness."

     These were the kind of triumphs upon which Mrs. Williams felicitated
herself, and pictured to her imagination as the result of her marriage with
the admiral, which she now looked upon as quite a settled thing; because, if
he were willing, she felt perfectly sure that she was; and, therefore, what
was to prevent the union from taking place?

     What pleasant anticipations these were!  Really, we can almost consider
them, while they lasted, as sufficient to counterbalance any disappointment
which was likely afterwards to take place; and the hour or two which Mrs.
Williams devoted to the gorgeous dream of wealth she so fully expected to
enjoy, were probably the most delightful she had ever passed.  And certainly
so far she had to thank Jack Pringle for giving her so much satisfaction,
although, as will be seen, she did not feel towards him any great amount of
gratitude on the momentous occasion.

     Mrs. Williams, no doubt, still thought herself quite a fascinating 
woman;
and when she had failed in guessing that it was to herself that the admiral
was, according to Jack's account, devoted, it was not that she entertained a
modest and quiet opinion of her own attractions, but from the force of 
habit,
seeing that so long a period had elapsed without her having an admirer, that
she could not believe she had one then, until actually assured in plain
language of the fact.

     And now, about half an hour before the appointed time, the lady arrayed
herself in what she considered an extremely becoming and fashionable 
costume,
and started to keep her appointment with Jack Pringle, who, in her 
affections,
now held quite a pleasant place, and towards whom she considered herself so
much indebted for the kind information she had received at his hands.

     The distance from any house in Anderbury to any other, was but short, 
so
that Mrs. Williams was within the time mentioned, when she reached the door 
of
the Red Lion; but she was gratified to find that Jack Pringle was there,
apparently on the look out for her, because it showed that nothing had
happened to alter the aspect of affairs, but that the chances of her 
becoming
Mrs. Admiral Bell were as strong as ever.

     "I'm glad you have come," said Jack.  "They got over their dinner 
rather
quick, and that's a fact; and the old man is fast asleep as usual, so you 
can
commence operations at once."

     "A thousand thanks-- a thousand thanks, my good friend, and you may
depend upon my gratitude."

     "Hush! never mind that," said Jack; "I don't want nothing.  This way--
this way, ma'am, if you please."

 Next Time: The Admiral in a Breeze. -- A General Commotion, and Jack 
Pringle
 Much Wanted, but Not to be Found.




                               CHAPTER CXXVI.

THE ADMIRAL IN A BREEZE. -- A GENERAL COMMOTION, AND JACK PRINGLE MUCH 
WANTED,
BUT NOT TO BE FOUND.


     To say that Mrs. Williams was on the tiptoe of expectation, is to say
very little that can convey a good idea of what was her real condition,
nervously speaking, as she followed Jack Pringle up, not the principal, but 
a
back staircase of the inn, toward the room where the admiral took his nap,
which was

     "His custom always of an afternoon."

The fact is, that Jack had a great dread of Mrs. Williams being seen by any 
of
the Bannerworth family, because they all knew her; and the nice little plot 
he
had got up for the purpose of holding out the admiral to ridicule, while at
the same time he enjoyed the immense satisfaction of having some revenge 
upon
Mrs. Williams.

     Hence was it, that, like many a great politician, he went up the back
staircase instead of the front, in order to avoid unnecessary observation 
and
remark.

     By good fortune, as well as good management, Jack met nobody, but
succeeded in reaching the room door, within which the admiral was sleeping, 
in
perfect safety.

     "Now, ma'am," said Jack, "don't you be backerd in going forerd, cos, as 
I
tell you, the old man is dying by inches for you, and I don't see why you
shouldn't have his half a million of money, as well as anybody else.  Ah! 
and
a good deal better, too, when one comes to consider all things."

     "Thank you, Mr. Pringle, thank you.  I really don't know how to express
my obligations to you, upon my word.  You are so very kind and considerate 
in
all you say."

     "Oh! don't mention it, ma'am.  Walk in, and there you will find the old
baby.  I shouldn't wonder but he's disturbing his old brains by dreaming of
you now."

     Jack opened the door, and Mrs. Williams glided noiselessly into an
apartment, where, seated, sure enough, in an easy chair, with a silk
handkerchief over his face, sat the admiral, fast asleep, enjoying that
comfortable siesta, which he never for one moment imagined would be 
disturbed
in the manner it was about to be.

     "Well," said Mrs. Williams, "there he is, to be sure, just as Jack
Pringle said, -- asleep, and no doubt dreaming of me.  I must make sure of 
the
old fool in one interview, or he may slip through my fingers, and that would
not be at all pleasant after counting upon him, and taking some trouble in 
the
matter."

     But although she made up her mind that nothing should be wanting, upon
her part, to make sure of him, yet she debated whether she ought to awaken 
him
or not; for she well knew that many old people, especially men, were very
irascible if they are awakened suddenly, and from what she had already seen 
of
the admiral, she could very well imagine that such might be the case with 
him.

     This was getting rather a quondary, out of which Mrs. Williams did not
exactly see her way; and yet the proposition that the admiral was to be, and
must be, awakened in some way, remained as firmly as ever fixed in her mind. 
And then, too, the idea -- a very natural one under the circumstances -- 
came
across her that each minute was fraught with danger, and that, for all she
knew, the yea or nay of the whole affair might depend upon the promptitude
with which it was concluded.

     What, if, she asked herself, some of the odious Bannerworth people were
to come in and find her there -- of course they would awaken the admiral at
once, and in consequence of their presence, she would lose all opportunity 
of
exercising those little blandishments which she meant to bring to bear upon
him.

     This was positively alarming.  The idea of all being lost, prompted her
at all events to attempt something; so Mrs. Williams thought that the 
mildest
way of awakening the admiral was by a loud sneeze, which she executed 
without
producing the least effect, as might have been expected; for the man who had
many a time slept soundly in the wildest fury of the elements, was not 
likely
to awaken because somebody sneezed.

     "Dear me, how sound he sleeps.  A-- hem! -- hem!  A--_chew!_ -- a-- a--
hem! -- A _chewaway!_"

     The admiral was proof against all this, and Mrs. Williams might just as
well have spared herself the trouble of exciting such an amount of 
artificial
sneezes, for the admiral slept on, and it was quite clear that something 
much
more sonorous would be required for the purpose of awaking him.

     "How vexatious," she thought; "how very vexatious.  But there's no help
for it.  Awakened he must be, that's quite clear; and if fair means won't do
it, why, foul must."

     Acting upon this resolve, Mrs. Williams hesitated no longer, but,
approaching the sleeping admiral, she dragged the handkerchief off his face,
and its passage over his nose, no doubt, produced the tickling sensation 
that
induced him to give that organ a very hard rub, indeed, and start wide awake
with an exclamation that was much more forcible than elegant, and that
consequently we need not transfer to our pages at all.

     "Oh! admiral," said Mrs. Williams, assuming a look that ought at once 
to
have melted a heart of stone; "oh! admiral, can you, indeed, forgive me?"

     "The devil!" said the admiral.

     "Can you, indeed, look over the fact, that in my anxiety to see that
face, I took from before it the envious, and yet fortunate handkerchief that
covered it?  It was my act, and upon my head fall all the censure, my dear,
good, kind admiral."

     The old man rubbed his eyes very hard with his knuckles, as he said, --

     "I suppose I'm awake."

     "You are awake, my dear sir.  It is, indeed, no dream, let me assure 
you,
that disturbs you, but a living reality.  You are awake, my dear sir."

     "Why-- why, what do you mean?  I begin to think I am awake, with a
vengeance; but who are you?  Hang me if I don't think you are old Mother
Williams!"

     "Oh! my dear admiral, you are so facetious-- so very facetious; but can
you for one moment fancy, my dear sir, that I am insensible to your merit? 
Can you fancy that I could look with other than indulgent eyes upon a Bell?"

     "Upon a what?"

     "A Bell-- an Admiral Bell.  Indeed, I may say-- with a slight but
pardonable alteration of a word-- an admirable Bell.  My dear sir, your 
pearl
speaks to you."

     The admiral was so amazed at this address, accompanied as it was by 
most
languishing looks, that, with his mouth wide open, and his eyes
preternaturally distended, he gazed upon Mrs. Williams without saying a 
word;
from which she inferred that he was beginning to see that she was aware of 
his
attachment to her, and was thinking of how he could best express his 
gratitude
for her taking the initiative in the matter.

     Thus encouraged, then, she spoke again, saying, as she advanced close 
to
him, --

     "Oh, my dear sir, what a thing the human heart is.  Only to think now,
that from the first moment I saw you, I should whisper to myself-- there--
yes, there is the only human being for whose sake I could again enter into
that holy state from which the death of Mr. Williams released me."

     "Why, good God!" said the admiral, "the woman's mad!"

     "Oh! no-- no.  The world-- the horrid, low, work-a-day world, may make
invidious remarks about us, but your pearl will recompense you for all that,
and in the sweet concord of domestic life, we shall never sigh for more than
we shall have, which will be, of course, if I understand rightly, a large
income-- I don't know how much a year, and if I ask, it is only out of
curiosity, my dear sir, and nothing else.  Love-- absolute and beautiful 
love,
is all I ask."

     "Hilloa!" roared the admiral; "Charles!  Henry!  Jack!  Where the devil
are you all?  D--n it, you are all ready enough when I don't want you; but
now, when I am going to be boarded by a mad woman, you can't come one of 
you. 
Hilloa! help! Charles! Jack, you lubber, where the deuce have you taken
yourself to, and why don't you tumble up when you are sent for?"

     "But, my dear sir, why need you trouble yourself to call so many
witnesses to our happiness?  Let us be privately married in some rural
church."

     "Privately d--d first, I'd be," said the old admiral.

     "Oh, then, it shall be a public alliance, if you wish it," exclaimed 
Mrs.
Williams, as she made up her mind to clinch the affair at once by a _coup de
main;_ and advancing to the admiral, she flung her arms around his neck just
as a door at the other end of the apartment opened, and Charles and Henry,
with Flora, made their appearance, and looked with the most intense
astonishment at the scene before them.

     "Well, uncle," said Charles, "I certainly should not have expected this
of you.  I am astonished, I must confess."

     "Nor I," said Henry; "why, admiral, I had no idea you were so dangerous 
a
personage."

     Mrs. Williams, when she saw what arrivals had taken place, gave a faint
scream, and released the admiral, and then she added, --

     "Oh, admiral, how could you hold me so when you hear somebody coming?
How shall I ever survive such a scene as this?  My character will be gone 
for
ever, unless I am immediately married to you, and I have no doubt but that 
all
your friends will at once see the propriety of such a step."

     "I do," said Charles.

     "And I," said Henry.

     "And I," of course, said Flora.

     Mrs. Williams burst into tears when she saw this unanimity of opinion;
but the admiral's face got the colour of a piece of beet-root, and he was 
only
silent for a moment or two, while he was made the subject of these cruel
remarks, until he could sufficiently recover to speak with the energy that 
did
characterise him when he really began.

     We are not exactly in the vein to transfer to our pages the violent
expletives with which he garnished his outburst of passion, and our readers,
if they recall to their minds a large amount of nautical oaths, can have no
difficulty in supposing that the admiral uttered every one of them with a
volubility that was perfectly alarming.

     "D--n it! do you mean to kill me, all of you, or to drive me mad?  
(Five
oaths in a string came in here.)  Do you want to cut me up, you---?  (Three
horrible epithets.)  What do you mean by setting this old woman upon me? 
Whose precious idea was this, I should like to know, to put an elderly she-
dragon upon me, whom I hate and be--- (ten oaths at least) when I was
enjoying a comfortable nap?"

     "Hate!" exclaimed Mrs. Williams; "did you say hate, you old seducing
villain! when you knew you said I was your pearl, you hoary-headed ruffian!"

     "That's a thundering crammer," cried the admiral; "you said it 
yourself;
and as for hating you, d--n it, if I don't do that with all my heart."

     "And is this the way I'm to be treated before people?  Oh! you wicked 
old
sinner, I understand you now.  Your intentions were not honourable, and now
you find that my virtue is proof against your horrid old fascinations, you
want to pretend that it's all a mistake."

     "Really," said Charles, "we must confess, uncle, that we found Mrs.
Williams and you-- ahem! -- rather loving, you know; and the gentleman on
these occasions is usually asked to account for such things, I take it."

     "Of course," said Mrs. Williams; "I'll bring an action against the
admiral, and I shall call upon you all to be witnesses for me.  Oh! you old
sinner, I'll make you pay for this!"

     "We certainly can all be witnesses," said Flora, "that the admiral 
called
for help; and when we came we found Mrs. Williams holding him fast round the
neck, to which he seemed to have the greatest possible repugnance."

     "That's right! hurrah!  That's the truth, Flora, my dear.  That's just
how it was.  This horrid old woman come all of a sudden and laid hold of me
after awakening me, and then I called for help.  That's how it was."

     "But these gentlemen," said Mrs. Williams, appealing to Henry and
Charles, "will swear quite different."

     "Oh, I beg your pardon, Mrs. Williams," said Charles; "if we are 
brought
forward to swear anything, we must be correct; and, therefore, we shall have
to say just what this lady has stated; and perhaps your best plan will be to
go away and say no more about it; but consider that you have made a 
mistake."

     "A mistake!" screamed Mrs. Williams; "how could I make a mistake, when
Mr. John Pringle, who knows the admiral so well, told me that he was dying 
to
see me, and in love with me to never such an extent, only that he was afraid 
I
would not have anything to say to him on such a subject."

     The admiral drew a long breath and sat down.  Then, clenching his hand,
he shook it above his head, saying, in a voice of deep and concentrated 
anger, 
--

     "I thought as much.  D--n it, if I did not.  It's all that infernal
scoundrel Jack Pringle's doings, I find.  It's one of that lubberly, 
mutinous
thief's tricks, and it's the last one he shall ever play me."

     "A trick!" screamed Mrs. Williams; "a trick!  You don't mean that!  Ah,
me! what compensation shall I get for the dreadful circumstance which has 
made
me confess the secret of my heart! What shall I do-- oh, what shall I do? 
When shall I hope for consolation!  What sum of money, even if you, my dear
admiral, were to offer it to me, would be a sufficient balm now to my 
wounded
heart?"

     "Madam," said Henry, "it seems that you have been imposed upon, and 
made
the victim of a practical joke, which we nor the admiral can have nothing to
do with; and the only consolation we can offer to your wounded heart, is, 
that
we will keep the secret of your attachment most inviolate."

     "What compensation is that to me?  I'll bring my action for breach of
promise of marriage, if I don't get something, and that something very
handsome too.  It's all very fine to talk to me about your mistakes; I'll be
paid-- ah, and paid well, too, or I'll make the whole country ring again 
with
the matter."

     "Madam," said Charles, "I dare say the admiral don't care one straw
whether the country rings again or not, and you can do just as you please; 
but
since you have commenced threatening, you will, I hope, see the obvious
propriety of at once leaving his place."

     "I will leave this place, but it shall be to go direct to my solicitor,
and see what he will say to a lone woman being treated in this way.  I'll
swear that he called me his pearl-- and if that don't get me a verdict and
most exemplary damages, I don't know what will.  We shall see what we shall
see, and, in the meantime, you wretches, I leave you all to contempt.  Yes,
contempt."

     "Stop a bit, ma'am," said the admiral.  "It's quite plain to me that 
you
don't mind how you earn a trifle, so that you do get it; and now I'll tell
you, that if you find out that rascal, Jack Pringle, and give him a good
trouncing for his share in the business, you may come to me for a reward."

     Mrs. Williams, whatever might have been her personal feelings on this
head, did not deign to make the least reply to this intimation, but suddenly
cried--

     "I want to see my daughter."

     "She is not here at present," said Flora; "and, if she were, she is 
Mrs.
Anderson now, and therefore would of course decline accompanying you to your
home-- and she is only waiting some arrangements of her husband's, prior,
most probably, to going to London with him."

     This speech brought to the recollection of Mrs. Williams, that the
admiral had promised her all the expenses that she had been at contingent 
upon
the broken-off marriage of her daughter with the baron, and she began to
consider that her action for breach of promise of marriage against him might
fail, and that, if it succeeded, it might not bring in half so much as the
amount of the bill she could by fair means get out of him.

     These considerations were of great pith and amount, and they had their
full effect upon Mrs. Williams; so, instead of bursting out with any further
reproaches, she sat down and commenced a softening process by a copious 
flood
of tears which she had always at command.

     "Oh," said the old admiral, "you may well cry over it, old girl.  I
suppose you really thought you had hooked the old man at last, eh?  But 
never
do you mind, you may make a good thing of it yet, if you get hold of that
scoundrel, Pringle, and serve him out well.  I'll pay for that job more
willingly than for anything else I know of just at present."

     "Don't speak to me of that brute, my dear sir," sobbed Mrs. Williams.
"It's a very cruel thing, of course, to be used in this way, and, as it's 
all
a mistake on my part, I hope you will excuse and look over what has 
happened. 
I am sure I should be the last person in the world to trouble anybody with
visits who did not want to see me; and so, I dare say, we shall only meet 
once
again in this world."

     "Once again, madam!  What is the use of our ever meeting again?"

     "It would look decidedly disrespectful on my part, if I were not to 
hand
you the bill myself for the little matters that you were kind enough to say
you would pay for on account of what I had expended on Helen's projected
marriage with the vampyre baron, you know, admiral."

     "Oh, ah! I recollect now.  Well, well; I don't want to go back from my
word, and as I did promise you, why, I will pay you; but as I don't want, on
any account, the pleasure of your company again, you will be so kind, ma'am,
as to take this twenty-pounds note, and keep the change."

     This the admiral thought liberal enough; for his idea of matrimonial
preparations consisted of a new dress or two, or so, and which twenty pounds
ought fairly enough to cover; and he thought he would do well enough by
overpaying Mrs. Williams, as he believed, with that amount.

     When Mrs. Williams recovered from her surprise, not unmingled with
indignation, into which this most audacious and, to her, extraordinary offer
threw her, she spoke with a kind of scream, that made the old admiral jump
again, as she shouted in his ears, --

     "What! twenty pounds?  Are you in your senses?  Twenty pounds!  Why, my
bill will be, at least, five hundred pounds."

     "What?" roared the admiral.  "Are you in your senses?  D--n it, ma'am!
you may swallow your bill; and you had better do so, for all the good it is
likely to do you; for, if I pay a farthing more, may I be hung up at my own
yard-arm.  Why, you must think that a British admiral is another name for a
fool."

     "Then I tell you what," said Mrs. Williams -- "I tell you what, you
stupid, old, atrocious sinner-- I tell you, I will bring my action against
you for breach of promise of marriage; and I'll swear that, before your gang
of people here came in-- who, of course, will swear black is white, and 
white
is crimson for you, because, I believe, you are the father of them all-- 
that
you first asked me to live with you, and when I refused, you said you would
marry me by special licence to-morrow."

     "Madam," said Charles, "now that you think proper entirely to forget 
that
you are a lady, allow me to beg of you to retire; because it is quite
impossible, after what has happened, that I should hold any further
conversation with you."

     "Yes, Mrs. Williams," said Henry, "I hope you will perceive the 
propriety
of at once leaving."

     At this moment a note was handed to Henry, who, upon opening it, read
aloud, --

     "The Baron Stolmuyer, of Salzburgh, presents his compliments to Mr.
Bannerworth, and begs to state that Mrs. Williams has received from him the
sum of five hundred pounds for expenses to be incurred on account of the
wedding of her daughter; and he hereby fully empowers Mr. Bannerworth to
demand of Mrs. Williams that sum, and to devote it to the service and uses 
of
Mr. James Anderson, of whose existence the baron was not aware when he made
his proposal to Mrs. Williams for her daughter, whom she sold to him, the
baron, for that sum."

     "Hilloa!" cried the admiral; "what do you think of that, Mrs. Williams?
I don't know what you will say to it; but I know very well that I should
consider it a shot between wind and water."

     "I trust," said Henry, "that you will now still further see the 
propriety
of leaving here, and of letting this matter completely rest; because it
strikes me that the more you investigate it, madam, the more it will turn 
out
greatly to your disadvantage."

     "I don't care a pin's head for any of you, nor half a farthing," cried
Mrs. Williams.  "The baron gave me the money, and he has no power to get it
back again, as you know well enough.  I'll bring my action, and my principal
witness shall be Mr. Pringle, who came to my house, and who, if put upon his
oath, will be obliged to swear---"

     "That it was all a lark," said Jack, popping his head just within the
amazingly short distance that he opened the door, and then he disappeared
before a word could be said to him.

     Mrs. Williams who, notwithstanding all her threats, seemed to have a
lingering impression that she was victimised in the transaction, had all the
ire of her nature aroused at once by the sight of Jack, and she at once 
rushed
after him, leaving the admiral and the Bannerworths not at all lamenting her
loss.

     Jack had no idea that he would be followed by anybody but the admiral,
and to distance him he knew there was no occasion to run; so, when he had 
got
down to the hall of the hotel, he subsided into a walk, until he heard a
tremendous scuffling of feet behind him, and, upon looking round, saw Mrs.
Williams in full chase, and with an expression upon her countenance which
plainly enough indicated that her intentions were not at all of a jocular
character.

     "The devil!" said Jack; "if here ain't Mother Williams coming full 
sail,
and at fourteen knots an hour, too, with a fair wind, I'll be bound.  Never
mind-- a stern chase is a long chase, so here goes."

     As Jack uttered these remarks, he dashed onwards at tremendous speed; 
but
the sight of him again, had inflamed Mrs. Williams's wrath to madness, and 
she
made the most incredible exertion to come up with him, so that it was really
wonderful to see her.

     But Jack, being less encumbered by apparel than the lady, would have
distanced her, but for an unlucky accident, that gave her a temporary 
mastery.
The fates would have it, that a baker with a tray upon his head, containing
sundry pies, was coming up the street, and as people do sometimes, when they
are mutually anxious to pass each other without coming in contact, they 
dodged
from side to side for a few seconds, and then, of course, ran against each
other as if they really meant it, with such force, that down came Jack, and
baker, and pies, in one grand smash.

     In another moment the enraged Mrs. Williams reached the spot.

     To snatch up the only whole pie there was left, was to the lady the 
work
of a moment, and to reverse it upon Jack's face, was the work of another
moment; and then, in the vindictiveness of her rage, she stamped upon the
bottom of the dish until his head was embedded in damsons, and he was nearly
smothered.

     From the window of the inn the Bannerworths and the admiral saw all 
this
take place, and the delight of the old man was of the most extravagant
character, exceeding all bounds, while the Bannerworths, for the life of 
them,
could not help laughing most heartily.

     "Now, you wretch!" said Mrs. Williams, "I hope this will be a lesson to
you.  Take that-- and that-- and that, you sea-snake! you odious tar-
barrel!"

     As she spoke, she hammered on the dish till it broke, and that was for
Jack the best thing that could have happened, for it gave him a little air,
and by a frantic effort he scrambled to a sitting posture, and commenced
dragging the damsons out of his eyes and mouth.  Mrs. Williams then thought 
it
was high time to leave, and so muttering threats, to the immense amusement 
of
a crowd of persons who had assembled, she walked away, leaving Jack by no
means delighted with the end of the adventure, and to settle with the
infuriated baker as best he might.

     It was no small additional mortification to Jack to look up and see the
admiral and the Bannerworths at the window of the hotel, enjoying his
discomfiture, and laughing most heartily at his expense.

 Next week:  A Change of Scene and Circumstances. -- An Event in London.




                               CHAPTER CXXVII.

A CHANGE OF SCENE AND CIRCUMSTANCES. -- AN EVENT IN LONDON.


     The recent events which followed each other so rapidly, were strangely
concluded by the sudden and mysterious disappearance of Sir Francis Varney.
That he should thus have eluded all, was aggravating to a very large class 
of
people, who seemed to insist that he should have come to some notable
catastrophe.

     "Had he only been killed," they argued, "we should have known the last 
of
him."

     Of the truth of this there could be no doubt.  When a man is dead and
buried, you do, as far as human nature serves, know the end of him; but this
great fact does not always come within the knowledge of men, who sometimes,
contrary to expectation, drop off themselves, and instead of knowing the end
of somebody else, why, somebody else knows the end of them.

     It is a well known fact, that as some die before others, that it does
sometimes happen that those who wish to see another out, may be seen out
themselves; besides, taking the question of longevity aside, it does not
follow, because we so wish to come to the conclusion of an affair, that its
author may but change the scene, and transport it elsewhere, and the good 
and
curious lieges become defrauded of their self-satisfying knowledge, viz., 
the
end of the affair.

     Of course it was an aggravation, to know that there was an interesting
and highly exciting affair gone off, and they were not allowed to peep into
that mystery, the future; but so it was -- they were not gratified.

     Some were of the opinion that he had departed this life in a mysterious
and unsatisfactory, because secret manner, and that was why nobody could 
tell
anything about it.

     But there were other opinions afloat, and among others, that of the
admiral, which was pretty general, which was, that he had very likely
disappeared from that part of the world to seek in some other place the
renovation his system required, by means that were natural to him, but 
hideous
in others to contemplate or think of.

     This was generally the received opinion, for it was universally 
admitted
by the wise people thereabouts, that he must at certain times recruit 
himself.

     The opinion thus entertained by all who lived thereabouts, became less
and less absorbing; other matters began to be thought of, things began to 
flow
into their usual channel, and a subsidence took place in the turmoil and
excitement consequent upon the presence of the vampyre.

     About this period, while these parts were regaining their original
serenity and calmness, and while the vampyre was looked upon as an awful and
fearful episode in the life of those who lived there, there happened in 
London
a circumstance that it is necessary to relate to the reader, inasmuch as it 
is
very important, and bears strongly on our story.

     Not far from Bloomsbury-square, which, at the period of our story, was 
a
very fashionable place, and in one of the first streets thereabout, was the
house of a widow, whose name was Meredith.  She had been the wife of a man 
in
good circumstances, but at his death she was left with a house filled with
furniture, some little loose cash, and several daughters, marriageable and
unmarriageable, this being all Mr. Meredith had to leave.

     There could be but one way of obtaining a living -- at least, but one
that suggested itself to her, which was to turn lodging-house keeper of the
better sort.  Her children had been well educated, that is, sufficiently so,
to pass off in life, in decent society, without any particular remark.

     As she was well calculated for the object she had in view, it was no
wonder that she succeeded in her undertaking, and appeared to do very well.

     About this time an arrival occurred at an hotel not very far from this
spot, which caused a communication to pass to Mrs. Meredith, who had been
recommended lodgers from the hotel, when any of the inmates desired to be
accommodated, and wished for a place with all the comforts of a home, and
domestic attention.

     "Mrs. Meredith," said the head waiter of the hotel, "I wish to have a
word in private with you."

     "With greatest pleasure, Mr. Jones," said Mrs. Meredith, who was
extremely civil to the waiter; "will you be pleased to sit down."

     "I have not the time, I thank you -- I have not time; but I have run 
over
to you to inform you we have an old invalid colonel at our place, who seems 
as
if he did not know what he wanted; he wants some kind of lodging -- he don't
like the hotel -- whether there is some genteel family, whose kind 
attentions
would soothe his disorders, and, I suppose, his temper."

     "Oh, poor gentleman," said Mrs. Meredith; "how unfortunate he should
suffer -- is he rich?"

     "Yes, I believe so -- very rich, he's a colonel in the India service;
he's been a fine man, but he has had some hard knocks. I have seen more
ricketty matters than he before to-day, and he will do very well.  I told 
him
I knew where there was a lady who occasionally admitted an inmate to her
house, which was a large one, but she must be satisfied that her lodger is a
gentleman.

     "'Has she any family?' he inquired; 'because I hate to go where there's
nobody but the lady of the house, because she can't always attend upon me,
read to me, and the like of that.'"

     "Goodness me, what an odd man!"

     "Yes, but he pays well; a retired colonel -- large fortune. You know 
that
these East Indians expect I don't know what; they are even fed by beautiful
young black virgins."

     "The wretch!"

     "Oh, dear, no; it's the custom of the country; so, you see, he's been
humoured, and it will be necessary yet to humour him, if you mean to have 
him
for your lodger.  I expect he'll only be troublesome; but, when they pay for
trouble, why, it's all profit."

     "Very true," replied Mrs. Meredith; "is he a single man?"

     "Yes, oh, yes; I believe he has never been married; has had so much to 
do
in India, that he had nothing to do with marriages."

     "Where does he come from?"

     "India.  I believe he had a very fine palace of his own, at
Puttytherapore, so I'm told.  Lord, he seems to think nothing of these parts 
--
but he's an odd man; however, as he pays well, he'll make a good lodger
anywhere."

     "Well, you may tell him, Mr. Jones, that we have a fine suite of rooms
for his accommodation on the first floor, and bed rooms -- every attention 
he
can wish.  You know our terms, Mr. Jones, I think -- but I may as well tell
you -- five guineas a-week."

     "Five guineas a-week, eh?"

     "Yes; that is moderate, when you come to consider what a trouble and an
expense it will be to get such things as will please the palate of an 
Indian."

     "It is a trouble, certainly."

     "And, besides that, he will have such a place and furniture as he 
seldom
meets with in London; besides, from what you say, there will be little 
trouble
in attending to him by myself and daughters, and you know I have several."

     "Exactly -- exactly; that is the thing he seems to desire; you will,
therefore, have a preference over any one else who may have anything that he
wants -- a kind of domestic hearth; he has none of his own, you see."

     "Has he no friends?"

     "None living, I dare say; besides, he would hardly like to trust 
himself
along with relations, who would poison him for the sake of his money; and, 
if
he have any living, he may know nothing of them, where they are, or anything
else, and they would be as strangers to him, for he would not be able to
recognize them -- but I must go now.  Five guineas -- that includes all?"

     "Yes; all, except wines and liquors, you know."

     "Very well, I'll let him know; and, perhaps, you'll be in the way, in
case he should come round this evening to examine the place."

     "Do you think there is any chance of his coming in to-night."

     "Really, I cannot tell; he may, or may not, just as he pleases -- he is
an odd fish; but, good Mrs. Meredith, I will talk to him."

     The waiter left; and Mrs. Meredith sat in her parlour, which was her 
own
private apartment, which she and her daughters usually retired to and 
received
their own friends.  Here they remained, in some degree kept in continual
expectation; nothing was said, for some time, by either mother or daughter,
for there was but one at home at that time.

     "Do you know, Margaret," she said, "we are likely to have a new 
lodger?"

     "Indeed, ma?"

     "Yes, my dear; he is a fidgetty old man, a colonel from India; he is
vastly rich, I am given to understand, and will require all the attentions 
of
a relative.  He will pay very handsomely; in fact, my dear, he will keep us
all with a little care and management."

     "Well, ma, the men ought to do so, the creatures! -- what are they for,
if they don't.  I'm sure, if ever I come to marry, which I am sure I 
sha'n't,
and if I found that he didn't find me in all I wanted, wouldn't I lead him a
life! -- I rather think I would," said the amiable child; "I'd never let him
know peace night nor day.  It would be useless for him to tell me misfortune
had deprived him of means; that would do for me.  Oh, dear, no; a married 
man
has no right to meet misfortunes; indeed, he deserves to be punished for
having a wife at all under such circumstances."

     "A very proper spirit, my dear; but you must never let such a thing as
that pass your lips, because it would be very likely to cause you to lose a
chance; the men are so fastidious now a-days, and they think they win us, 
when
we angle for, and catch them."

     And this lodger, ma?"

     "Oh, he's, as I told you, a rich old East Indian."

     At this moment, a coach drove up to the door, and a tremendous double 
rap
was played off upon the door, as if it had been committed by a steam- 
engine;
so loud and so long was the application for the admittance, that both mother
and daughter started.

     "Dear me, that must be him," said the mother; "yes, a coach and all --
there -- there, I declare."

     "What, ma?"

     "Why, look at that girl next door out in the balcony; there's Miss 
Smith -
- that girl is always trying to attract some person or other; and the men
affect to believe that she is beautiful; for my part, I think a girl of
seventeen ought to have more modesty."

     "The hussy!" said the young lady, contemptuously.

     The servant now entered to inform her that a gentleman had called about
the apartments.

     "Ask him up stairs," said Mrs. Meredith; and she prepared to follow the
colonel so soon as she heard he was ascending the stairs, which was a slow 
job
to him, as he walked lame, with a gold headed cane.

     When Mrs. Meredith came to the room, she saw a tall gentleman; his 
height
was lost, on account of him stooping; he wore a green shade over one eye, 
and
he had one arm in a sling; besides which, as we have before related, he was
rather lame.

     "Not so bad as I thought for," muttered Mrs. Meredith, to herself, as 
she
curtseyed to his salute.

     "I have been recommended to seek here a lodging, ma'am.  I do not know 
if
I am correct in believing you have such as I want."

     "This, sir, is the sitting-room; it is a very handsome one, and above
what is visually offered at a lodging-house.  The fact is, sir, the house 
was
never furnished for letting, but for our own private occupation; therefore, 
it
has all of the comforts of a private residence."

     "That is what I chiefly want.  You see, I do not care to undertake the
trouble of setting up an establishment myself.  I am alone, I may say;
therefore it is I seek such a lodging as comes nearest to what I should 
myself
choose if I were to make a home of my own."

     "Precisely, sir.  There is the back drawing-room, and a bed room up-
stairs."

     "Oh, very good; I need, I presume, make no inquiry as to what kind of
table you keep; the best, I dare say.  I was informed of the price you 
asked."

     "Yes; we consider that quite moderate, sir."

     "I dare say," said the Indian, looking about the place with an air of
curiosity; "I dare say."

     "Yes, sir; you see the advantages we offer are much above the usual 
run. 
Besides, you are an invalid, and will require extra attention."

     "Yes;  there is much truth in that; I have used to it, and therefore 
you
will see that I bargain for it; but, at the same time, you will not find me
difficult to please, I flatter myself; but we shall know more of each other
the longer we are together."

     "Certainly, sir.  I can assure you, that should you take the 
apartments,
nothing on my part, or my daughters', will be wanting to make your stay
agreeable."

     The stranger examined the appearance of the room, and the others, and
then, after much conversation with them, he agreed to take the lodgings, and
to come into them on the morrow, as he was extremely particular as to well-
aired beds, and should require them all to be re-aired.

     "And now, madam, before I finally agree to come in, will you show me 
the
means of escape, if any, in case of fire.  I am anxious about that; I have
read so many calamities arising from that cause of late in London that I am
somewhat nervous about it, though I am so much of an invalid that I should
hardly be able to avail myself of it."

     "You shall see, sir," said Mrs. Meredith; "we have ample and safe
accommodation in that respect.  You see, here is a pair of broad steps that
lead up to that door -- a trap-door; and here is another, that opens upon 
the
leads at the top of the house."

     The colonel made shift to walk up, and to look over the house-tops; 
there
was a sea of chimneys and pantiles, at the same time they were all easy of
access on this side of the street; so there was no danger from fire, and 
each
house there was similarly provided.

     "Well, madam, I think I may say that this affair is concluded.  I will
leave you my card, and, if you think proper, you can obtain what information
you desire of me at the hotel."

     "I am quite satisfied, sir," said the landlady, as she took the card 
that
was proffered her, and also a bank-note which he offered her, in token of 
his
taking possession of the lodgings.

     Mrs. Meredith curtseyed, and the colonel left the apartment, and
descended the staircase with great deliberation, for he could not go very
swiftly; he was lame, and one arm was up in a sling, and therefore he had 
not
the free use of his limbs.

     As he came down the stairs, and when near the mat, Margaret, the eldest
daughter, came out and passed into the back parlour, for no other ostensible
purpose than that of seeing the stranger, whose eye was instantly, but only
momentarily, fixed upon her; but it was enough; they both saw each other, 
and
had a glance at the features, and Margaret disappeared.

     The stranger stepped into the coach, and, as the door was being shut, 
he
looked up to the windows of the next house, where the young lady, nothing
daunted, still sat at the window; and so little was she interested with her
neighbour's affairs, that she barely bestowed a momentary glance upon the
coach or its occupant, whose solitary optic took notice of her, and then the
 Jehu drove away with his rumbling vehicle.

     "Well, I never saw such impudence, in my life!" said Mrs. Meredith, as
she came to the parlour-windows, which happened to bow outwards, and gave 
her
a better opportunity of watching her neighbours to the right and left of 
her.

     "What is the matter, ma'?" inquired her daughter.

     "Why, there's that minx still up yonder.  I declare if she didn't stare
at the colonel; he saw her, and noticed her, too. Well, I wouldn't have had
her there to-day for a trifle; he will think he has got into a bad
neighbourhood, seeing her so bold. Really, now, she lays herself open to all
kinds of imputations. I do not mean to say any evil of her; but, really, if
she will do that now, what will she not do by-and-bye?  I am sorry she has 
no
one to advise her better."

     "I am sure she is old enough to know better," rejoined the daughter. "I
am quite sure she's no beauty, and, if she wants to catch any of the men, 
she
won't be successful in that manner; unless, indeed, she doesn't care whom 
she
picks up with."

     "Oh, that is, I fear, too often the case with young girls with weak
intellects.  But did you see our new lodger, my dear?"

     "Yes, ma'."

     "And what did you think of him?" inquired Mrs. Meredith, with an 
amiable
whine, and a gentle rubbing of hands.

     "Think, ma', think -- what can I think of a man whom I have hardly 
seen,
ma'?  He only passed me; I could not recollect him again if I tried."

     "Ah, well, my dear, you know best.  I can always recollect people whom 
I
have once seen?  He is a very fine man -- at least, he has been; he has lost
much of his height, for he is lame, and stoops much; but still he has been a
handsome man."

     "One eye, only, ma', I think."

     "Yes, my dear, one eye, as you say; but I think a remarkably keen one,
too.  He's quite the gentleman, too; he's been used to command, you can see
that.  These military men have an air about them that you cannot mistake; 
and
even this gentleman, though, you see, wounded and lame, yet he has the air 
of
an officer about him."

     "He may have, ma'; but, you know, if he have the air of a general, with
nothing else, it would buy a very poor dinner."

     "So it would, my dear.  You certainly are an extraordinary girl,
Margaret, a very extraordinary girl, and will be the making of your family.
Only suppose you should marry this rich colonel, what then, eh?  I only say,
suppose you were to marry him? -- because it isn't certain, yet -- well,
wouldn't that minx next door think you were lucky?  She would bite her nails
in anger."

     "Yes, she would, ma'; but it may never happen.  But, if she thinks to 
get
a beau that way, she's much mistaken.  I am sure she will get insulted."

     "No wonder.  But, Margaret, my dear, you must do your best to please 
this
gentleman; he wants to have people about him just as if he had his own home. 
He has no friends or relatives; who knows what may happen yet?"

     "No, ma'; we don't know what may happen, and I will do my best to 
please
him; but I sha'n't court him, you know, ma'; he must do that."

     "Yes, certainly, my child, he must.  No; you mustn't appear anxious 
about
it; but merely say you are pleased to have his good opinion, and you must be 
a
little coy of everything else; for there are times when such old gentlemen 
are
easily entrapped. But I must set about having things aired and put into 
order
for his arrival to-morrow."

                                     -+-

Next week:  The New Lodger. -- The Night Alarm. -- A Mysterious 
Circumstance.




                              CHAPTER CXXVIII.

THE NEW LODGER. -- A NIGHT ALARM. -- A MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE.


     It was not until late the next day that Mrs. Meredith heard anything of
her new lodger.  All she had heard was that he would be there during the 
day,
but whether to breakfast, dinner, or tea, she could not tell which, and now
she was waiting with expectation, if not anxiety; but, at the same time, she
knew she was quite sure of her lodger, because she held his bank-note.

     It had been a dull day; there are many such in London, and therefore 
that
was no singular circumstance.  It was one of those dull, leaden-coloured 
days
of which you can predict nothing with certainty, or even a chance of being
right; it was rather squally at times, and at others a west wind blew; not
cold -- at least, not particularly so; but, yet, notwithstanding the heavy
appearance of the sky, there was a clear white light that made every object
look more disagreeable than ordinary.

     The landlady and her daughter were both on the _qui vive_, as it is
called, looking out for their new lodger, whom they expected the more
immediately as the evening drew on, for there was less likelihood of his
coming in the middle of the day than towards the evening, and less after
evening had set in than before, for he was an invalid.

     It was, they thought, just about the time when he must arrive, when 
there
could only be the uncertainty of a few minutes.  The whole house was in 
order;
nothing was left to chance; Mrs. Meredith herself had gone over the whole
place, and took especial pains to find all sorts of fault with the 
unfortunate
drudge who did the work, of course, aided by the mother and daughter; but
such aid was distressing, because she had to wait upon both, and do her own
work as well.

     However, all was in readiness, and they were looking out at every coach
from between the blinds.  The sound of wheels was enough to cause them to
start, when suddenly a coach drove up to the door, upon which had been
carefully packed several leather boxes and portmanteaus.

     "Here he is," said the daughter; "here he is."

     "Yes; and, as I am alive," said Mrs. Meredith, as she cast her eye
upwards towards the next house, "as I am alive, there is that girl again.  I
do believe that she does it on purpose.  It is done to aggravate me, and to
attract attention from the men.  The hussy!"

     There was now no time to lose, the knocker at the door giving pretty
clear indication that instant attention upon their part was requisite, and 
up
jumped Mrs. Meredith and her daughter Margaret.  Immediately the servant
opened the door into the passage, the coach door was opened, the steps let
clattering down, and Colonel Deverill entered the house.

     "Will you walk into the parlour, colonel," inquired Mrs. Meredith, 
"until
your boxes are all in, and you see they are all correct?  There is a good
fire."

     "Thank you, madam," said the colonel, with some difficulty walking 
along. 
"I am scarcely so well able to walk as I was yesterday."

     "Ah! colonel, you must have suffered much.  But I am glad the parlour 
is
so handy-- it will save you the walk up stairs at present, until you are 
quite
recovered from your fatigue.  Pray be seated, colonel, by the fire.  The man
shall bring them in, and lay them before the door."

     "Thank you," said the colonel, and he sat down in a large easy chair,
having first dropped his cloak, which was a large blue military cloak, lined
with white, with a fur collar, and looked extremely rich and handsome; 
beneath
which he wore an officer's undress frock, covered over with a profusion of
braid.

     The boxes and portmanteaus were brought in and laid down so that the
colonel could see them; and, when that was done, the coachman made his 
demand,
which excited an exclamation of horror from Mrs. Meredith, and a declaration
that she thought hackney coachmen were the greatest impostors and 
extortioners
under the sun.  There never was such a set as hackney coachmen -- never!

     "Saving lodging-house keepers, ma'am-- axing your pardon for saying so. 
Not that I means any offence, only I lived in one once, and ought to know
summat."

     The colonel, however, made no remark, but, pulling out an embroidered
purse, which appeared to full of gold, he paid the man his demand.

     "Thank you, your honour; you are one of the right sort, and no 
mistake." 
So saying, the coachman walked away, jinking the money as he walked along 
the
passage, until he came to the door where the girl was standing, and then,
giving her a knowing wink, and jerking his head backwards, he said, --

     "They are a scaley lot here, ain't they, Mary?"

     "Mary!" screamed Margaret.

     "Yes, miss."

     "Shut the door, and come away form that insolent fellow."

     Slam went the door, and then the servant went down stairs, and the
parlour-door was immediately closed, and the colonel was given into the 
tender
mercies of the lodging-house heeper; for, though she pretended that she 
merely
offered a genteel and presentable house for such as desired it, and could
afford to pay for it, she was, in every sense of the word, a lodging-house
keeper.

     The colonel, however, sat very composedly in his chair, and gazed at 
the
fire in silence; and from time to time he gazed at the mother and daughter
with his one eye; he had not lost the entire use of the other, but had a 
green
silk shade over it.  He watched what went on, and replied cautiously to what
was said to him, but appeared inclined to silence, and occasionally abrupt 
in
his coversation; but this they attributed to the habit he must have been in,
when abroad, of commanding.

     "Will you take tea at once, colonel, or at what hour do you choose to
have it?"

     "I will take it at once.  I am tired."

     "What will you take, sir?" inquired Margaret, at one end of the table;
and, placing herself in an enticing posture, she awaited the answer, 
expecting
to be looked at.

     "Coffee," said the colonel, abruptly.

     There was a pause; but Margaret said nothing more, and set about doing
such little matters as appeared to be an employment.  But it was a mere
deception -- it was all done; nothing had been left undone; they had taken
care of that, as the servant knew full well.

     However, there was little that passed of any peculiar character on that
occasion, for the evening passed off very calmly and comfortable, the 
colonel
giving his opinion  somewhat dogmatically; but that, of course was submitted
to, as he was a military man and had much experience, and, moreover, he was 
a
rich man -- quite a nabob.

     It is astonishing, as a general rule, what people will submit to when 
it
comes from those who have riches at command.  That fact alone seems to stamp
all that is foolish and absurd, coming from such a quarter, with sense and
worth.

     It is in vain for any one not blessed with property to talk; his 
talking
is nothing in comparison with what falls from the lips of the man who has
property.  You are talked down, and if you are obstinate, and won't be 
talked
down, why, you are a disagreeable fellow, a dissatisfied man, and your
neighbours ought to set their faces against you.

     Thus, through life, he who does not submit to the wealthy, is always 
run
down, and there is every disposition, if possible, of running him off the 
road
altogether, no matter how great the injustice against him, and the enormity 
of
the conduct of others; they are, as they think, justified, because he is not
a genteel person; in fact, he is not evangelical.

     The evening passed over, as we have said, in calmness and quiet, and 
Mrs.
Meredith appeared to be well pleased with her lodger; and, at a moderately
early hour, they separated and went to bed.  The colonel retired, after 
taking
leave of them, to his own room, complaining he was in great pain, and scarce
able to walk, and so cold, he was nearly benumbed.

     "This climate," he said, "is so cold, so moist, and altogether so
uncomfortable, that I cannot understand how it is people ever endure it. 
Indeed," he continued to Mrs. Meredith, "there must be some great difference
between rich and poor in their conformation, else they couldn't stand it."

     Of course, Mrs. Meredith assented to the proposition, as she would have
done to any other, no matter what proposition, that had been so urged by 
such
a person.

     Thus it was with the colonel, who appeared very well satisfied with his
lodgings; and all parties, for so short a time, were well pleased with each
other.

          *             *             *             *             *

     The night was dark, that is to say, it was one of those nights in which
neither moon nor stars showed themselves; no sound was heard through the
streets, save the heavy step of the guardian of the night, or the midnight
reveller, who might be finding his way homeward boisterously, and with 
scarce
enough sense to enable him to take the right path.

     There were clouds enough to have intercepted the moon, but there was a
kind of light that was spread through them that you saw when you looked up,
but which aided not the traveller below; but, then, there were countless 
lamps
that illumined the streets.

     At that time there was a man creeping over the house-tops.  He had 
gained
the housetop of Mr. Smith, the house in which resided Miss Smith, who had
given so much offence to Mrs. Meredith by sitting so much out in the 
balcony. 
He stooped in the gutter, and looked cautiously around; no human being was
within sight; he was alone, and no soul saw him.

     Cautiously he crept towards the trap-door -- it was bolted; but that 
was
soon obviated -- no sound, however, could be heard.  The soft, but rotten,
wood gave way under the steady pressure exerted upon the door, which at 
length
opened.

     He paused a moment or two, and listened carefully for several minutes. 
Then he entered the loft slowly and noiselessly, keeping as low as possible,
so that he might run no risk of being observed by any one who might be 
passing
the house, or who might be up by accident in any of the opposite houses, in
consequence of illness, or any other cause.

     There was a lower trap-door through which the figure passed.  There 
could
be no difficulty in passing, because that was always kept open, as it was
considered to assist in ventilating the house; and then the intruder stood
within the house.

     He then drew himself up to his full height, and paused for some 
moments,
as if considering the next step he would take; but then he descended to the
second floor, on which were placed what are called the best bedrooms. He
paused at one, gently tried the handle, and finding it turn, and the door
open, he gave one look towards the stairs that he had just descended, and 
then
he entered the apartment.

     All was yet still; no sound met his ear, save the breathing of the
sleeper within, who lay in a sweet sleep, and was as calm and unconscious as
the blessed; perfect rest and forgetfulness had steeped the senses of the
young girl, who lay in ambrosial sleep.  One arm was thrown outside the
clothes, and revealed, in all its symmetry, a snow-white bosom, heaving 
gently
to the throbbing of the heart.

     The intruder gazed at the young girl for some moments, and clasped his
hands with trembling eagerness, and a ghastly smile played upon his terrible
features, while a fearful fire shot from the eyes of one who thus disturbed
the slumbers of the living.

     He approached the bed, and took the hand within his own, and then the
sleeper awoke.  It would be impossible to describe the look of terror and
horror that sat on the young girl's face.

     She could not scream, she could not utter a sound; her whole faculties
appeared to have been bound up for a short time.  She could not even shrink
from the horrible being who approached her, she was so perfectly
horror-stricken with that truly horrible countenance, the glance of which
seemed as if it would destroy the power of speech for ever.  She shrank now,
but could not move.

     The creature crept closer.  It seized her hand, and held it within its
own; but even that could not awake her from the trance she was in.  She felt 
a
horrible sinking feeling, as though she must sink through the very flooring 
of
the house, and yet she could not stir.

     It appeared as though, so long as the hideous face was opposed to 
her's,
so long she was unable to move; it was a species of fascination; however 
great
the horror felt, yet there was no help for it.  She could not ever shut her
eyes; that boon was denied her.

     What she saw cannot be described.  It is by far too horrible for pen to
describe.  The wild horrible insanity that appeared in the eyes of the
creature, with their peculiar cast, was indescribable; the only light that
entered the room, at that moment, came from a lamp below, and illumined only
the upper part of the room above the window sills.

     The creature then stood in relief against this light, a horrible dark
object, whose glaring eyeballs were too terrible ever to be forgotten.

     Then, again, while he with one hand held her's, he passed his other 
hand
up her arm, and then felt along the soft, white flesh with its cold, clammy
fingers, as if it were feeling for something, or greedy of the velvet-like
substance.

     Still keeping the eyes fixed upon the hapless and helpless girl, he 
drew
the arm towards him, and, leaning upon the bed, suddenly plunged his face on
the arm, and held and seized it near the middle with its teeth, and then it
made an attempt to suck the wound.

     This, however, broke the charm, horrible and complete as it was; for 
the
creature's hideous countenance was lost to her sight, as he plunged his face
to her arm.

     Shriek followed shriek in quick and rapid succession.  The whole house
was alarmed by the terrible shrieks that came from the apartment.  She
struggled, and by a sudden effort, she disengaged herself from the grasp of
the fiend, and rolled, wrapped up in the bed-clothes, to the other side of
the floor.

     The monster still pursued her with greedy thirst for blood, and had
picked her up, and again placed her on the bed, with more than mere human
strength, and again sought the arm he had been deprived of by the sudden
effort of the young girl.


     "Help! help! Mother! father! help! help!"

     The shouts rang through the house, awaking the affrighted sleepers from
their repose, in a manner that may be called distressing.

     It is distressing in the midst of a large city to be awoke, in the dead
of the night, by loud and urgent cries of distress.  It is such a contrast 
to
the dead stillness that reigns around, and when the first cries are heard, 
it
creates a terror and surprise that takes away all power of action.

     It was not till the cries had been heard a second time that the inmates
aroused themselves; the fact was, they were fearful of fire.  The moment 
that
idea floated across their minds, then, indeed, they started up, and the 
father
of the young girl, hearing the fall, at once rushed to the room of his
daughter.  He arrived but in time; the hideous monster, being affrighted by
the footsteps approaching him, turned from his blood-stained feast, and hid
himself beneath the drapery, as the father entered the room.

     "Mary," he said, "Mary! Mary! what means this-- what can be the matter-
-
are you hurt-- how come you in this disorder?"

     "Oh, God! that thing from the grave has been sucking my blood from my
veins.  See-- see yonder-- he moves!  Watch him-- note him, father!"

     Believing she raved, her father paid no attention to what she did say,
but continued to regard her with sorrow and regret, for he believed it to be
a sudden attack of mania; but seeing the curtains move, he turned his head,
and at once divined it to be the cause of his daughter's alarm.

     The glance was but momentary; but he saw the figure of a man who was
escaping from the apartment by the door by which he had at that moment
entered.

     "Help!" he shouted -- "help-- thieves-- murder!"

     And as he shouted, he rushed after the figure that was flying towards 
the
top of the house.  By this time the house was filled up with people, and the
noise up stairs had caused the servants below to rise confused and 
thoroughly
terrifed by the sounds they heard, and the cries of their master.

     At that moment, one of those watchful guardians of the night passed by
the house, and was immediately hailed by the unfortunate people below, who
were afraid to go up stairs to offer any assistance, lest they might be
knocked back again, which fear stopped all aid from below.

     "Hilloa! what's the matter now?" inquired the worthy guardian of the
night.

     "Oh, I don't know-- goodness knows.  You had better go up and see.  
I'll
come up after you.  Don't be afraid; I'll come up after you, if you'll go
first."

     "Stop a moment while I spring my rattle," said the worthy functionary;
who thereupon gave an alarming peal upon his instrument, and then he entered
the house, with instructions to the servant to run down stairs and let any 
of
his party in that might come up.

     Then the guardian of the night hastened up stairs with all the haste he
could, and came up just in time to pick Mr. Smith up, who was lying stunned 
at
the foot of the stairs.

     The fact was, Mr. Smith had pursued his adversay too quickly, and 
finding
he could not get off, he turned round and felled him to the earth, like an 
ox. 
It was just at this juncture when the charley came up stairs, and in another
moment Mr. Smith recovered.

     "What's the matter?" inquired the watchman; "is the house on fire."

     "No, no; the vampyre-- the vampyre!"

     "Eh-- what?  Never heard on 'im afore-- never seed him."

     "Quick-- quick! he has gone up stairs.  Quick-- after him!" said Mr.
Smith, as he ran up the stairs, and was quickly followed by the watchman and
some others who now crowded about, having had time to dress themselves and
come to Mr. Smith's aid; and they now crowded to the house-top, for they saw
the trap-door was unfastened, though it had been hastily pushed to.  This 
they
opened, and then looked on the house-top, first one way, and then another.

     "He ain't here," said the watchman, "and we mustn't expect to find him
here; he wouldn't wait for us, you may depend upon that.  We had better 
search
along the house-tops till we see him, or find some of the other traps open,
and then you may guess where he has gone."

     "The difficulty is, which way did he go?" said Mr. Smith.

     "Oh, I saw him go that way," said another watchman, who came up stairs,
having been first attracted by the sounds of the rattle, and then, looking 
up
at the house, he saw the figure of a man stealing, with great rapidity of
motion, across the house-tops.

     "There I lost him, then," he said.  "I didn't see him after that spot;
but he may have gone further, for all I can say to the contrary.  But we 
shall
soon see."

     "This trap-door is open," said the other watchman, as he pulled aside
Mrs. Meredith's trap-door, which had only been pushed to.  "We had better go
in here, and see if he isn't gone somewhere into the house, and hiding 
himself
until all is quiet, and then he will make off if left alone."

 Next Time: The Unsuccessful Pursuit. -- Mr. Smith's Disappointment, and the
 Testimony of Mrs. Meredith.



                                CHAPTER CXXIX.

THE UNSUCCESSFUL PURSUIT. -- MR. SMITH'S DISAPPOINTMENT, AND THE TESTIMONY 
OF
MRS. MEREDITH.


     Mrs. Meredith and her daughters had long sunk into deep sleep before 
the
events just narrated took place in her neighbour's house.  There was a 
perfect
stillness; the whole house appeared as though there were no living soul 
within
it, all was so still and quiet.

     Presently, however, there was a terrific sound; it was like that of a
human being falling and bumping down stairs, and then there was a great deal
of shouting and calling, and Mrs. Meredith opened her eyes and trembled in 
her
bed, while her daughter Margaret, who upon the occasion slept with her, was
likewise as frightened.

     "What is th-- that?" she stammered, with some difficulty.

     "Oh, hear, I cannot think.  Thieves-- murderers, I dare say.  Oh,
merciful Heaven! what shall we do-- where shall I go?  We shall be 
murdered!"

     Both females trembled in their beds, and were quite unable to move,
breaking out in a profuse sweat from fear; and yet the noise came nearer and
nearer, and there were many persons evidently in the house; their numbers 
were
so numerous that they evidently didn't care to conceal themselves.

     The fact was this: when Mr. Smith and his party found the trap-door 
open,
they descended into the house, the watchman leading the way; but in going 
down
the ladder, his foot slipped, and he came with a dreadful thump on the 
landing,
and fortunately he rolled up against the servant girl's door, instead of 
down
stairs.  The door flew open, and the girl was too terrified to speak for 
some
moments.

     At length the watchman having got up, he made for the bed, upon which 
the
girl jumped up, and began to scream out for help in piteous tones.

     "Come, come-- don't be frightened," said the watchman; "get up and show
us over the house."

     "Well, I'm sure!" said the girl, who had recovered some of her 
assurance,
for the coat, stick, and lantern of the watchman at once assured her that 
she
was in no immediate danger whatever.  "Well, I'm sure! to think of coming in 
a
female's room in this manner.  You ought to be ashamed of yourself, you old
wretch, you ought!"

     "No names.  If you don't get up and show us over, and call your master-
--"

     "I ain't got a master."

     "Well, your mistress, then-- we will go ourselves, and we'll soon make
short work of it.  Come, come, no nonsense.  We will dress you ourselves."

     "You monster!  Go out of the room, can't you?  Have you no decency left
you?  I'll get up; but I'll lay a complaint before the lord mayor, and he
shall tell you a different tale to this.  I'm ashamed of you, and so you 
ought
to be of yourselves."

     However, during this energetic remonstrance, she contrived to shuffle 
on
some things, and when she was ready, she came down to her mistress's door, 
and
then began to hammer and kick at it, saying, --

     "Oh, Mrs. Meredith, here's sich a lot of men in the house.  Do come 
out,
mem.  I don't know what's the matter; but they'll break into your room, as
they broke into mine."

     "What do they want, Mary?"

     "Don't know, mem."

     "There is some one escaped into your house that has broken into the 
next
house, and your trap-doors on the roof were open."

     "Gracious me!" said Mrs. Meredith -- "gracious me!  Show them over the
place, Mary.  We will get up in a few moments, and come to you.  Margaret, 
my
dear, get up; some housebreakers have got into the house, and we shall all 
be
murdered in our sleep if we don't find them.  Oh, dear, dear! what will 
become
of us?  What will our new lodger say to this disturbance?"

     Margaret made no reply, but began to dress herself, while the party 
began
their search; and Mr. Smith hastened back to his daughter, to understand the
nature of the attack that had been made upon her, and whether she were any
better than she was when he left her.

     However, when he came to hear what was the real cause of her terror, to
find the marks on her arm, and the certainty that nothing had been lost or
moved, he was perfectly staggered, and hastened back after the party he had
left, to make some further attempt to follow the miscreant, and to discover,
if possible, his retreat, and bring him to justice for the vile attack he 
had
made.

     When he returned, he met Mrs. Meredith coming out of her room, she 
having
hastily dressed herself, followed by her daughter.

     "Oh! Mr. Smith-- Mr. Smith, what is the meaning of all this 
disturbance?
Here are a number of strange men, who have forced themselves into my house,
and whether their object is our property or our lives, we cannot tell.  What
can I do, Mr. Smith?"

     "You have nothing to fear, ma'am."

     "Nothing to fear, sir!  Why, is not such an occurrence something to be
feared for its own sake alone?"

     "Yes, ma'am, it is very disagreeable, I am willing to admit; but I
presume you would not give refuge to a vampyre?"

     "A what, sir?"

     "A vampyre, madam.  I know not how to explain it to you, but I have to
assure you my daughter has been attacked in her sleep by the midnight
blood-sucker from the graves.  Oh! God, that such a thing should happen in 
my
family.  I would not have believed it, had the same been related to me from
anybody else."

     "It must have been the night mare," suggested Mrs. Meredith.

     "Would to Heaven it had been so; but I came to her assistance, and saw
him as he fled from my daughter's bedside, and I followed him to the roof, 
and
he was lost on your house, and your trap-door was open, and we presumed he
went in here."

     "The door was bolted when we went to bed last night," said Margaret.

     "Yes," responded her mother; "we always have that bolted every night, 
for
it is our only protection from that side of the house; but no one can be 
here;
we have no man in the house save our lodger, and invalid and quite a
gentleman."

     "Can we see him?"

     "I should think not, because he is an invalid; he's a colonel in the 
East
India service, and will, no doubt, be very angry at such a disturbance, and
much more so when he finds he is wanted.  I am really much shocked at this
disturbance, which is the more unfortunate as it is the first night he has
slept here."

     "I must see him."

     "Must, Mr. Smith-- must!  I cannot permit anything of the kind to be 
said
in my house.  I give you permission to look for him over the house, but I
can't give any such permission with what my lodgers possess-- it is not in 
my
power to do so if I had the inclination."

     While this was going on, the house had ben rummaged over and over, and
then a party of them, with Mr. Smith, came to the colonel's bedroom; a close
travelling cap and a dressing-gown were found on the mat before the door.

     "Oh!" said Mr. Smith, as he picked it up, "this appears very much like
what I saw the figure was dressed up in-- something like robes, and this 
would
serve the purpose."

     "Ah!" said the watchman, "we shall have him now."

     "But the gentleman is an invalid; he can hardly walk up stairs, much 
less
can he be scrambling over house-tops," said Mrs. Meredith.  "You must surely
all have been dreaming.  Something has disagreed with you, and the result 
has
been visions of which you can of course find no trace."

     "Not quite that, either," said one of the watchmen, "for we saw him
getting away, and he made for your trap-door, where I missed him.  I could 
not
see any more of him among the chimneys, or something of that sort, but I
thought he came in here, and found your door open."

     "And you saw him come in?" said Mrs. Meredith.

     "I can't say I saw him come in," said the man; "I couldn't see through 
a
brick-wall and a stack of chimneys which were in the way, but I felt certain
he must have come in here."

     "Well, this is very strange-- very singular."

     "The dressing-gown, too," said Mr. Smith, "is dusty and dirty all over-
-
at least in places where it appears to have come in contact with anything
dirty-- possibly the roof of the house; certainly something of that sort has
happened.  It looks very much like it."

     "And the cap sits close to the head; that is dirty."

     "But it is dry dirt," said Mr. Smith, "and of the same character; we 
had
better see this lodger of yours, Mrs. Meredith, and with your permission I
will knock."

     As Mr. Smith spoke he gave two or three loud knocks at the door, which
were not answered for some time.  But they were speedily repeated, and then 
a
peremptory voice exclaimed, --

     "In the name of goodness, what is the meaning of all this disturbance?
Is the house broken into, or is it a resort for thieves?  Be it as it may, 
if
I am disturbed in this way, and you don't instantly get out of the way and
make less noise, I'll fire through the door.  I have loaded pistols by my
side, and I will not submit to this shameful disturbance."

     A the sound of these words, the two watchmen were much disturbed, and
immediately stepped back so hastily as nearly to overthrow Mrs. Meredith and
her daughter; but Mr. Smith, after a step or two backwards, resumed his 
place
by the door, and exlaimed, --

     "I have not come here, sir, to be frightened; some strange 
circumstances
have just happened, and I must beg you'll open your door to explain them."

     "And who the devil are you?"

     "My name is Smith, sir.  I live next door, and my daughter has been
attacked by a vampyre.  I know not what nature the creature must possess, 
but
it has shocking propensities-- there are evidences at your door which make 
it
appear he has got into your room."

     "It would be very foolish in him to so anything of the sort," said the
colonel, "for, in the first place, I will not suffer annoyance in any shape;
and besides, I have loaded pistols for his reception.  Wait till I am 
dressed,
and then I will come out to you."

     "I am sure the colonel will be very much offended by this conduct, 
which
is very shameful; people's houses broken open and entered in this manner, 
and
peoples's rest broken so.  I am quite ashamed of my neighbours-- quite."

     "Really we have strong suspicions-- strong grounds of suspicion, too,
against that lodger of yours; look at that dressing-gown and cap, the open
trap-door, and all-- really I can't help thinking there is something very
suspicious in all this."

     "Yes, said the watchman; "I know there's nobody else in the house.  
I've
been all over it, and it's very strange to me if he ain't the man."

     "Well," said Margaret Meredith, "it seems as if you are most willing to
accuse those who are quite incapable of doing what you accuse them of.  This
gentleman was barely able to get up stairs without assistance; besides, he
could not have gone up stairs without some one being awoke by the noise.  
It's
my opinion that it is a piece of impertinence altogether."

     "So I think, my dear," said Mrs. Meredith.

     "I am a father, Mrs. Meredith," said Mr. Smith, "and I have my 
daughter's
safety and happiness at heart.  I am sure there's much, too, very 
suspicious.
You wouldn't like your daughter's blood sucked out of her arms.  I amd sure 
I
don't, nor does she."

     "Oh, botheration!" said Margaret; "who ever heard of such stuff?  I'm
sure I never did, except in some book of improbabilities, and nothing more;
but here is Colonel Deverill."

     At that moment Colonel Deverill opened the door, and then retired a
little into his room, saying as he did so, in a very angry voice, but, at 
the
same time, endeavouring to be courteous, --

     "You can come in, now; but I am quite at a loss to understand the 
nature
of this disturbance;  the house don't appear to be on fire; and that is the
only contingency in my mind that will justify such a disturbance.  What is 
the
matter, Mrs. Meredith?"

     "I can hardly tell you, sir.  I have been disturbed by finding a party 
of
people in my house; it is most amazing to me how they came in."

     "I will tell you, sir," said Mr. Smith.  "My daughter has been 
terrified
by the appearance of some one in her bed-room, who attempted to suck her 
blood
from the veins of her arm.  I don't know what to say about it."

     "I am sure I don't," said Colonel Deverill; "but I must say it's a most
unpleasant affair for those who have nothing to do with it.  It is a pity 
your
domestic afflictions should call you out in this manner; take my advice, 
sir;
go home, else you'll catch cold."

     "You may repent making a jest of this----"

     "I never repent anything, sir.  I regret I am so unnecessarily 
disturbed;
and it appears to me, your intrusion here is most unwarrantable."

     "Is this your dressing-gown, sir?"

     "Yes, it is."

     "Well, then, how did it come here, and in this state?" inquired Mr.
Smith, triumphantly.

     "I don't know-- I didn't put it there; but I suppose it must have 
fallen
accidentally; it would not have been thrown there willingly," said the
colonel, deliberately.

     "Well, I don't know," said Mr. Smith, "but it strikes me you've been on
the tiles this evening."

     "My good sir, if you don't leave my apartment, it may happen I may 
forget
my pains and lameness, and fling you out of the window.  If this had 
happened
in India instead of here, you would have had a particularly sharp knife
inserted between your ribs, or have been thrown into a well.  But I know
nothing, of this matter, which appears so strange, as to be beyond all 
reason;
neither experience nor common sense at all throw any light upon the matter; 
be
advised, sir, and retire, and allow honest people and invalids to sleep the
night out."

     Mr. Smith looked very blank, and, unable to comprehend all that had
passed, he could not tell what to think; he could not urge the matter 
further,
for he was met by real contempt and perfect self-assurance on the part of 
the
colonel, who moved about the room very lame, while his hand was in a sling,
and a green shade was placed over his eyes.

     "You see," said Mrs. Meredith, "you must be very entirely mistaken.
Colonel Deverill, we are sure, is quite unable to run about over house-tops,
even had he the inclination to do so, which is really absurd.  It must be at
least a great mistake on your part."

     "Yes, I am sure, too, Colonel Deverill could not have left the house
without our knowing it; indeed, it is a very silly affair, and has been a
great nuisance, to say the least of it.  I wonder Mr. Smith doesn't know
better than to break into peaceable people's houses."

     "But I did not do so."

     "How came you here, then?"

     "I followed some one else; the place was open; and yet you say it was
shut at night, and you usually kept it so.  How do you account for that?"

     "I cannot do so, unless some neglect took place, or else you must have
forced it open."

     "Oh, no, ma'am," said the watchman; "I can swear Muster Smith didn't do
that; it was open, and I found it so, so there's that to be accounted for; 
and
then there's the togs a lying outside here, that's to be accounted for; so,
you see, it's a werry suspicious case."

     "You are a very stupid fellow," said the colonel, "a very idiot, if you
imagine people are to be held responsible because a dressing-gown happens to
fall down.  I do not know but I shall proceed with this matter myself; it
seems to me you have committed a trespass, to say the least of it.  I can
pledge my word, as a man of honour and a soldier, I have not left my room;
indeed, these ladies know I could not do so; and their testimony would be
ample in a court of justice, and to a gentleman."

     "Yes, that is no more than the truth," said Mrs. Meredith, who was by 
no
means pleased with the disturbance; and because she had no sympathy for the
young lady who sat in the balcony to the annoyance of herself and daughter.

     "And I can bear witness to the same," said Miss Meredith.  "I think it 
is
quite time Mr. Smith returned to his own place, and see what is the matter
there; perhaps the person he saw may have passed him, and gone back again 
into
his own house."

     Mr. Smith lingered, looked wistfully, as if his doubts were not cleared
off; but yet the testimony was so clear and so strong, that he could not
dispute it; and, however unwillingly he was compelled to acknowledge, there
were some matters that he could not dispute, though he was unable to solve
them; and he and those with him returned from their unsatisfactory search.

 Next Week: A Breakfast Scene. -- A Match-Making Mother.




                                CHAPTER CXXX.

A BREAKFAST SCENE. -- A MATCH-MAKING MOTHER.


     The next day there was some anxiety on the part of Mrs. Meredith, to
ascertain how far her new lodger might have been disturbed by this event; 
and
in what temper of mind he felt upon the occasion.  It is usual in all 
lodgings,
to have some little regard to the lodger's comforts for some days, perhaps a
week or two, and then things are allowed to take their chance; and if the
lodger complains, he gets for an answer, that they take a vast deal of  
pains
to oblige him, and intimate that he is a peculiarly lucky man for having
become a lodger at that place; and you would have been worse off if you had
gone elsewhere, which, of course, you don't believe, though they tell you 
so.

     It is an old and favourite saying, that a new broom sweeps clean; and, 
in
time, an old one becomes very nearly useless.  So it is with lodging-house
keepers; the longer you remain, the more inattentive they become, until you
get wearied, and are compelled to leave, and then you get some scurvy
insolence, and your landlady eventually believes she is an ill-used woman.

     But, in the present instance, Mrs. Meredith had other hopes and fears
than those of a mere lodging-house keeper.  Not that she had formed any plan
in her own mind; but she had some floating idea that there was seldom such a
chance turned up, because the colonel had evidently no relations; and who
could tell what, in the chapter of accidents, might happen?

     "I am quite grieved," she said to her daughter, "it should have 
happened
this night.  What could be the meaning of the disturbance, I can't think.
Now, it's very tiresome things will happen so cross as this, that I don't 
know
what to think of it."

     "It really appears as if it was done on purpose."

     "It does; but I am sorry for it, because it would seem as though we 
were
liable to some kind of interruption at all times, for they generally expect
attention at the first, if at no other time; and he may think this is a bad
beginning, at all events."

     "But we shall convince him that we shall not treat him neglectfully,
ma'."

     "No, my dear; but these Indians are strange-tempered people, and when
they once take a fancy, there is no knowing what they may do; and there is 
no
knowing what a dislike taken at such an occurence might produce, and likes 
and
dislikes are taken without rhyme or reason."

     "Yes, ma', so they are; and that is the reason why you took such a
dislike to young Willis, for he was as nice a young man as I have seen."

     "Nice, my dear-- nice!  I don't see why he was nice, unless it was
because he was presumptuous, and had no money," said the amiable parent.

     "He was not rich, ma' ----"

     "He was positively poor, Margaret," interrupted the mother, "and
therefore it was absolutely necessary to discourage such persons; for, if 
they
do no good, they are sure to be productive of mischief; for their hanging
about, you know, deters others from coming forward who have means."

     "He was very handsome."

     "'Handsome is as handsome does,' my dear.  You'll find that is a motto
through life, that will carry weight at any time.  All the good looks in the
world would never put a gown on your back, or a sixpence in your purse,
recollect; besides, he was not handsome."

     "You are prejudiced against the young man.  Not that I care anything
about him, though he was a very agreeable and nice young man; so it's no use
in saying that he wasn't."

     "Well, my dear, it doesn't much matter; this is a matter of opinion.
What do you think of our colonel?  He is a fine man, and a rich one 
besides."

     "He is tall, I admit, but stoops a great deal;  is very lame; one eye
much worse than the other, and one arm in a sling.  Well, I can't see much
beauty in all that; much out of repair, you must admit, ma'."

     "Yes; Colonel Deverill has seen some service, and his misfortunes are 
so
many points of honour; they are like so many medals which speak of his 
worth.
Besides that, he is a most gentlemanly and pleasant man.  I don't know that 
I
ever spoke to a more fascinating man."

     "That might be at times; but then that was evidently a constraint upon
his natural temper, because he every now and then broke out abruptly about
something or other, which proves that he has an abrupt and imperious temper,
not to say savage and snappish."

     "There you are clearly unjustifiable, my dear Margaret.  The colonel, 
you
see, is a military man, and used to command, and therefore it is a very 
usual
occurrence, and not a matter of disposition at all; but what can that matter
when you come to consider his wealth?"

     "There is certainly room for congratulation there," said Margaret.

     "Indeed, my child, there is room for congratulation; and I am convinced
there is happiness where there is a fortune, for that will obtain all you
want, and, when you obtain all you want, what can you be otherwise than
entirely happy? -- therefore, riches are happiness."

     "Yes; there is much truth in all that, ma'," said Margaret; "and all I
hope is, that I might obtain a fortune; then I would make you comfortable,
ma'."

     "I am sure you would, Margaret.  My whole life has been spent in shifts
to maintain you and bring you up in a manner that would enable you to become 
a
fortune; which, thanks to my care, example, and precept, you are fully equal
to at any moment it may become your lot."

     "Yes, ma'; I feel that I was born to command, and the lady of a colonel
would not be a bit too high in rank for my ambition or deserts."

     "Indeed, it would not, my dear; but now listen to me.  You know, my 
dear,
I never plan anything but what is for your benefit.  Now, I am given to
understand that Colonel Deverill has no relatives at all, and I think hardly
any friends, and we can make ourselves quite necessary to him-- in fact,
perfect friends to him.  He will look upon us as his nearest relatives, and 
he
may take a fancy to you, as you may easily induce him.  Old men like 
flattery,
there is no doubt, and that kind of flattery which is called attention.  
Wait
upon him most assiduously, and read to him, and all that kind of thing, my
dear."

     "Yes; I know, ma'."

     "And then, dear, if you mind what you are about, the colonel and all 
his
wealth may be yours before six months are over, or I am no witch."

     "Hush!  I hear him stirring."

     "He's coming down stairs; there he is in the drawing-room; I hear him
over head.  Go up stairs, my dear, and inquire when he will choose to have 
his
breakfast."

     "Yes, ma'," said the young lady, who betrayed an extraordinary desire 
to
obey her parent, a matter not equally to be said of all young ladies, nor of
this one upon many occasions; but, then, this was one that was quite 
agreeable
to her own feelings, which explains the secret.

     Colonel Deverill had, indeed, descended, and was seated in the
drawing-room, with his feet on the fender and his head leaning on his hand,
and his elbow on the table, when Margaret entered.  He appeared to be
thoughtful and unwell; he had, perhaps, passed a bad night, or the
interruption had robbed him of his sleep, which to an invalid was the more
severely felt.

     Good morning, colonel," said Margaret, advancing.  "I hope the
disturbance that so inopportunely took place, did not have the effect of
destroying your night's rest."

     "Indeed, it did do so to a very great extent," replied the colonel,
"though not entirely; but still it makes one very poorly, gives one the
headache, and causes a sense of lassitude and fatigue to oppress the body,
which, added to the weariness incident to such cases, makes one very
uncomfortable."

     "I am sorry you have been so discomposed, and so is my ma'.  She really
is grieved; but you see, sir, it was a matter so entirely beyond any 
control,
that she cannot be blamed for it, though it happened, most unfortunately, at 
a
time when it was least wanted, or most to be avoided."

     "True-- very true.  I can imagine all that.  I am not unjust enough to
blame you for it.  I could no more help it than you could, and I dare say 
you
were none the better for such a disagreeable disturbance; I am not, I am 
very
certain.

     "No, sir, I am not.  When would you please to breakfast?"

     "As soon as I can have it," replied the colonel.

     "You can have it at once."

     "Then be pleased to let me have it.  I have the use of but one arm
entirely; may I beg your aid in making tea for me?"

     "With pleasure, sir."

     Margaret immediately left the room, and informed her mother of what had
passed upon the occasion; and when the breakfast was laid, and all things
ready, Margaret Meredith sat down with Colonel Deverill to breakfast.  
Before,
however, they had gone far, he inquired if she had breakfasted.

     "No, I have not."

     "And your mother-- has she breakfasted?"

     "No, sir, she has not."

     "Then give her my compliments, and I shall be glad to take breakfast in
her company too; for I am very poorly this morning, and company is 
agreeable."

     This was soon effected, and in a few minutes more they all sat down, 
the
colonel being duly waited upon by Margaret and her mother; the latter being
employed in aiding the former to pay great attention to their host; for they
breakfasted at his expense, as a matter of course.

     "It was really a most unfortunate occurrence, that of last night," said
Mrs. Meredith; "very unfortunate; because some people have a difficulty in
sleeping in a strange bed; and when once awake, they cannot easily, if at 
all,
get asleep again, and that I had great fears might have been your case."

     "Not precisely," said the colonel; "but the fact is, I have seen so 
much
hard service, that I can sleep anywhere without any effort of mine; but when
one has suffered from wounds, the heats of climate, and the terrors of
imprisonments in Indian prisons, one's health becomes so shattered, that 
one's
rest is not so good as it ought to be-- but that is no one's fault."

     "It is a grievous misfortune," said Mrs. Meredith.

     "Yes," added Margaret; "and I think there is not enough gratitude in 
the
country towards those who so nobly defend us in our homes; to do which they
must not only brave danger and death in the field of battle, but all the 
evils
that spring from climate, insidious diseases, brought on by the expousures 
and
hardships of a soldier's life; and then when they see them return to their
own country, with wounds that ought to bring honour, glory, and sure profit,
they are omitted and neglected."

     The colonel sighed deeply, but said nothing.

     "My dear Miss Meredith, will you fetch me my keys? -- I left them in 
the
bureau."

     "Yes, sir," said the amiable young lady, who arose, and left the room.

     "Your daughter is an amiable girl, Mrs. Meredith," said Colonel 
Deverill. 
"She reminds me of one who is now dead, and at whose decease I left England
for India; the country became insupportable to me at that time, but she now
recalls all the feelings and aspirations of youth."

     "Ah! she is an amiable and good girl-- though I am her mother; yet I 
must
not do her less than justice, because it it is usual to consider it partial 
or
silly of a parent praising her own child; but she does deserve all that can 
be
said of her."

     "It is a blessing.  There was the same class of beauty, and the same
amiable and sensible deportment.  Oh, dear! those days are gone by, indeed!"

     "Who knows but they may return?"

     "It is doubtful; more than doubtful-- certain.  I am an old man, now,
Mrs. Meredith, -- an old man.  Yes; I have deserved some thanks at the hands
of my country; and I am rich-- yes, Mrs. Meredith, I am rich-- very rich, I
believe I may say."

     "That is some reward."

     "It is.  But I cannot recall the past-- I am no longer young-- I have 
no
young wife by my side-- to soothe my pillow-- to attend to my wants.  No; I 
am
an old man, as I said before, and cannot expect the attention of the young 
and
beautiful."

     "But, Colonel Deverill, you are not an old man; and as for your wounds,
they are honourable."

     "But my shattered constitution----"

     "May be mended by care and attention, doubtless; and I am sure, while 
you
are here, you shall want no attention we can possibly bestow."

     "I thank you, Mrs. Meredith-- I thank you," said the colonel.

     "I only regret the disturbance you suffered last night," said Mrs.
Meredith.  "I am afraid want of proper rest has made you melancholy.  I knew
not of such a thing, neither was I at all aware of the fact of the trap-door
being open-- indeed, I can't understand it."

     "Nor I, ma'am.  I do not clearly understand what they said; they talked
of some young lady being strangled or assaulted in in [sic] her sleep."

     "Yes, colonel.  It was in her sleep, and I cannot help thinking it must
have been a dream; however, if it were not, I do not know what to think of
it."

     "Nor I," said the colonel, thoughtfully.

     "They talked about a vampyre, and said Miss Smith had been seized by 
the
arm; and the creature had attempted to suck the blood from the veins."

     "Dear me, what a strange affair."

     "Very, sir; but I never heard of such things only in books; but, 
goodness
help us from such strange unearthly beings-- have you seen any in your
travels, Colonel Deverill?  You have travelled in hot countries, and have 
seen
them, I should imagine."

     "Not I, Mrs. Meredith; I have seen strange things, but I never saw a
vampyre, though I have heard of such things; indeed, there are many 
disgusting
things in creation, and that is one of them.  But what could be the reason
they should come to that young lady above any other, I cannot conceive."

     "Nor I, sir."

     At this moment Margaret returned, having recovered the keys, which were
not wanted; only the watchful mamma thought there was an opportunity for a
little tender gag relative to the amiability of the young lady, and,
therefore, it ought not to be omitted.

     Moreover, she saw there was no necessity for leaving them alone yet;
there would be plenty of time yet for that, and she felt assured there would
be ample opportunity for the progress of the suit she now confidently
anticipated must take place; for she saw, however prompt and ready the 
colonel
might be from habit, yet there was a good deal of the willing mood about 
him.

     "His health and weakness," she thought, "causes that; and now, while 
his
health lasts this way, he may be secured; or, at least, the foundation laid
upon which we may build our hopes.  He shall want no aid of mine to help him
on that way."

     "Have you been long in England, colonel?" she inquired.

     "Not very long."

     "The voyage homeward must have been very tedious."

     "It would have been, but I did not come that way.  I crossed into 
Egypt,
and came to the Mediterranean, and thence to Italy; so I varied the scene, 
and
travelled at leisure, and got here a month before the vessel I was to have
come by."

     "Oh, that was much more pleasant."

     "Decidedly so; and then I came to the hotel; not that I had not all
proper attention paid me-- but then there is no sociality there; men only
surround you with whom you can hold no converse whatever."

     "Certainly not, they are menials."

     "And of the lowest class.  However, I sought out such a place as this,
where I wished to have some of the domestic comforts around me, that I might
have had, had I a home of my own; some one to whom I could speak more
seriously; for I am debarred the affectionate regard of near and dear female
relatives."

     "You must look upon us in that light, Colonel Deverill; as persons who
are anxious and desirous of causing you to forget these wants by our 
assiduity
and attention.  I can speak for my daughter as myself; she will do all in 
her
power to render your stay comfortable."

     "She is young and beautiful."

     "Ahem!"

     "And doubtless will change such occupations to those of a more 
endearing
character.  Well, it is as it should be, and I am selfish to feel jealous.  
I
wish I was young myself-- but, enough of this.  I have to express my
obligation to you for the ready manner in which you came forward to speak of
my being in my room last night, when that man was here and the watchmen."

     "Mr. Smith?"

     "Yes, that was the man; they would not have taken my word for it;
however, I hope to be able to remain here until I find myself sinking to the
grave; and those who act as you have began to act for me, I must and will
remember at my death and afterwards."

     "I do not act with such a motive, Colonel Deverill."

     "No, no; I am well aware of that; but that renders it a duty in me.
However, we will say no more now; I am even wearied out."

                                     -+-

 Next Time: Mrs. Meredith's Friend. -- Exchange of Services, and Compact.




                               CHAPTER CXXXI.

MRS. MEREDITH'S FRIEND. -- EXCHANGE OF SERVICES, AND COMPACT.


     There could be no doubt in the minds of both mother and daughter that
there was something much resembling a moral certainty concerning the fate of
the reitred colonel.  That he must marry was evident -- he was to all 
intents
and purposes resolved to do so.  He talked of a home and domestic comfort, 
and
all that kind of thing; therefore it would be easy to entangle him in the
meshes of love; the snares of passion might be sucessfully set, and they 
would
be sure to be productive of some sport, and even a stray colonel might be
caught, one who, having had enough of the wars of man, might now be 
considered
to become a fair object of attack in those of Venus.

     However, there appeared much in the colonel's circumstances and
disposition that laid him open to the attacks of designing matrons and
maidens.  He seemed to appreciate female company -- was particularly well
pleased with female attentions; perhaps his health required their aid more
than that of any other; and he had evidently been in love, and lost the 
object
of his earliest affections.

     One great thing in Margaret Meredith's favour was, the colonel had 
taken
it into his head that she much resembled this lady, whoever she was; and 
this
fact, no doubt, had opened his heart towards her; and he felt a kindly, and
perhaps a warmer feeling, towards her.  This, they calculated, would greatly
assist them in their efforts to circumvent the colonel, and cause him to
capitulate upon matrimonial conditions.

     "There never was so good a chance," said Mrs. Meredith, in the course 
of
a day or two after the above scene; "there never was such a chance as the 
one
you now have."

     "What, with the colonel, ma'?"

     "Yes, my love, you may depend upon it, that is a very safe speculation.
Why, he must be immensely rich.  I am sure that some of the jewels I have 
seen
on his fingers must be worth thousands of pounds.  He is a very rich man,
there can be no doubt."

     "Yes, ma', he is very rich."

     "And you will have many fine things that you have never dreamed of.  
Why,
you will have a carriage; I should think he would never refuse you that
trifle."

     "He has not one now."

     "Yes, that is true; he would never use it himself; and that accounts 
for
it.  But when he has a wife it is quite another matter; and one which you 
can
easily manage when you are a wife; you can do more then than you can now. 
Besides, you'll see how the money is spent; and it must all go through your
hands, you know; that can't be helped."

     "No, I dare say not; but, ma' don't you think, when he dies, there will
be a loss of the pension? and that would be a serious loss."

     "It would; but then you will have a pension as an officer's widow,
besides all his vast property, without any trouble whatever-- with nobody to
contradict you; that is, if he were to die; but I think he will not do that;
he does not, at times, appear so old as one would think; and yet, he is very
pale; but that, I suppose, is caused by his long residence abroad in hot
climates, and being exposed to the weather of all kinds, attended by wounds
and sickness.' [sic]

     "No doubt he has suffered much; but he has obtained a handsome fortune,
which pays for a great deal, you know, said Margaret.

     "Undoubtedly, by dear; by-the-bye, have you heard how that affair of 
Miss
Smith was ended, and why they came in here in such a manner?"

     "Oh, it was a very shocking affair; there were some marks in her arm,
which I cannot understand; it does seem very extraordinary to me, but she 
says
she was awoke in the night by some monster sucking her blood."

     "Dear me! who ever heard of such nonsense?"

     "I cannot but think there must have been something in it; and, yet, 
what
could have been the reason for them all to utter a falsehood, I don't know.
There was, you know, the father, then the watchmen, all of whom said they 
saw
it; at all events, they appeared to have some idea that it must have been 
done
by some one in our house; the dressing gown and that appeared to bewilder
them."

     "Did they say they thought so still." [sic]

     "No; they did not do that, we spoke spoke [sic] so positive; and I saw
when I went in to see her, she was much terrified at what had occurred, and
could not get up; she had a physician to attend her, who will not hear of
anything that she says."

     "Well, I think he is right."

     "But the whole family appear to side with her, and insist that it was 
no
robber who made the attempt; for nothing was gone, nothing was attempted in
the shape of robbery; nothing was touched nor moved; therefore, there could 
be
no common motive, they said.  Well, at all events, they have made somebody
very disagreeable in the family, and they had better have been quiet, but 
they
are a disagreeable set, and I shall not go in again."

     "You are right; my dear; they would be glad to push that minx of theirs
in here, and get an acquaintance with the colonel.  No, it will be safest to
keep them apart; we will have as few female visitors, my dear, as possible;
not that I think you run any chance of rivalry, but, you know, men are such
uncertain things."

     "To be sure they are, ma'." replied Margaret.

     "Well, then, if we have no female acquiantances, you see we cannot
possibly run any risk, and the matter will not be so protracted, because
everything depends upon things being smooth and uninterrupted; he will be 
the
more ready to propose and push the matter to a point."

     "Do you think him a likely man, ma', to marry?"

     "Certain of it, my dear, quite certain of it.  I know a marrying man as
soon as I see him; the colonel is decidedly a marrying man, he talks of 
home,
domestic comfort, and all that kind of thing; and when men do that, you may 
be
sure, if you are cautious, to catch such an one."

     "Well, I will try."

     "Do, my dear; it will be worth your while, it will make all our 
fortunes.
I wonder what his money is invested in."

     "I should like to know that," said Margaret.

     "And so should I.  Do you know, I have been thinking of that myself 
more
than once.  It will be necessary to find it out, and yet it is so delicate a
matter, that I think you had better make no attempt to work it out of him.
Let the affair take its own course at present."

     "But I can hear all."

     "Then you will act wisely, my dear, very wisely, prudently; but do no
more-- hear and see all, and say nothing-- of course, I mean upon that 
subject
alone.  Now, if we proceed cautiously, we shall be sure to gain our object; 
I
will take some method of obtaining the information I want at some future 
time,
because it will be well to have him caught before we begin to pull tight the
line; or, at least, before we begin to make any inquiries respecting his 
means
he must give us some caue to do so."

     "I dare say we shall know something by accident some of these days;
perhaps, at the hotel where he comes from, something may be learned by
inquiry."

     "Possibly there may, my dear; but I do not like to go there.  At all
events, they can know but little, for he has not been long in England, and
would hold but little communication with such people.  We must have some
better plan than that to go upon, else we shall never be successful, except 
at
the cost of some cross in our hopes we would rather have avoided."

     "Well, ma', you shall do as you like in this affair.  I am sure you 
will
do what is right and best for the occasion; besides, one plan is better than
two."

     "You are right, my dear.  I am, however, resolved to have a visitor."

     "A visitor, ma'?"

     "Yes, my dear; only Mr. Twissel, the attorney."

     "Oh, I know who you mean now; but why do you have him?  He is a very
funny sort of an acquaintance, especially if he is to meet the colonel."

     "I wish him to meet him, my dear, for that reason.  He will be able to
get out of him, by some means, what he has got his money locked up in.  A 
hint
will serve him, and he can make inquiries, and learn it all, and then he 
will,
if we are successful, have a good thing of marriage settlements, and so 
forth.
Besides, I will make an agreeement with him that he shall have a sum of 
money
for his trouble."

     "That will be a very good plan, certainly."

     "Exactly, and you needn't be seen in it at all; so I think we shall be
all very fairly put in the way of doing well.  I shall go out this morning,
and call upon Mr. Twissel, and have some conversation with him.  He used to
have some business of your father's to do, and has had much of his money, as
well as a good word now and then."

     "Dear me, who is that?  There is a double knock at the door, ma'.  How
vexing it will be to have any one come here.  I shall hate the sight of any
one coming in now."

     "Can't you see from the window who it is, my dear?"

     "No, ma'."

     "Then we must wait until the servant comes in."

     The words had hardly been uttered, before the servant entered, and said
that Mr. Twissel wanted to speak to Mrs. Meredith, if she was at home.

     "God bless me! -- send him in," said Mrs. Meredity, after the first
surprise was over; and then, turning to her daughter, she said, "Talk of
what's-his-name, and you are sure to see some of his friends.  If I had 
wanted
him to come, he would not have been here."

     "Very likely, ma'; and yet you do, and he is here."

     At this moment Mr. Twissel made his appearance, and entered the 
parlour. 
Having saluted the ladies, he proceeded to lay his hat and cane on the 
table,
saying, --

     "Mrs. Meredith, I dare say you are surprised to see me, after so long 
an
absence."

     "My surprise is not greater than my pleasure, Mr. Twissel.  I am very
glad to see an old friend of my husband's.  Pray sit down, sir."

     "Thank you, I will.  I am glad to see you look so well.  I need not ask
how you are, and your amiable daughter too; she appears charming."

     "Yes, Mr. Twissel, we are in tolerable good health; not often better."

     "Do not let me disturb you, Miss Margaret," said Mr. Twissel, as she 
rose
to leave the room.

     "Oh, no, sir, not at all.  I have something to attend to, if you will
excuse me."

     "Certainly, certainly.  I hope I shall not be any cause of putting you 
to
any constraint and inconvenience; at the same time, I shall ot detain Mrs.
Meredith long."

     "Oh, we don't intend to lose you suddenly," said Mrs. Meredith.
"Anything I can oblige you in I shall be very happy to do so, if you point 
out
the how."

     "Then I will proceed to do so at once," said Mr. Twissel; "I will do so
at once.  You see, when your late husband died, or before, he gave me 
several
debts to collect."

     "So I understood," said Mrs. Meredith.

     "Exactly; I see you understand me.  Now, those debts I was to collect
myself for my own benefit, he having, when he died, owed me a considerable 
sum
of money.  He assigned them to me, and I accepted them as payment of his 
debt
due to me."

     "I understood such to be the case, and at that point the matter was
considered as settled; was it not, Mr. Twissel?" said Mrs. Meredith.

     "It was so, and is so now, as far as I know now; but I want some few
papers which it is possible may be somewhere in your possession, to enable 
me
to secure the payment of them; and without those papers I shall not be able 
to
enforce attention.  Now, I want to know if you will oblige me with them if 
you
have them by you?"

     "I will certainly look and make any search I can for them, and if I 
find
them you shall have them, certainly.  But, now I have disposed of that, will
you do me a favour?"

     "Certainly, with pleasure."

     "Well, then, Mr. Twissel, you see, there is a certain rich lodger of 
mine
who pays certain attentions to my daughter Margaret," said Mrs. Meredith.

     "I see," said Mr. Twissel.

     "Well, then, he had made no positive offer yet; but we have certain
expectations, you see, and in case those expectations become realized, I 
want
to be in such a situation as to know at once what I shall do in such a case-
-
what ought to be done."

     "Very good, my dear madam;  very good."

     "Now, we only know from report, and from appearances, that he is rich; 
we
feel quite convinced of that-- he could not well be otherwise," said Mrs.
Meredith; "but we are anxious to know in what kind of stock or property he 
is
likely to have invested it."

     "Yes, I see.  Well, then, all you have to do is to learn what you can
from himself or his friends, and then make inquiries respecting the truth of
what you hear.  I should be very happy in assisting to make such inquiries, 
or
in any way you may point out."

     "I am very much obliged to you; but, Mr. Twissel, it is a very delicate
subject for females to touch upon, and, moreover, it is worse, considering 
how
my daughter is likely to be in connection with him."

     "It is a delicate matter, certainly."

     "Well, now, what I wanted was this; if you would on some occasion-- I
would let you know beforehand, -- call in and take some tea, or whatever 
meal
happened to be at hand, and get into conversation with the colonel, and get
this matter from him---"

     "Oh, he is a colonel in the army, then?"

     "Yes; but returned, in bad health, from the Indies.  He has come only
recently."

     "Aye, aye, I see; you have a nabob, I see.  That will be a very 
handsome
settlement for your daughter, my dear madam; a very handsome settlement."

     "Yes, it will."

     "Well, it is handsome; but there are drawbacks, you see."

     "Oh, age, and ill health."

     "Exactly; they are drawbacks, you see, that are not always to a young
female's taste."

     "No, no; but, then, my daughter is a reasonable young woman, Mr. 
Twissel,
and would not object to a good fortune because there was a kind, though,
perhaps, elderly, gentleman for a husband.  Oh, dear, no, sir, I have no
apprehensions of that character; she will be good and obedient, especially
when she knows that it is all for her good; besides that, you see, the
colonel, though an invalid, is not so very old, and is a most pleasant, and, 
I
might say, fascinating gentleman to converse with; so that she can have no
personal objection; and, besides, from what I can observe, I have reason to
believe that the colonel is by no means disagreeable to her."

     "Then I am sure it is a very handsome prospect for her, and one that
might have been long in happening to one who had a better fortune to aid 
her."

     "Yes, indeed, it might."

     "Well, then, if I can aid you, command my services."

     "In this respect you may do me much good, but I do not, as it will be
some little loss of time to you, desire you should do so for nothing.  If we
succeed, and all is comfortable, you shall have a hundred pounds soon after
the marriage-- say three months."

     "Very well.  I am quite willing to accept the terms, and should I be
wanted at any time, perhaps you will let me know as long before as 
possible."

     "I will do so."

     "And then, when I next come, perhaps you'll be able to hand me the
papers, and be ready to sign some agreement which I will get ready for the
purpose."

     "Very well, I will do it."

     "I am much obliged to you," said Mr. Twissel; "however, I suppose, when 
I
am introduced to the colonel, I am only to come in as an old friend of the
family?"

     "Exactly so; that will be by far the best character to assume, because
you may be anything; besides which, when matters come to a point proper for
interference, you can do so the more easily, and with more effect, and he 
also
will be less inclined to quarrel; and at the same time he can have less
objection to do so, which, you see, is a little better."

     "I see," said the attorney, rising; "and now, as we have settled this
business so far, I will bid you good afternoon, as I have some business
elsewhere this evening, which I must get finished."

     After exchanging greetings, the attorney quitted the house of Mrs.
Meredith without further remark.

 Next Time: Volume III: The Explanation, and the Proposal. -- A Tete-a-Tete.




                               CHAPTER CXXXII.

THE EXPLANATION, AND THE PROPOSAL. -- A TETE-A-TETE.


     A week or more had passed away since the visit of the attorney to Mrs.
Meredith, and yet the latter saw not a sufficient reason why she should send
for her friend.  Things were not ripe yet; the colonel had, it was true, 
been
melting gradually; but then to progress ever so little, was a great point in
anything -- no matter what it is -- something gained.

     Mrs. Meredith, however, by no means lost sight of her object; she had
that steadily in view, and worked for it every day; and her daughter was no
less assiduous -- she was attentive and humble, waited upon Colonel Deverill
with the affectionate assiduity of a daughter; while, on his part, he sighed
and said, what a happy man he must be, who should have her for a wife.

     It was arranged one day, when he appeared to be more than usually 
tender,
that the mother should be out that evening, and see some of her friends, and
break the news a little to some of them; a pardonable vanity in the lady, 
for
it was not in accordance with her position in society that her daughter 
could
expect such an offer as the one she daily expected.

     The lady did as she had agreed, and left the house, while Margaret went
to the colonel's sitting-room when his bell rang, and hoped he'd excuse the
absence of her mother, as she had gone out to see some friends whom she had
not seen for some time.

     "I am happy i having you attend to me, Miss Margaret.  I cannot be
attended to better.  I am afraid, as it is, I am a terrible annoyance to 
you."

     "Annoyance, colonel! far from it-- very far from it; and I do hope you 
do
not mean what you say, else I shall fear I have unwillingly given you some
cause for your opinion, which I shall the more regret, as you are yourself
so kind.  I assure you it gives me great pleasure when I know I can do aught
to alleviate the misfortunes, or satisfy the wishes of any of my friends."

     "And do you reckon me one, Miss Margaret?"

     "I hope Colonel Deverill will not consider me too presumptuous in 
looking
upon him as something more than a mere casual friend or acquaintance."

     "Casual acquaintance, Miss Margaret-- casual acquaintance!"

     "Well, friendship, if you allow me to say so."

     "Friendship!" repeated the colonel, with a deep drawn sigh; "I would I
could claim a yet warmer title than a friend.  I could then hope for some of
those pleasures which are denied a solitary man like me-- I should then have
those whom I loved to soothe my death-bed, and whom I could benefit by 
worldly
wealth, could I, Margaret, think I could claim a feeling stronger than that 
of
friendship."

     "Oh! Colonel Deverill, how can you talk in this strain?  Indeed, you--
you are too good-- dear me, I do not know what I was about to say."

     "Miss Meredith," said the colonel, taking her hand with gentleness, and
tenderly pressing it, "I am seen to a great disadvantage; I have been many
years fighting for my country, and I have not had time to cultivate those
sweet and tender emotions such as I feel at this moment."

     "Yes, you must have suffered much," said Margaret.

     "And now, when I return again, I am somewhat the worse in appearance; 
but
my heart is as warm as ever it was, and I am more than ever alive to the 
charm
of female society.  It is that unreserved interchange of thought and good
offices which attaches me to life, and makes me live even with hope.  Do not
dispel this day-dream of mine, Margaret."

     The colonel paused and pressed her hand to his lips, while she appeared
confused and irresolute, and was unable to withdraw her hand from his, but 
at
length she sank tremblng into a chair.

     "My charming creature, may I suppose this emotion is caused by excess 
of
feeling-- that-- that-- in short, I am not wholly indifferent to you?"

     "Oh, colonel!  I'm really unable to speak!"

     "My beloved girl, I am loved; yes, I see it-- oh, happiness!"

     Midst these broken sentences,the colonel contried to slip his hand 
round
the young lady's waist, and he pressed her close to him.  For a moment she
forgot his proximity, and remained passive; but suddenly and quietly
disengaging herself, she said, --

     "Pardon, me, Colonel Deverill; I had forgotton-- I was unconscious-- a
weakness came over me, and---"

     "You love me!"

     "If you have become acquainted with that which was a secret, sir, you
must use it as such; but you must not talk in this strain to me; promise me,
colonel, and-- and-- I will see about the tea immediately."

     "May I speak to your mother?"

     "Colonel Deverill can do as he pleases.  I have no secrets from my dear
mamma."

     "I will-- I will, and Heaven bless you for saying so much.  I may say 
you
ar not averse to me, and that, with her consent, I shall not despair."

     "We will say no more, Colonel Deverill," said the cautious maiden.

     "You shall command me-- you are the arbitress of my fate," said the
colonel, who had become warmer and eulogistic to a degree.

     Much more, however, passed between them; the ice was broken, and they
conversed more freely; for when they began the tea, much was said that did 
not
partake of so warm a character as that which had already passed; but it,
nevertheless, partook of the same purpose.

     "When I am married," said the colonel, "I should like a carriage.  I 
have
no use for one now, as I could but very seldom ride; but when I had a wife,
then I should wish for her accommodation as well as my own; but which do you
prefer, country or town life?"

     "There is much of comfort and quiet in a country life,: said Margaret;
"and yet I am not entirely wedded to country life-- there is much of 
pleasure
in London."

     "So there is; and where you have no resources of your own, or in your 
own
house, it is preferable; but when such is the case, London loses all its
charms, or a great part of them."

     "So it does," said Margaret.

     "However, I am partial to both.  I should like a partial town and 
country
life."

     "That, indeed, would be the very greatest delight one could experience;
to live sometimes in one place, and sometimes in another."

     "So it would."

     "By the way, if we kept a carriage, which I would do," said the 
colonel,
after a pause, "it would be a very excellent thing to enable us to travel
about in."

     "Perhaps you have been to some parts, and like them better than 
others."

     "Yes, I have been to a good many parts; but I cannot at this moment 
speak
of them; but we would look out for some place that would be more agreeable
than others."

     "Perhaps you have some place of your own you would like to live in?"

     "No, -- not exactly; these things are not of one's own choice, and not
empty; and, therefore, are useless as residences."

     "Certainly.  Besides, you must be near enough to come to town for
business purposes."

     "Yes, I must, but that needn't be often," replied the colonel; "but 
where
there is plenty of means, there is no fear of not getting what we want."

     "No, indeed, there is not."

     "And one thing alone would repay me for the hardships I have endured, 
the
misery I have suffered, and the misfortunes I have experienced in all my
marchings and counter-marchings; my sleeping in the open air by night, and
scorched by the sun by day."

     "And what may that be, colonel?"

     "Why, the power it gives me of conferring happiness and wealth upon 
you;
for, in the natural course of events, you will outlive me."

     "Oh, for mercy's sake, don't talk of that, sir."

     "But it is a matter that I can think of calmly enough; and, as a 
soldier,
I have ample occasion, I can assure you."

     "Indeed!  I dare say you must have."

     "I can remember, on one occasion, especially, which I will relate to 
you,
if I do not weary," said Colonel Deverill.

     "On, no-- no!  I cannot be weary," said Margaret.

     "Then I will tell you.  I was ordered to march some troops to attack 
the
stockade of Puttythempoor, a very strong place."

     "Was it a town?"

     "No, merely a place of strength, where the enemy had gathered together 
in
great numbers; and here we were determined to attack them.  The stockade was 
a
very strong place; and there were strong and high timber fences, with large
mounds of earth and bags of sand, all tending to make the place one of great
strength," said the colonel.

     "What a place it must have been!"

     "Yes; it was very strong.  Well, my party did not amount to more than
fifteen hundred men strong, while the enemy, with the advantages of the
defence, were more than three thousand, giving them a vast superiority over
us; but we were not to be daunted by that; we were determined to make a 
dash,
and, from the character of the men I commanded, I had no fear of the result. 
We were sure to make our way among them, and then we were sure of the 
result."

     "How dreadful!"

     "Well, the men were divided into three bodies-- five hundred each-- and
these into divisions of one hundred each, the one to support the other.  We
had no guns, and were therefore compelled to depend entirely upon our luck 
in
the assault."

     "Goodness me! I wonder how you could think of it with anything like 
case
or comfort.  It would make me all of a freeze!"

     "Oh, Margaret! when the soldier is in the field of battle, he must get
the better of all feelings, save those of honour."

     "It is too true!" said Margaret, with a sigh.

     "And then," said Colonel Deverill, "we, having arranged our plans, and
settled who was to take the command, if I had the mischance to fall---"

     "Good Heavens!"

     "Well, I say, having done all this, we were resolved to make a dash at
the point, and take the place by assault.  To do this the more effectually, 
we
were resolved to make the attempt in three different places at once, so as 
to
divert the enemy's attention, and to place them in a cross fire, and thus 
take
them the more easily.

     "This plan was carried out to the letter, and we made the attack; but 
the
enemy defended their stockade so vigorously, and what with the strength of 
the
place, and the determination of the enemy, we were for some time repulsed-- 
at
least, held at bay.

     "This would never do, I thought.  I must mount the breach myself; for, 
if
my division was held at bay, I had fears of the rest; they might meet 
repulses
also, which would occasion the loss of our whole party, which would have 
been
sure destruction; not defeat alone, but imprisionment, and possibly death 
from
ill-usage, or from malignant disorders."

     "What fearful scenes!"

     "I ordered my men to keep close and follow me.  We made a dash at the
stockade three abreast, and up we went.  By Jove, it was fine work-- a brave
sight-- a sight I can never forget while I have remembrance left me.  We got
up the stockade Heaven knows how, and were over it in the space of a minute;
but the impetuosity of those who came first was not seconded by those who 
came
after; it was easy enough to get down among the Indians, but it was very 
hard
to get up; and while our friends were getting up, we were exposed to the
strength of hundreds-- only four men to as many hundreds for several 
minutes."

     "Goodness, how dreadful!  Were you not all killed?"

     "Except for myself, they were all killed.  Each received a dozen 
wounds,
and I should have met with the same fate, but for an Indian officer, who,
seeing me surrounded and thrown down, saved my life from the fury of his 
men;
but, in a minute after, I was free-- my own men came down by dozens, and the
blacks wre swept off by the hundred.

     "At that moment, too, there were our other parties just appearing over
the other parts of the stockade, so we had now plenty of assistance.

     "The blacks now on all sides fell in numbers before the fire, and the
place was our own; and a hearty cheer was given that made the woods re-echo
again."

     "Were you not glad the danger was over?"

     "The danger was not over, though we thought it was; for suddenly the
earth heaved up with a tremendous explosion, and many of our poor fellows 
were
blown up into the air, and I myself was completely knocked over and 
smothered
in dirt; however, it was dry, and we were soon put to rights again.  I was
picked up, and nothing more happened."

     "What was the cause of your disaster?"

     "Oh, a mine the scamps had sprung as they were retiring, hoping to do 
us
more mischief than they did; however, we beat them off, and they lost many 
men
on that occasion, and did not show themselves again, but made the best of
their way through the woods and jungle by some paths that we did not know, 
and
hence we did not follow them further."

     "It must have been dreadfully dangerous."

     "Yes, life was the game we played for, and it was won and lost often
enough, during that war; but we must expect it should be so.["]

     "But you are now safe."

     "Yes, I am now safe, and, I may say, happy.  I have had some knocks, 
and
am none the better for them bodily; but then I have had them well paid for, 
so
I must not complain.  I have now but one object to attain before I die."

     "And what may that be, colonel, if it be no secret?"

     "It is not to you, Miss Meredith," said the colonel; "it is an early
day-- a day on which I may claim you as my own; then, indeed, I shall have
lived and accomplished something; an object worth living for, and, may I say
so, worth dying for."

     "Ah, I hope you may live many years yet, colonel-- many years of life 
and
happiness, to enjoy the fortune you have so gallantly won.  Indeed, I think 
no
fortune ought to give so much joy as the soldier's."

     "And why, Miss Meredith?"

     "Because there is none so arduously won; won often with bloodshed, and
even life; it ought, indeed, to give great and lasting happiness."

     "If I obtain my wishes, I shall be the happiest man in the universe; 
and
I would go through all I have gone through over-- aye, twice over, and that 
is
no little-- to have such a reward as the one I now seek-- it is the crowning
happiness of my life."

     "You are very kind to say all this---"

     "Aye, but I mean it.  It is no common compliment," said the colonel; "I
mean what I say, most earnestly.  Do you believe what I say?  I am not used 
to
the pretty speeches of young men who make love-- perhaps I ought; but I am 
an
old soldier, and am but little used to these ways; however, I have spoken my
mind, and I hope you will not allow any one else to injure my cause."

     "Anything you have said, Colonel Deverill, has been of too serious a
nature for me to think of anything save the object itself.  Your conduct has
been that of a gentleman, and I should be wanting in respect to myself, and
courtesy to you, to think otherwise than seriously of it," was the wily 
reply
of Margaret.

     "You have my own thoughts," said the colonel.

     "There is my ma'," said Margaret, as the knocker and bell sounded.

     "You will do your utmost with Mrs. Meredith for me, and I will beseech
her myself," said the colonel; "I hope she will take things in a favourable
light."

 Next Week: Mrs. Meredith's Consultation with Mr. Twissel, and Her Resolve.




                              CHAPTER CXXXIII.

MRS. MEREDITH'S CONSULTATION WITH MR. TWISSEL, AND HER RESOLVE.


     Mrs. Meredith's arrival was very opportune, for it broke off the
interview; and Margaret descended to the parlour, where her mother she knew
would repair the moment she had freed herself from her dress.  Margaret was
now left alone for a few moments.  She felt all the exultation of success in 
a
strategy, and all the exhilaration of spirits that such a prospect of wealth
and riches floating before her eyes, and all the natural consequents upon 
such
possessions would give rise to.

     "I shall be rich," she thought.  "Aye, I shall not only be rich, but 
very
rich-- I know I shall.  Well, he is old-- no matter; better be an old man's
darling, than a young man's slave.  Yes; I shall know how to use wealth.  I
shall be able to spend a little of his countless hoards, and he will not
thwart me, I am sure.  He will be too fond-- too doating, by far.  I shall 
be
indulged like a spoiled child, I am sure."

     Margaret smiled at the thought of what length the colonel might not be
induced to carry his fondness for her.

     "He will not set any value upon what will give me pleasure.  I am sure 
he
will give me all I ask.  I have but to ask him for what I want, and he must
comply.  I am sure he is too easy-- too quiet and generous to make a 
moment's
hesitation."

     The colonel, too, was left to his reflections, but as to what they were
we know not.  He sat long, silently gazing at the fire.

     Mrs. Meredith now entered the apartment, and, looking at her daughter,
she said, --

     "Eh! something been said, Margaret?  I can see by your eye that the
colonel has said something to you.  Am I not right, my dear?"

     "Yes, ma'; you are right."

     "Well, my love, and what did he say?  I am dying with curiosity."

     "It will be quite impossible to do that; but he has been quite explicit
enough, without any hesitation at all, or any reserve-- quite candid and
open."

     "He has offered?"

     "Yes; he wishes for your consent; for I told him I could not possibly
decide without your consent and countenance.  He did not disapprove of that,
only he wished to propitiate you in his favour, and begged me to let him 
have
the satisfaction of knowing that he had my good wishes, and that I could 
look
upon him in a warmer light than a mere friend."

     "Which I hope you did?"

     "Yes, ma'.  I let him imagine that I was not indifferent to his good
opinion; but, at the same time, I would not commit myself, but left him to
infer a good deal.  I think I know, ma', how to manage such an affair well-- 
I
may say, very well."

     "Exactly, my love.  I was sure you would."

     "Yes, ma'; I should think I did.  For when I found he had proceeded a
certain distance, I was resolved that he should speak out plump at once; and
when I found he paused, I paused too, and he was compelled to explain; but 
he
betrayed no unwillingness, or anything like hesitation at all, but he has
fairly proposed himself to me."

     "And you have not committed yourself?"

     "Not in the least."

     "Very well.  I must be cautious, too not to do so; because I must have
some conversation with Mr. Twissel, so that we may proceed in a safe manner,
and not commit ourselves in any way as we shall repent of afterwards."

     "How do you mean?"

     "Why, child, you would not marry the colonel if he was not a rich man."

     "Not exactly; though I must admit, ma', he is a very nice man-- a very
nice man, and I should be entitled to a widow's pension, if nothing more, 
and
that I might not have under some circumstances; even you yourself have been
left worse off, you see."

     "Yes, my child; but circumstances alter cases.  I had a better prospect
when I first married, else I would not have done so, you may depend upon it.
However, we can always retrace our steps, and he cannot.  But I will get Mr.
Twissel to come and see into matters a bit for us."

     "Well, ma', you shall do as you think fit-- only, take care not to 
throw
away a good chance because you have greater hopes."

     "Has he said anything about his property?"

     "Not a word, except it was to intimate it was large, and he had won it
very hardly, with great danger; but he did not say what it consisted of.  Of
course I could not ask."

     "Oh, dear, no."

     "But he intimated he would keep a carriage, and a country house, as 
well
as a town house, besides several other matters, which makes it plain enough 
he
has been used to plenty; besides, as he spoke to me in describing some 
scenes
in India, he appeared so much animated that I am sure he must be what he
appears to be, and what he says he is."

     "Ah, well, I think myself it is all quite right, and that we shall have
nothing to repent there; but we will let all go on but the naming of the 
day--
that must not be named, for, if we do, we shall not be able to retract."

     "Oh, no, we shall not have any occasion to do that, I think; but I dare
say he will speak to you to-night, as there is time at supper especially."

     "No doubt.  You may as well retire early, so that you may be absent, 
and
that will give us greater liberty to talk than if you were presnt, my dear.  
I
wish Mr. Twissel were here; but it can't be helped; and when he does come, I
must have some conversation with him, and I must, in the meantime, learn 
what
I can for him to inquire about afterwards."

     Thus resolved, Margaret went to bed early, leaving her mother to attend
upon the colonel, who sat looking at the fire without any change of posture
since the last time he was seen by the girl; but Mrs. Meredith caused him to
break the steady gaze and deep thought he was indulging in.

     "I hope you have been quite well, colonel, since I left?"

     "Yes, quite well, Mrs. Meredith."

     "What would you choose for supper?"

     "Margaret---"

     "Eh?" said Mrs. Meredith, amazed.

     "I beg your pardon; I did not know you were near-- at least, I did not
know I spoke at the moment; but, pray, what did you desire to know?"

     "What you would have for supper, sir?"

     "Oh, whatever you have at hand; some of what we had for dinner-- I 
think
I should like it as soon as you feel disposed to have it.  I am ready-- 
quite
ready."

     "Then it shall be had at once, sir," said Mrs. Meredith; "I will order 
it
up immediately, for it is later than I intended to have stopped out; but the
hours so soon ran away, and there were so many motives to forget the time 
that
was flying so fast."

     The supper was soon laid, and the colonel and Mrs. Meredith alone sat
down to it, at his earnest request.  Indeed, they used to have meals much in
common; for the colonel professed to be very fond of female company, and was
desirous of their company, which they translated into a desire for the
presence of Margaret herself.

     The supper was laid and over before the colonel said anything; but
appeared to be absorbed in deep thought, from which it was difficult to 
arouse
himself.  But at length, after looking around once or twice, and not seeing
Margaret at table, he said to Mrs. Meredith, --

     "I hope I have not driven your daughter away."

     "Oh, no, sir; she complains of headache, and has gone to bed somewhat
earlier than usual."

     "I fear I must lay the blame on myself."

     "She did not say you were the cause," replied Mrs. Meredith, "of her
ailment; and, therefore, I think you must be free from blame; for she would
have said so, if it had so happened.  She generally speaks the truth in such
matters, at least, and, I believe, in every other."

     "No doubt; but I have been speaking upon a subject that concerns my own
happiness to her, and perhaps the excitement may have caused her some evil 
of
that sort.  She would not, perhaps, name it to you, Mrs. Meredith; but I 
will.
You have been a wife yourself, and know that a few candid words are better,
and more to the purpose, than a long desultory courtship."

     "Yes, sir; it certainly is so."

     "There is some difference, too, in our ages," said the colonel.  "I 
have
not overlooked that matter, at all events; but I hope that will be no cause 
of
impediment or objection."

     "It cannot be, sir, in such a case as your own, for instance."

     "Well, then, I have proposed for her husband.  I wish to make her my
wife.  I am yet hale and hearty, and have some few years yet which I could
wish to pass in happiness, and which I will use to make her happy.  And if I
die early, I have ample means of providing for her-- of leaving her a most
handsome and ample fortune.  Not more than she deserves; but possibly more
than she might have thought of seeking."

     "Certainly, sir."

     "Then I wish for your consent to our future happiness."

     "You may have my good wishes," said Mrs. Meredith.

     "You are very good," said the colonel; "and I trust your daughter
will live long to make you happy by making her own apparent to you."

     "Of course," said Mrs. Meredith, "this is rather a sudden affair; you
will not think of hurrying it to a conclusion, but permit her to become
acquainted with you, and to know her own mind."

     "Certainly, I do wish it pushed on to a conclusion; but not so much so 
as
to cause any dissatisfaction.  I am anxious to call he wife.  My feelings 
are
those of an ardent lover."

     "I do not dispute it."

     "Still you and she must be the best judges of all this.  You will not, 
I
hope, punish me by compelling me to a longer probation than you are 
compelled
to put me to.  I am not like a young man who has a fortune, or rather a 
living
to earn; but I have one ready, a handsome one, and my wife will be a lady of
fortune when I die."

     "Do not think of dying at such a moment, sir."

     "Why, it is not desirable," said the colonel, who did not deem it
necessary to carry the conversation on any further that night; thinking,
possibly, enough had been said for the first occasion of revealing his
passion, and he, no doubt, considered his success signal.

     The supper then passed off in the usual style, and Mrs. Meredith left 
the
colonel, and wished him good night, wiht feelings somewhat akin to triumph,
and returned to her own daughter's room, there to cogitate and sleep upon 
what
had that evening taken place.

           *             *             *             *             *

     The next day she determined to send to Mr. Twissel, and arrange the
meeting she desired; and, at the same time, she resolved that she would not
push matters to the extremity, of making a point of knowing what his 
property
were, for she might lose all; she was convinced that the colonel must be a 
man
of large property; how could such a man live if he were not.

     That was a speculation she could not help indulging in.  She knew that 
a
man in Colonel Deverill's line of life was quite able to support himself;
besides, the jewels he had about him were worth a large sum of money; 
putting
all things together, she considered it was not worth while to lose so good, 
so
excellent an opportunity as the present for making a brilliant, at least, an
excellent settlement for her daughter, and a home for herself.

     "There can be no fear," she muttered; "there can be no fear; her 
widow's
pension will be a better support to her than the livelihood of some."

     Mr. Twissel was sent for; and, the papers she desired to find for him,
she was fortunate enough to discover, and laid them by at once.  The 
attorney
came willingly enough, and was well pleased when he was informed of the
success of the search after the papers, and produced the bond, by which she
agreed to give him one hundred pounds for his assistance in the marriage
affair.

     However, he did not seem to agree with her, that she should not be over
particular about the colonel's property; he thought that there must be some
inquiries made respecting it, to ascertain if there were any or none.

     "But," suggested Mrs. Meredith, "the colonel is a kind, but a proud 
man,
and he would, probably, take great and deep offence at any inquiry being 
made
into his pecuniary affairs."

     "Hardly, my dear madam; don't you see, love would be strong enough to
counter-balance that; he would make some allowance for paternal anxiety and
love."

     "There is much reason in all that; yet I have heard so much of these
nabobs, that one is afraid to lose a good chance by inadvertently touching
their weak points; for, the kind of society and company they have, their's 
is
so different to what they find here."

     "Yes, that is very true; but we should like to know that it is true. 
What service has he been in-- I think, though, you said in the East India
Service?"

     "Yes."

     "Well, then, I will make some inquiries at the house; they will answer 
my
inquiries, and no one will even be the wiser for it; they will, at least, 
tell
me if there is such a person in the service, and, perhaps, I can learn
something more."

     "Very well, that may be done.  Will you come round with me to tea this
evening, as I will contrive to bring you in the presence of Colonel 
Deverill,
whom you will then see and converse with?  I am not sure of it, but I will 
try
to do so."

     "I will be here," said the attorney; and, in the mean time, I will make
the necessary inquiries."

     They parted upon this mutual good understanding; and the attorney, in
high spirits, for the papers were of great value to him, and the promised
reward was a stimulous to a greater exertion on behalf of Mrs. Meredith and
her daughter, for he thought he could do business for the Colonel, after 
this
affair was settled-- such an opportunity of increasing his connection did 
not
offer every day.

     Mrs. Meredith redoubled her assiduity about the person of Colonel
Deverill; and, at the same time, lost no opportunity of putting her daughter
forward; nor was that daughter a bit disinclined to take such opportunity as
was offered her, of making the most of herself on this occasion, to appear
amiable, and in some new and languishing position, or to perform some new
service for the colonel.

 Next Time: The Introduction. -- The Attorney's First Feeler.




                            CHAPTER CXXIV. [sic]

                               [Chapter 134]

THE INTRODUCTION. -- THE ATTORNEY'S FIRST FEELER.


     When the attorney had left the house he proceeded upon some business of
his own, and then he proceeded to the India House for the purpose of making
inquiries after the colonel, for his friend Mrs. Meredith.  In the course of
the day he did go to the India House, and, upon making some inquiries, he 
was
sent to a particular department of the house where he saw two gentlemen.

     "Pray, sir," said one, "what do you want?"

     "I wish to make some inquiries concerning a Colonel Deverill, who is
employed, or was serving, in the Honourable East India service."

     "In what part was he serving?"

     "In India," said the attorney.

     "But, to what presidency did he belong?"

     "That I do not even know.  He has been many years away from England, I
understand, and some of his friends have not heard from him for many years,
and they are desirious of finding out whether he is dead or alive; and if 
so,
where he is."

     "There is a Colonel Deverill returned this year from India."

     "Indeed!  Do you know anything of him?"

     "Nothing more than he has retired from the service on his half pay, 
some
time before he came home, on account of his wounds."

     "Is he rich?"

     "I can answer no such question."

     "I am a solicitor, and do not ask the question from an improper 
motive."

     "You may not, sir, but we cannot answer such a a question.  We have no
inquisitorial knowledge of the private circumstances of those gentlemen who
have served in the company's army; but, you put it to your won sagacity to
consider how far it would be probable for a man so placed, as regards rank 
and
opportunity, in India, without making money."

     "I see; certainly-- he must."

     "And yet, you know, there are means of getting rid of money."

     "To be sure.  I see."

     "Not that I have any idea that such can be the case; indeed, I should 
be
disposed to believe the contrary, seeing the colonel must have been wounded
long since, for the last engagement must have been some few years since."

     "Thank you.  I will report what I have learned.  You do not know where 
he
can be found at this time?"

     "No, indeed; we have no information."

     This being all he could learn, he left the India House, and as it was 
now
about time to return to Mrs. Meredith, he at once went back, and having seen
all his business transacted, he had now leisure to go there, and in a short
time he arrived, and at once related to her all that he had heard respecting
the colonel, from the first to the last word of it.

     "Well," said Mrs. Meredith, "that, at all events, is very 
satisfactory."

     "Yes, it is something," said the attorney, "to know your man; but, as 
the
clerk said, he might have spent it, that is to say, dissipated it."

     "Oh, it's impossible; he's been an invalid a long while now."

     "Ah! there's no knowing what might be done in these cases.  Who knows
what he may have done-- gambled and diced it away, and entered into
extravagant speculations, which may have turned out ruinous bubbles."

     "Well, well, Mr. Twissell, we won't say much about what might be," said
Mrs. Meredith; "we won't care about them; but I am very much obliged to you
for this trouble.  It is, however, a very satisfactory thing to know he is
what he represented himself to be."

     "Yes, that is a very great point gained."

     "His veracity having been found unimpeachable in one point, may be
presumed to be so in another," said Margaret.  "It appeared to me to be
extremely probable, if not quite certain, he is what he appears to be, I am
glad that all is so far good."

     "Be that as it may, it will be more satisfactory to know what his
property really consists of, and how much there is about it."

     "No doubt; but it would not be worth while to risk anything on that
account; he might imagine we were mercenary, and that would disgust him
altogether."

     "That's what I am fearful of," said the mother.

     "We may not yet have occasion to ask him any question, or to make any
inquiries of him at all, for we may be able to worm it all out of him."

     "That is true," said Mrs. Meredith.  "Dear me, there is the bell.  Go,
Margaret, and say we have an old friend come to to tea; perhaps he will 
excuse
you-- he may give the invitation we desire.["]

     Margaret at once departed, and proceeded to the colonel's room, and 
began
to wait upon him as usual; but he saw there was but one cup placed.

     "Are you not going to take tea with me, Margaret?" he said.  Am I to be 
a
prisoner, and put in solitary confinement for the evening?"

     "Why, colonel, Mr. Twissel has called to take tea with my mother, and 
as
he was a very old and particular acquiaintance of my father's, I do not like
to put a slight upon him."

     "He is a gentleman, I presume?"

     "Oh, yes, colonel, he is a member of the profession of the law."

     "Oh!  Well, will you ask him to tea with me?  As we shall be both 
united,
I hope your friends will soon be mine; there can be no great objection to 
our
acquaintance beginning earlier.  I am not fond of being entirely alone," [.]

     "If we shall not be intruding upon you, sir," said Margaret, "I dare 
say
my mother will.  I will tell her of your kindness immediately," [.]

     In a few moments Margaret returned to her mother and the attorney, to
whom she related the invitation she had received from the colonel, and
instantly clutched at the idea of going to the colonel to tea, the thing, of
all others, she most desired to do, and, at the same time, she had 
calculated
upon it; for the colonel appeared to be wholly dependant upon them for
society, which he appeared to be passionately fond of there, especially
Margaret.

     "That is just fortunate.  Now, Mr. Twissel," said Mrs. Meredith, "you
will be cautious, and do not make any open attempt to discover what may be 
the
peculiar species of property he holds; it may do much mischief, you know."

     "I am at your mercy," said the lawyer; "if you say so, I will not make
any attempt, though I must tell you, Mrs. Meredith, that you will be to 
blame
if you allow your daughter to marry without some inquiry being made; and if 
he
mean well, he will take no offence."

     "You may do what you can without broaching the subject to him.  Still I
think we have heard enough to set all doubts at rest."

     "I'm a professional man, my dear madam, and know what the world is, and
have had much experience in these matters; however, as I think there is much
probability in all he says, why, you shall see I will not do anything that
will offend the nicest delicacy."

     "That will be all we want, Mr. Twissel; and now come up stairs."

     "Mr. Twissel, Colonel Deverill-- Colonel Deverill, Mr. Twissel, an old
and dear friend of my late husband, sir, who has called to visit us."

     "I am very happy to see the gentleman," said the colonel, but with the
air of a man who is conscious of his own superiority, and that he is
committing a condescending act.  "Will you please to be seated.  Excuse my
rising, sir; I am an invalid, and am lame; but you are welcome."

     "I am much obliged," returned the attorney, bowing.  "My good friend 
Mrs.
Meredith has made me intrude upon you, else I had not done so."

     "You are welcome, sir," again repeated Colonel Deverill.  "Pray be
seated; I have seen but little company, and am glad now and then to converse
with any one.  Will you oblige me, Mrs. Meredith, with making tea for us?
Your services are really invaluable."

     "Ah, Colonel! you are really too good."

     "Not at all.  I'm afraid I'm too much in the rear of the march of
courtesy since I left England, as our habits and manners in the East are 
very
different to what they are here."

     "Ah!  I dare say they live in a style of regal magnificence and
splendor," said the attorney.

     "Yes; more so than you may at first imagine, and more so than in
appearance; so much so that it is difficult for the law at all times to take
its course.  It becomes a mere dead letter, and the matter usually ends in
some indignity being offered to its servants.["]

     "Indeed, sir! that was dangerous."

     "Not at all.  It was an attorney, who having deputed some one to serve 
a
process, and finding that he could not, imagined that it was the fault of 
the
process server, and he determined to make the attempt himself, being well
assured that he could succeed.  However, he found himself mistaken, for, 
after
several disasters, that he was led into purposely, he was well pumped upon 
by
some slaves, and thought himself lucky in escaping with life."

     "That would never have been permitted here," said the attorney.

     "No, possibly not; but there are not the distinctions between classes
here that there are there, and things are not on the same scale, either 
living
or attendance."

     "And yet, people who have passed their lives there, come to this 
country
at last, they do not like it well enough to remain there.  They come back to
the land of their birth, where none of these things exist to fascinate 
them."

     "Yes; they many live and die there-- very many; but, at the same time,
those who do return, do so because it is the land of their birth-- because
they love the country, and because they go there merely to make fortunes to
come here and spend them."

     ["]They don't like the kind of investments, perhaps?"

     "They usually do so, and it fetches a high price-- a very high price, 
and
is considered equal to the stocks of the Bank of England."

     "That is first-rate stock, and on dividend days the place is usually
surrounded with strangers, who come to town for the purpose of receiving 
their
incomes; indeed, it is quite an interesting sight to strangers.  Have you 
ever
witnessed it?  It is well worth the while to go and see it."

     "I never trouble myself anything about it," said the colonel; "but I 
must
be going there, by the way, to-morrow.  I must have a coach."

     "Do you know the routine of the banking business?  It is confusing to 
one
not used to it."

     "I know enough for my own purpose."

     "Didn't you find London much altered," inquired Margaret, anxious to 
give
a turn to the conversation, as she thought this attorney's conversation 
would
appear as if it were much too pointed-- "when you fisrt returned to England,
and came to live here again?"

     "I cannot say much about that," said the colonel; "because I was not in 
a
condition to twist about like many men; I am lame."

     "Exactly; that must have deprived you of much of the pleasure one feels
in surveying old places and well remembered spots."

     "It was," replied the colonel; "but in a place like London, alterations
and additions are not so extensive as to cause any alteration in general
features, so as to make it perceivable at once.  It is only when you come to
examine localities that you notice it.  You improve and alter parts, but the
town is the same, and there is no doubt this appears th work of steady 
growth,
and not any one of sudden effort; indeed, the very additions to it have a
character which stamp it as being London."

     "There is much truth about that," said the attorney.

     "It is the same all over the world, and only in those places where the
extent is but small, than any great alteration makes a conspicuous and 
general
change, and gives a new character to the place."

     As this conversation passed between them, the attorney making one or 
two
delicate allusions to property, and asking his advice respecting some
purchases he wished to make.  To all which the colonel made but short and
direct answers, and of such character, that it was difficult to carry on the
conversation upon that topic, at least, and both mother and daughter looked
beseechingly at him, so that he was compelled to resist, and found himself
completely baffled by what appeared the colonel's pride.

             *            *            *            *            *

     "Well, Mrs. Meredith," said Mr. Twissel; "I have done my utmost with 
this
Colonel Deverill, and I can make nothing of him-- nothing at all, I assure
you."

     "You cannot form a bad opinion of him?"

     "No-- no.  He is at one moment one of the most agreeable men to 
converse
with, and the next moment he is frigid and severe; perhaps pain, or perhaps
contempt for any one else, may induce the alteration in his manner, and no
allusion to himself does he make."

     "Don't you think he is quite the gentleman, and a man used to good
society?"

     "Yes, I cannot doubt-- he has the air of all that he says; but he is
going to the bank to-morrow; now, I wonder if it is to receive dividends."

     "I dare say it is," said Mrs. Meredith; "I have very little doubt of
that, and yet I should very much like to know; it would settle one's mind--
not that I would run any risk about the matter.  I would not have him 
offended
for the world; it would be wilfully destroying a chance that is so good, 
that
we never can expect it to again occur, therefore we must not lose it."

     "Certainly not; I will undertake the matter myself," said the attorney,
"so that there shall not be any risk in a miscarriage, whatever.  I will 
take
care that nothing shall be done that will be at all likely to reach his 
ears,
or that will be displeasing to him."

     "We will trust to your prudence, Mr. Twissel.["]

     "You may do so safely, and depend upon my caution in this matter.  Now 
I
will be at hand in the morning.  If I am not here before he goes out, send 
for
me, and let me know the hour; if there is not time to reach here send me the
number of the coach; I will post off to the bank and there await until I see
him come there."

     "I will send to you, then," said Mrs. Meredith; "I think that a very 
good
plan."

     "But what will it do for you if you do see him enter the bank, that 
will
tell you nothing, and I cannot see the utility of it," said Margaret; "many
people go into the Bank of England, who do not go there to receive any money
for themselves; so that would be inconclusive."

     "It would," said the attorney; "but you must remember, I can enter too,
and ascertain to what portion of the building he goes, and I can learn how
much he received, if any-- but I must bid you good-by; for the present; do 
not
forget to send to me at the first blush of the affair, and then much
subsequent trouble may be saved.

 An Unpleasant Dilemma.

MR. TWISSEL'S MISADVENTURES. -- THE CONSEQUENCES OF BEING FOUND IN THE BANK
WITHOUT GIVING A SATISFACTORY ACCOUNT OF YOUR BUSINESS THERE. -- AN 
UNPLEASANT
DILEMMA.


     The peculiar position of Mrs. Meredith and her daughter Margaret, in 
some
measure, and to a great degree, tied their hands, and caused a corresponding
desire to know more than was told them; at the same time, they were fearful 
of
giving any offence to their new and wealthy lodger.  They were both 
avaricious
and designing.  To make a good settlement was the grand object of their 
lives,
and to that object they would sacrifice themselves -- at least, sacrifice
Margaret, who, by-the-bye, would consider it no sacrifice at all, but a 
great
stroke of good luck.

     However, they could do nothing of themselves; they saw there was a 
great,
and glorious chance for the future; they felt they had entangled the 
colonel;
they felt he had become a victim to their snares, and they were unwilling 
that
they should run any risk of a failure of their plans.

     "If we offend him, he may consider us avaricious and designing," they
argued; "and that might prove too strong an antidote to even an old man's
love, and the prize might be snatched out of our hands, and we might not 
only
lose a rich husband, but a good lodger also."

     These considerations induced them to act more warily and cautious than
the attorney, Mr. Twissel, who was anxious at once to seize the bull by the
horns, and come to an explanation, and thus save himself much labour and 
time,
for the sooner there was an explanation the better; and he did not apprehend
the result that they did; he believed it would only appear proper caution on
the part of a mother.

     They had different opinions; and, between the two, there was an
indecisive policy adopted, which occasioned delay and uncertainty.

     There was no doubt but the colonel meant matrimony; his infirmities 
were
of no consequence.  It was not the man, but the money, that was wanted, and
which was sought with perseverance and constancy.  They appeared negligent 
of
money matters before the colonel; and, when he paid them, which he did
regularly, he alwasys appeared to have money about him, which, of course,
increased their respect, and gave them increased confidence in him.

     "It is all very well, ma," said Margaret, "but Mr. Twissel must not
offend Colonel Deverill; he is evidently a man much above him; his actions 
and
manner are such, that at once stamp him immeasurably his superior; now, as
regards this property, there can be no doubt but he must have enough."

     "I think so, too, my dear; but it would be a dreadful thing if it 
should
turn out otherwise in the end; it would really be very dreadful; I should
never survive it."

     "Nor I mother."

     "What is to be done? -- I declare I am at my wits' end."

     "There is no fear, ma; do you not remember that Mr. Twissel himself has
found out that he is Colonel Deverill, and that he has retired from the army
of the Company?"

     "Indeed, my dear, that is correct; I had forgotten that-- quite 
forgotten
it; but it may so happen he has no money at all; he may have spent it."

     "He does not appear to be extravagant," said Margaret; "he has retired
upon his half-pay, which you know must be a very good living, and I am sure 
of
a widow's pension, if nothing more; and, besides, I am sure, from what he 
has
said, there must be money."

     "Well, I think so, too, my dear," said Mrs. Meredith; "and I think it
will be better that things should go on as the colonel desires; to lose him
him [sic] would be horribly aggravating."

     "So it will, ma, because I am sure he will do justice.  It is not like 
as
if we had money, too, and were as willing to have our affairs investigated, 
as
we are to investigate his."

     "That is very true, my dear, very true; and Mr. Twissel does not seem 
to
know that; that I will tell him when I see him; by the way, I must send to
him, to tell him the colonel is going out in about an hour.  If he can find
out anything, without compromising us in the affair, why, he may do so, and
welcome; for, you must acknowledge, it will be all the more satifactory."

     "Yes, yes, I admit that; but I would not wilfully lose a good
opportunity."

     "I must now send off to him.  Mary must go, and that, too, as quickly 
as
she can; for I shall want her back again very soon, so she must run."

     "Then, the sooner she goes the better," said Margaret.

     Mary was sent to Mr. Twissel, who happened to be at home at the time, 
and
judging that Mary had been a good time on the road, that there would be no
time to go to Mrs. Meredith's house, and then follow the coach, so he
determined to go to the bank at once, so that he would be there in time to 
see
the colonel descend and enter the bank, into which he would follow him.

     He sent word back to Mrs. Meredith that he would go on, and see her as
soon after as he could; and then he made the best of his way towards the 
bank,
where he arrived in good time-- indeed, half-an-hour before the colonel, who
did not set out so soon as he intended.

     "Now," thought Twissel, "if he were to turn out all right, why, I shall
be in good fortune; but if bad, it would be laid upon my shoulders.  They
shall not say that I have not given them attention enough for their money; 
and
if I don't do something, they will say I haven't earned my money; and though 
I
can enforce payment of the bond, yet it may hurt my future prospects with
regard to my future connection with the family, which I hope to make a
profitable one in the long run."

     Filled with these thoughts, he determined to watch with due caution for
the arrival of the colonel, on the other side of the way.

     It was some time before the coach drove up, which it did after a
considerable lapse of time, and then Mr. Twissel crossed over, and placed
himself in a position by the lamp-post where he could obtain a good view of
any one passing in and out of the coach.

     "'Tis he," he muttered, as he saw the colonel step out of the carriage,
and walk into the bank very leisurely and quietly, leaning upon his stick, 
and
walking lame.  He watched him into the bank -- he saw him go some distance
down the passage, and then he muttered, --

     "Now, I will follow him up closely."

     And, after a moment's pause to permit some one to pass him, he then
darted down the passage into a kind of yard; but no, he could not see him; 
he
was not there; and yet he was so lame, he could not have got out of sight so
soon as all that.

     "He's gone to the dividend-office," he muttered; "I shall find him
there," and away he posted to that department; but he could not find him, he
was -- he was not there.  Then what could have become of him?  That was a
point he could not solve.

     "Well, this is very odd," he muttered; "very odd."

     He paused to think over the matter; but that did not aid him.  He was 
in
the dark but thought it was no use in waiting in any one place, so wandered
about from office to office, until he came to the body of the place, when he
waited until some one came up to him, and touched him on the shoulder.  He
turned round, and at once perceived it was an officer.

     "What do you want with me?" inquired Twissel.

     "What is your business here?" returned the officer, by way of reply.

     "I am here upon my own business.  I am at a loss to understand what you
mean by asking me such a question in a public place.  What can you mean by 
it?
I was never asked such a question before, and cannot see why you should do 
so
now."

     "Excuse me, sir, I have ample warrant for what I am doing."

     "Have you?  Then state it."

     "Easily.  I have followed you about this last half-hour, and you have
been wandering about the place for some time, and looking about you in a
manner that has excited a good deal of suspicion, to say the least of it; 
and
I must have some satifactory explanation."

     "You can have that," replied Mr. Twissel, very  much annoyed; "you can
have any explanation you can require.  I am very sure I came here on my own
affairs; what other explanation can you require?"

     "Your affairs may be ours also, and the explanation you have given will
be just enough to justify my taking you into custody-- so if you have no 
more
to say, I must request the favour of your company; that's my card of
invitation; do you hear, sir?"

     "Yes, I do; I am an attorney-at-law, and you may depend upon it I will
not be content without punishing you for this indignity-- I came in here
because I saw a friend call, to whom I wanted to speak."

     "Where is he?"

     "I don't know," said Twissel; "I have missed him."

     "Very likely, and your friend will miss you for a short time; for you
must come with me; -- you have been found here without being able to give 
any
account of yourself."

     "I tell you I came in here to see Colonel Deverill."

     "Well, what do we know of Colonel Deverill?  We don't know anything 
about
him, nor you either; you must come with me.  We are obligated to be very
particular when we see strangers walking about with no object whatever in
view-- it is very suspicious."

     "But I tell you I am a respectable attorney-- a professional man.  I 
had
no bad object in view."

     "That may be as you say; but you must come with me."

     Seeing there no help for it, Mr. Twissel resigned himself into the
officer's hands, and followed him to the station-house, where he was 
examined
byt the inspector, at the place where he was taken.

     "Well, sir," said the inspector, "this may be all very true, but we 
must
have some proof of what you assert; then we can let you go."

     "I'll have a complaint against you."

     "You may; but you must prove not only that what you say is true, but 
that
there was no cause for suspicion, and that you were not loitering about the
bank, as the officer asserts you were."

     The attorney thought that it would be quite unnecessary to get into the
public prints, because it would not do for  him to make use of Colonel
Deverill's name; and that he had already done.  What was he do do? he had 
got
into a very disagreeable scrape, out of which he must now get in the best
manner possible, and which he could not see his way clear to do.

     "What do you want me to do?"

     "Give us some proof that you are the person whom you represent yourself
to be," he replied, "and then we can let you go at once."

     "Then I will give you my card," said Twissel, producing his card-case.

     "That is no proof," said the constable.  "A man might have robbed you 
of
your card-case, and you would have some one passing himself off for 
yourself."

     "What shall I do, then?" inquired Twissel.

     "Send for some one who knows you, or send for your own clerk-- that 
will
do."

     "That I can do at once," replied Twissel; and he at once wrote a note 
to
his clerk, and gave it unsealed into the hands of the constable, and asked 
if
there was any one who would go with it.

     "You can send a messenger; there are many who will do that if you pay
them for it," replied the constable; and in another minute, for the sum of
half-a-crown, a messenger agreed to take the letter to his office, and 
deliver
it to his clerk, and wait for him.

     This was done, and until that time he was locked up in a cell, where he
had a light certainly, but in which he had no other comfort at all; but in
about an hour and a half there was the prospect of a relief; for he saw his
clerk come into the station-house, and with him the messenger, who came to 
the
constable and said that was Mr. Twissel's clerk.

     "Do you know Mr. Twissel?" inquired the constable.

     "Yes, I do; he is my employer."

     "Then point him out," said the constable.

     At that moment, Mr. Twissel was brought in, and he at once pointed him
out to the satisfaction of the constable, who, with an admonition, consented
to the enlargement of Mr. Twissel, and in answer to his threat of future
investigation, said to him, --

     "You see, sir, the bank is such a place, that we are compelled to keep
all persons out who have no business there, and it must not be a place where
people meet who have no particular bank business to transact; do not wait
about, then, for the future, sir, else you may run the same danger."

     Mr. Twissel left the station-house with a feeling very much akin to
anger, and he walked home with a very disagreeable feeling.  He felt that he
had been baffled, and had been also much ill-used, and very much affronted.

     "Where could he have got to?" he murmured.  "He must have turned in 
some
of the offices-- confound him!  I wish he had taken it into his head to
tumble.  I am sure he ain't no good; if he were, I should not have been 
placed
in such an unpleasant position."

     Suddenly he recollected that there was no necessity for his going home,
unless there had been anything happened since his departure; and upon being
informed that such was not the case, he determined to alter his course, and
proceed to Mrs. Meredith, and relate the misfortunes that had befallen him.

     "And if that don't satify her I have her interest at heart, why, 
nothing
will."

     And he left his clerk, after giving him some directions, and then 
turned
off towards Bloomsbury-square, where he arrived just before tea time.

                                Chapter 136]

AN EVENING WITH COLONEL DEVERILL. -- THE STRATAGEM OF MRS. MEREDITH.


        Mr. Twissel seated himself by Mrs. Meredith's fire, not at all 
pleased
with what he had anticipated and expected on that day, and yet well pleased
that there was an end to it; but, at the same time, he had conceived a 
dislike
for the colonel, of which the reader can easily guess the reason. The 
colonel
had received him rather haughtily, and he was annoyed at it, and he was
resolved that he would do him no service; and now, the indignity he had
received was so vexing, that he knew not on whom to wreak his anger -- at 
all
events, it gave him a great dislike to the colonel, which would require a
considerable time to overcome.

        He sat there, waiting for Mrs. Meredith, who was then engaged
somewhere else; but it was not long before she entered the apartment in 
which
Mr. Twissel sat meditating upon his misadventure, and considering in his own
mind what would be the best course to pursue.

        "Oh, Mr. Twissel!" she said, "I hope you have not been waiting long
for me."

        "Not long, ma'am."

        "And how have you got on to-day, Mr. Twissel?"

        "Rather indifferently indeed," said Twissel, with a groan; "I may 
say
very indifferently indeed.  I have had plenty of incident -- I may say of
adventure -- I ought to say misadventure, which appears to have dogged me 
step
by step in this affair."

        "Indeed! I am amazed at that," said Mrs. Meredith.

        "You would be more so if you knew all."

        "Tell me what has happened, Mr. Twissel," said Mrs. Meredith.  "I am
anxious to hear to hear what can have happened to you of this character.  I
hope it did not happen in consequence of your doing anything in this affair 
of
Colonel Deverill's."

        "Indeed it did, Mrs. Meredith," said the attorney, solemnly.  "I 
have
been sedulously engaged in this affair, and I have been seriously
inconvenienced by it."

        "I regret it very much."

        "But you could not have helped it, Mrs. Meredith," said Twissel. 
"You
could not have helped it at all.  I know that very well, there fore there is
no blame attached to you.  You are free; but I have suffered, nevertheless.  
I
have suffered."

        "Dear me, how sorry I am, to be sure."

        "Yes, ma'am, but it can't be helped.  I was taken into custody as a
suspicious person, and had some difficulty in getting my release from
custody."

        Mrs. Meredith lifted her hands and her eyes to express the amount of
astonishment she felt.

        "Yes, Mrs. Meredith.  I followed the colonel into the Bank of 
England,
and there I saw him enter, but by some wonderful means he suddenly
disappeared.  I missed him, and could not again obtain the slightest clue to
him.  I did not again set eye upon him, and while endeavouring to regain the
track, I was taken into custody for loitering about."

        "Indeed.  Then you have learned nothing about the colonel?"

        "Nothing at all.  I missed him.  I saw him going into the bank, and
that was all."

        "Well, he has come back, and appears to have received money.  I 
should
think there could be doubt as to where he got it from."

        "It is a mystery."

        "Indeed.  I should hardly think it possible, as you saw him go in.
What would he go there for but for money matters?  It seems clear enough to
me.  I have no doubt in my own mind -- everything appears to be
straightforward and plain."

        "Indeed," muttered the attorney; "there is much truth in that.  I 
have
had a straightforward intimation that I have been considered a suspicious
person."

        "I regret it very much; but here's Margaret."

        At that moment Margaret entered the apartment in which her mother 
and
Mr. Twissel were seated.  There was an air of triumph in her eye when she
entered, and her mother at once divined the cause; but she said nothing, and
waited until Margaret spoke.

        "Ma," she said, "it is tea-time, and the colonel expects you up
stairs; and if you had any friends, he hoped you would not deprive him of 
your
company on that account, but bring them up stairs to tea.  He is 
particularly
good-humoured to night."

        "Curse him," involuntarily exclaimed the attorney, as he heard of 
the
good-humour the colonel was in, and he had so much cause to be vexed 
himself.

        "Will you come with us, Mr. Twissel?"

        "I will, thank you, ma'am.  I am very tired," said Twissel, as he
thought it would afford him some opportunity of discovering something that
would enable him to be revenged, and at the same time do a seeming service 
to
the other party.

        "At all events," he muttered, "it will give me a change of making a
more intimate and useful acquaintance with him.  I must do something or 
other,
and I may as well make a good thing of it as well as a bad one.  That 
wouldn't
be bad policy."

        "Then you had better come up at once," said Margaret, "for the tea 
is
waiting."

        Thus urged, Mrs. Meredith and Mr. Twissel followed Margaret, and
walked up to the drawing-room, where the colonel was, as before, seated in 
an
easy chair, with the green shade still over one eye, and his arm carried in 
a
sling, though he did not appear to have lost the entire use of it, and by 
his
side was his stick, a valuable Malacca cane, with which he walked, and his
lame foot was supported by an ottoman.

        "Well, sir," said the colonel, "I have the extreme felicity of 
meeting
you again; be seated.  It is a very charming day, the most comfortable that 
I
recollect since I have returned to England."

         "It is remarkably fine,:" said the attorney, shrugging his 
shoulders,
and giving a suspicious glance towards the colonel, as if he thought there 
was
a latent smile lurking upon the colonel's countenance; but he could not 
detect
it, and yet he felt very much aggravated.

        "There is, even in this climate," continued the colonel, "some 
decent
weather; but then, when matters go on happily and cheerfully, then the 
climate
appears more genial and kind."

        "Strange that it should be so," said Mr. Twissel; "but I can't help
thinking he looks more provoking than ever I saw in my life."

        As he muttered, the colonel said,--

        "What did you say, sir?"

        "I merely said that we, who are used to it, look upon it in some 
other
light than that of a merely negative character; that is, we look upon some 
of
it as positively good -- nay, we are apt to call it beautiful, especially 
when
it continues fine."

        "Continues fine!" said the colonel; "does it really continue fine in
this climate?"

        "Why, one would think, colonel, you have never been in this country
before, to hear you talk; and yet you are a native of this country."

        "Yes, I am; that is, I believe so; but I have spent so many years in
Asia, that I am more a native of India than this country.  However, I 
believe
what you say to be correct; but, you see, the slightest change of weather
affects my wounds, when you could not believe any change that had taken 
place;
or, at all events, the change would be so slight as to cause no difference 
to
you, and yet, even before that comes, I feel the approaching change."

        "I day say you do, sir; but it must be unpleasant in the extreme."

        "It certainly is; and I have found it so.  Mrs. Meredith, I hope you
enjoyed your walk; did you go far?"

        "No, Colonel, I did not; else I had not been back so soon.  By the
way, how do you feel after your walk, or, rather, ride?  I had not time to 
ask
you before."

        "Oh, I am very well; I enjoyed it much; but I must take another the
day after tomorrow," said the colonel.  "That is, another ride; for I cannot
walk far."

        "Do you intend going far?"

        "To the South Sea House," replied the colonel.

        "To the South Sea house," repeated the attorney to himself, as he
sipped his tea; "he has some of the stock on his hands.  Well, I dare say 
that
is likely; people belonging to these companies generally prefer them to any
other stock.  However, I will follow him there, and see if I can't do 
better. 
I will tread upon his heels but what I will find out something this time, at
all events."

        "Are you acquainted with that stock?" he inquired, after a pause.

        "What the South Sea Stock"? inquired the colonel.

        "Yes."

        "Not much; but I believe it to be a good, steady stock -- a very 
good
investment; it will pay you a better interest than the funds."

        "But is it as secure?"

        "Well, that is a very difficult thing to answer," said the colonel;
"but I think is safe enough.   I have that opinion of it that I do not 
object
to hold it."

        "That, of course, is the best answer one can have to its presumed
security."

        "Yes, I have a good opinion of it, and do not object holding it, as 
I
said before; and that is the best opinion that can well be offered.  Have 
you
any?"

        "None, sir; but I have a friend, who wanted to purchase stock of 
some
kind, or to place money out to advantage, and I wished to learn a little 
more
concerning it."

        "I do not mean to say there is no better; but when you have once
invested your money, you do not like to change the stock."

        "Certainly not; it is unadvisable," said the attorney, "unless you
have some specific reason for so doing at the best of times.  You are the
loser by the expenses."

        "Well," said Mrs. Meredith, "I am very glad to see you are so well
after your journey."

        "Journey, do you call it?  Why ma'am, I cannot call anything less 
than
some few hundred miles a journey; anything less is a mere bagatelle."

        "Dear me, colonel; what journeys you must have travelled."

        "Indeed I have, madam; some of hem beautiful and romantic, and some 
of
them dreary, and some terrible, from the obstacles that opposed us, and
others, from the nature of the ground that we had to go over, and the 
dangers
attendant from fatigue, climate, and the enemy."

        "It must be a terrible thing; females in those parts are out of the
question."

        "Oh! dear, no; there are ladies, and English ladies, too, who live
there for years, and who follow their husbands; movements with the camp, and
who undergo all the dangers and fatigues merrily and cheerfully, and even 
put
some of the best of us to the blush for fortitude."

        "Well, I am glad we have a good character, even so far off as 
India."

        "It cannot but be expected but the mothers of such men can bear
fatigue and hardship, else; their sons could never be what they are. 
However,
we have many examples of heroism in India, not of men only, but women also."

        "Then there are many interesting points for us to hear explanation
about India," said Margaret; "I love to hear such things, especially from
those who have been there, and mixed up among the people who live here, and
who have had much experience with them."

        "I hope we shall have ample time to talk over many such
matters,"returned the colonel, "for to me it is pleasant to speak of the 
past,
and relate all I have seen, known, and taken part in, in a place so distant
from us all, as our Eastern empire."

        "Indeed, I love to hear them," said Margaret.

        "I am afraid she will keep you pretty constantly employed in 
relating
all that you have ever seen, colonel," said Mrs. Meredith; "she's a strange
girl, and has many fancies that way; she fond of the wild, irregular life 
that
you describe; she would have made an excellent soldier's wife, I am sure;
she's so fond of that kind of thing."

        "I hope she will do so now, madam: and that she will have less of 
the
fatigue and danger that fall to the lot of a good many, for I candidly tell
you it is one thing to hear these things talked of, and another to bear with
them.  Plains of burning sand, and want of water, mountainous regions 
covered
with snow, and no means to obtain warmth and shelter, -- these are things
exciting enough in a narrative, and yet heartbreaking to experience."

        'Oh!" said the attorney; "there can be no doubt it's much better in
perspective, than it is to experience.  I can easily imagine when you hear 
of
battles and sieges, how they wish they had been there; and how much would 
have
been done by our individual exertions.  But, dear me, that's as different 
from
being shot in the beginning, and so seeing none of the fun that was to 
follow.
Lord bless my heart, being put out of the way in that manner, positively 
makes
me nervous, I do believe.  I could be hanged before I marched up to the
breach."

        "Fortunately, all men are not of that opinion, else we might all of 
us
be murdered in our beds, and no one to protect us," said Margaret,
contemptuously.

        "It is necessary," said the colonel, "that some men should be born 
for
one purpose, and some another.  Some are poltroons from their birth, and
require better men to take care of them, while others win honour and profit 
on
the field of death and danger, and snatch triumph from the hands of death."

        'Exactly," said the attorney; "half a loaf is better than no bread;
and half a man is better than no man at all; and I believe that many of them
leave the field of battle, leave it in a very little better state.  Now, I
should not care for life upon such terms; it must be such as is worth living
for, and such I do not consider life, when one is rendered a cripple all 
one's
life."

        "Well," said the colonel, "we all have out different ideas upon that
subject; but I rather think the state would be nothing without the 
profession
of arms, and the lawyers would grace the lamp-posts, if I might judge from
popular opinion."

        "Popular opinion is nothing in this country upon such matters," said
Twissel, contemptuously.

        "It amounts to something," retorted the colonel; "and you would say
so, I imagine, if you felt it clinging to your throat in the shape of a
halter, administered by the _canaille_."

        "Why," said Mrs. Meredith, "I dare say it isn't always expressed so
forcibly, and Mr. Twissel does not hold it of any importance, so long as it 
is
not expressed so loudly as that."

        "Certainly, Mrs. Meredith; that is my meaning; for an illegal act
committed by a contemptible portion of the population becomes of 
importance."

        "So it does," said the colonel; "that is easily verified."

        "But still we may be thankful to those who bravely fight and die, 
that
we may be here in ease and quiet, and free from danger, and able to enjoy 
our
lives and homes in peace."

        "That is true," said the attorney; "the one part of a nation cannot 
do
without another; all are necessary, and produce a powerful kingdom, and not
only powerful, but rich and intelligent."

        "No doubt of that," said the colonel.

        Tea was now cleared away, and some wine was placed upon the table, 
and
the colonel took a few glasses of some rare wine, of which he offered the
attorney to drink, and the latter willingly accepted, and found it some of 
the
best he had tasted; and he continued to taste it until he got quite 
talkative,
and, to the pain and mortification of Mrs. Meredith, began to talk in a 
strain
that would in a short time have done them much discredit and mischief.

        Mrs. Meredith, however, always full of expedient, soon devised on 
that
had the effect of putting an end to a scene she feared would come to an
unpleasant act, if continued in; and therefore, left the room for a few
minutes, and then when she returned, she said,--

        "Mr. Twissel, you have been sent for; you are wanted immediately."

        "I -- I sent for?"

        "Yes, sir, you are wanted."

        "Nobody knew I was here.  Oh, yes, I told my clerk as I came along,
confound him!  Just as I was so comfortable, too."

        "We can finish this another time," said the colonel, pointing to the
bottle.

        "Yes, thank you.  Good night, Colonel Deverill."

        "Good evening, Mr. Twissel."

        Mr. Twissel quitted the drawing-room, vowing vengeance to himself
against the brute of a clerk of his, who should dare to come and interrupt
such an agreeable evening.  It was most horribly provoking.  He could have
called down the vengeance of the universe upon the head of the offending
mortal who had come for him, and in this mood of mind he entered the 
parlour.

        "Where is he -- where is he?"

        "Where is who?" inquired Mrs. Meredith.

        "My clerk -- the man who came for me."

        "Listen, Mr. Twissel," said Mrs. Meredith; "I have called you out. 
No
one has been for you; but I had no other means of calling you out, as I 
wanted
to speak to you."

        "Well," said Mr. Twissel, half surprised and half vexed, "what do 
you
want to say to me now I am here."

        "I want to impress upon you the fact, that the habits of the colonel
lead him to retire about this time, and I feared you, not knowing this, 
might
stop beyond the proper moment, and so took this method of telling you what I
am sure you would like to know."

        Mr. Twissel could not object; there was something reasonable in it,
and yet he was at heart vexed, and could not help saying, --

        "I should have thought the colonel would not have been so pleasant 
and
so talkative; if he had not been  comfortable, he would have said so."

        "Oh, dear, no, he would not have done that, even if you had remained
till daylight; he has too much courtesy towards a stranger to do so."

        "Very well," said Twissel, "I will be gone.  However, I will take 
care
and not forget the South Sea House the day after to-morrow.  You must make 
the
best of it you can, and let me know when he is likely to go, so that I may 
not
lose any chance."

        "Certainly not.  I'll do as I did before," said the lady.

        "Do so."

        "And I hope you will meet with better luck than you met with 
before."

        "I hope so too," said the attorney, gravely.  "However, here I am, 
and
I'll do all that I can do for you.  Good by, Mrs. Meredith -- good day -- 
good
night."

        "Good night," said Mrs. Meredith, and the attorney left the house, 
to
their inexpressible relief, for he was growing very talkative and very
troublesome too, for the misfortune was, he more than once touched upon
forbidden topics.

Next Time: The Difficulties to be Encountered in the Choice of a Bridesmaid.




                            CHAPTER CXXVII. [sic]
                            
                                [Chapter 137]

THE DIFFICULTIES TO BE ENCOUNTERED IN THE CHOICE OF A BRIDESMAID.


     "Well, Margaret," said Mrs. Meredith, when they were alone in their own
apartment -- "well, and how have you got on with the colonel?"

     "Oh, very well indeed, ma'."

     "I am glad of it.  Has he proposed anything new to you, my dear, or has
he said anything more to you of a particular character?  Has he said 
anything
respecting property?  That is what we want to know pretty well, and that is
the only point that can be more than usually interesting to us."

     "No, ma', nothing about property.  I could not expect he would say
anything to me, and I hardly expect he would to any one at all.  You see, he
is no doubt a rich man."

     "Well, and he would not consider it at all necessary to say anything
about it to any one; that it is so peculiarly private, and has nothing to do
with any one; and he does not imagine that we require anything of the kind.  
I
am sure if the thought entered his mind, he would at once satisfy us upon 
the
subject.  I cannot speak to him about it, because, having none, I am really
not entitled to do so.  That's my opinion upon the subject, though Mr.
Twissel, I dare say, has a different one to me; indeed, he generally has one
of his own."

     "Yes, you may depend upon that; but I have been thinking the matter 
over,
and I am sure he is what he says he is.  But what did he say, my dear?"

     "Why, he insists that I shall name an early day."

     "Insists!  my child.  What does he mean?"

     "Merely in a good-natured, though urgent manner.  Indeed, he wishes me 
to
make up my mind and have him at once.  If I'll consent to have him, he'll
obtain a special licence to solemnize the marriage here in this house, or at
church, which I like best.  Which shall I consent to, ma'?"

     "Well, my dear, I think you may as well be married at home; it will be 
so
much more fashionable than going to church."

     "It will be much more trouble, and will hardly seem like a marriage, I
think, if it is not done at a church.  What do you think?"

     "It will make more noise," said Mrs.  Meredith, "if it is done at home;
and yet nobody can say a word about it if it takes place at church."

     "So I think, now; so I think."

     "Well, what did you decide?"

     "I did not decide upon anything," said Margaret; "I declined to do so
upon the moment, but said I would think about it, and after a few words, I
promised I would let him know the next time he spoke to me about it, which
should not be before tomorrow afternoon."

     "Very well, my dear.  A becoming reluctance will never hurt your cause;
you have done quite right, and I have no doubt but he will feel more pleased
with you than if you had at once consented upon his first asking."

     "So I thought, ma," sad Margaret.

     "But you must not carry that too far, or it may defeat its own object,
when next he asked you, you must affect a great deal of emotion -- trembling
and blushing, and all that kind of thing, which you can do very well; or if
you should distrust yourself, you can practice it a bit before a glass.  I 
did
it when I was your age, and I did it well."

     "Yes, ma', I can manage all that well enough; but what time shall I
name?"

     "Well, that must in some measure depend upon the humour you find him 
in. 
If he be very pressing, you may shorten the period; if he appear distant,
lengthen it; but if there is any danger, take him at his word at once, and
have no delay.  It will not do to lose a chance; he must not be allowed to 
get
off in that manner; and you must declare your confusion to be so great that
you hardly know what you say, but, as he is so very pressing, you will give 
in
to his wishes, and you may name any day you like best; and then he is 
caught,
you see."

     "I understand that clearly; but what time would you, as a medium time,
give, which I out to lengthen or shorten as occasion may seem to require?"

     "Well, my dear, about a fortnight."

     "Ah, that was on my own tongue, too.  Well, then, I should not have 
done
wrong in naming three weeks or a month, which I felt disposed to say at
first."

     "No, no, but you need not make it more than three weeks, unless you see
any fitting occasion, or any necessity for so doing," said Mrs. Meredith.

                     *           *           *           *        

     After an amiable council the mother and daughter held, having for its
object the entanglement and speedy marrying of the unfortunate East Indian
colonel, they both indulged in balmy sleep, and slept till morn.  The 
colonel
himself said no more about the object of the previous day's conversation, 
when
the amiable mother left the daughter alone with the colonel, who appeared as
if actuated by clock-work; when the hour of his forbearance had passed, he
again spoke of the matter.

     "Miss Meredith," he said, "my impatience will, I hope, be excused, on 
the
score that my love is ardent; and I have already waited as long as I 
promised. 
You know to what I allude."

     "I am afraid I must say I do, Colonel Deverill," said Margaret; "but 
will
you not grant me more time to consider this matter over?  Remember, it is a
serious matter."

     "Of that there is no doubt," said the colonel; "but I do not feel the
same doubts you do, for I only feel how much I can do for your happiness, 
and
how willingly I will do it."

     "Of that I can have no fear."

     "Then why not consent at once?  Consent to have the man who loves you 
who
dotes upon you, and who will do all that an ample fortune can enable him to 
do
for your welfare, and your future prosperity and comfort. Consider all 
that."

     "I have considered much; I don't know that I need consider more than my
present happiness; the future will take care of itself; at all events, we 
can
do no more than to deserve to do well, and to succeed in all our
undertakings-- to deserve to be happy."

     "And do more you cannot; and who is there that can do as much?"

     "We all endeavour to do so."

     "I hope we do so, though I am sure there are many who might do better;
but, to return to my hopes, when will you consent to become mine-- say the
day on which I am to be made happy; and, if you really love me, make it as
short as you can."

     Margaret appeared to hesitate, and hung her head, trembled, and the
blushes mounted her cheek; the colonel caught her in his arms -- and 
pressing
her to his bosom, he said, --

     "Come, come, my own Margaret say when shall I be made happy."

     "Oh!  Deverill," she sighed, as she hid her face; "what shall I say--
you are so urgent; shall I say a-- a fortnight; and yet that is, -- too--
too, soon."

     "No--  no, not at all-- not at all; thank you, dear Margaret, thank 
you."

     "I-- I-- I fear I have said too much; forgive me----"

     "Nay, nay, no more about it; I will be content; to-morrow I will go to
the city, and then I will purchase the wedding-ring.  I will obtain a
licence, and then we shall be ready against any contingencies; and on our
wedding morning, I will have some jewels ready for you.  I have given them
some orders, but they take a long while in getting ready."

     "Oh, you are too good."

     "Not a bit-- only just," said the colonel; and he appeared as though he
were quite satisfied with his conquest, and looked very well pleased with
the success he had met with in the prosecution of his suit.  It was a 
settled
thing now, and he was, or professed to be in extacies.

                     *           *           *           *        

     "Mother," said Margaret as she entered the room, "it is all settled at
last; I have given my consent, and the day is named."

     "Indeed!  I am glad of it.  When will the day arrive-- what day is it?"

     "This day fortnight."

     "This day fortnight!  well-- well, that will be a very good time-- very
good time, indeed; we shall have a very busy time of it, for we must make 
the
most of our arrangements between this and then; for we must get you in a fit
out;  but if you have a dress to appear in, that is as much as I shall be 
able
to afford you, for my means are so short."

     "I know all that; but he has promised me jewels, which he has ordered,
but which will take some time in making; but he expects them to be ready by
our wedding-day.  Come, now, this seems to me to be a very handsome
provision."

     "Very, my dear; very fortunate, too, because you see the furniture was
becoming somewhat less new and fine that it was; that would have compelled 
me
to lessen my terms; so we should have gone gradually back, and, perhaps, 
been
obliged to seek some other mode of living."

     "But you have some money by you?"

     "That was reserved in case of extreme misfortunes, and I cannot realize
that immediately; however, it would only put off the evil day; but we are
saved that, now-- we have caught a rare good fish-- we have only to land 
him,
that is, get some little to be done before we pull him ashore.  We must keep
up the farce; but, I tell you, we must not be guided by Mr. Twissel, though 
he
is of great use."

     "No, ma', we must not; I have thought on that."

     "And yet I do not like to give up the idea of finding out first what he
may have in the shape of property, though I am sure it would do no good; 
yet,
to have one's curiosity satisfied is something gained.  Still, I am not so
curious that I must be satisfied at the expense of our prospects."

     "No, ma'; I am sure I want badly enough to know all about it, but I 
will
restrain my curiosity until I find out by means and at a time when no 
offence
can be taken; or, if it be, why it's of no consequence, and I don't care
anything about it, because I shall have a right to speak for myself."

     "Certainly, my dear, that is a very proper spirit-- a very proper 
spirt,
indeed; but then he won't interfere with you much, except it is to want you 
to
be always at his elbow."

     "Ah, I won't mind that, because, you see, he may make a will; but I'll
take pretty good care that nobody comes in between him and me."

     "Exactly; you have no relatives on his side to tease you, or give you 
any
trouble; therefore you have all plain sailing before you."

     "I have; and now, I suppose, it will not be too much to speak to one's
bridesmaids?"

     "Ah!  my dear," said Mrs. Meredith, with a shake of the head.

     "What's the matter, ma'?"

     "Ah!  my dear, there is the difficulty; you know how easy the colonel 
has
fallen in love with you; how sudden that has all come about, and how short a
time the courtship has continued."

     "So much the better, ma'."

     "Certainly, my love; but it should make you cautious-- very cautious, 
how
you act with bridesmaids, because you don't know what may happen with such 
old
people as the colonel-- they are dreadful, sometimes and you don't know what
they will do.  They will fall in love with anybody; it is quite shocking to
think of it; but it don't so much matter, only you see he may take a violent
fancy to some one, and then you may lose by the whole affair."

     "How so, ma'?"

     "Why, suppose he takes a fancy to one of the bridesmaids? -- you don't
know what may pass between them."

     "Certainly not."

     "Very well; then he may make a will to reward her, as he would call it,
and then you lose so much, which is a clear robbery, as I call it."

     "So it would be, ma'; and yet, after all's said and done, I cannot tell
what else we are to do; some female friends we must have; and the only
precaution we can take will be to get some one as ugly as I can, and then 
keep
her away as much as possible."

     "The latter is the only effectual method, for ugliness is not always a
safeguard, for men have got such tastes, and what we think extremely plain,
they, by a perversity of taste, will persist in believing to be interesting,
at least, if not pretty.  I have known so many instances; besides, I do know
that even ugliness itself is no safeguard."

     "Indeed, ma'!"

     "No; I had an instance of that-- I may say two-- even with your father,
who took a fancy to two of the servants, one after the other.  I am sure 
there
was nothing in the hussies to attract any attention; but then men will be 
men,
and you can't help it."

     "We must get rid of them."

     "Yes, that is all you can do; but whom did you think of having?"

     "There are the two Miss Stewards----"

     "They are called pretty.  I heard a gentleman say so at the last party 
we
went to, so that I think decidedly bad policy.  I know the men's taste very
well, my dear, but it is different to what we call taste; I don't know why,
but it is so."

     "Well, ma', if the Misses Steward won't do, what do you say to the 
Misses
Brown?  They are anything but even passable; besides, they are pitted with 
the
small-pox, and very light hair, almost carroty-- they are anything but
fascinating."

     "That may be all very true, my dear, but you know the Misses Brown 
sing,
they are called good figures, and dashing young women, and they are very 
bold,
which might tempt many people, especially when they are looking about for
sweethearts."

     "Yes, that is very true; then there are the Misses Smith-- they are 
very
young-- much too young to be at all likely to cause men to have any fancy 
for
them."

     "There, my dear innocent girl, you are entirely wrong-- most entirely
wrong."

     "Indeed, ma'?"

     "Yes, my dear, you are innocence itself, because you have been brought 
up
at home; but, look here, men are the nastiest creatures alive -- why, some 
of
them would fall in love with a girl sixteen or seventeen years old.  Aye, 
more
than that, -- I have seen some of them married at that age."

     "Oh!  I am shocked," said Margaret, as she lifted up her hands in
amazement at this description of the vices of men.  "Ah!  well they may say 
at
church, 'And there is no good in us.'"

     "Indeed, my dear, you are quite right, and so is the Prayer-book-- but 
it
is as I tell you; beside, men never forget these things; they will remember
faces they have seen for a year or two, and then they will begin their 
games."

     "Dear me, ma', what shall I do?"

     "That is the difficulty, my dear.  I would not have unfolded this book 
of
vice before you, had it not been necessary for your happiness."

     "Oh!  fiddle de dee ma' -- it's the money that I care for; it ain't the
colonel, poor old cripple.  He may do as he pleases, as long as I get the
gold."

     "Well, my dear," said the careful mother, who felt the sedative effects
of this speech, "well, my dear, but you know they do waste their means in
these affairs, and that most outrageously, sometimes, to cause a ruinous
effect upon their home."

     "Oh!  but he's too much of an invalid."

     "Do you know, Margaret, I think the colonel is more of an invalid from
habit than reality.  Sometimes, when nobody's looking, he can walk and use
both feet alike, and even use his left hand without any trouble at all."

     "Do you really think so?"

     "Yes, but I don't mean to say it is all sham.  Oh, dear, no, but long
habit, and the laziness of these rich Indians is so great, that there is no
knowing its extent.  I don't believe they would eat, if it wasn't for their
being hungry."

     "What is to be done?"

     "I will tell you, my dear.  Have Miss Twissel and her friend."

     "Miss Twissel and Martha Briggs," exclaimed Miss Meredith with a
giggle.  "What a fright!"

     "So much the better, my dear-- so much the better.  It is just what you
want-- the very thing above all others.  Have a fool and a fright, and you 
can
drop their acquaintance whenever you like, and I think there can be no 
danger
of the colonel's falling in love with them.  At least," added Mrs. Meredith,
with emphasis, -- "at least, upon such an occasion."

     "Very well, ma'.  Let it be Miss Twissel and Martha Briggs.  Goodness 
me,
how I shall be attended upon this occasion-- it will be quite laughable. I
mustn't let the colonel see them before the morning arrives, else he will be
sure to laugh at them."

     "Ha!  ha!  ha!" laughed both mother and daughter at the idea of the two
frights, as they called them, being bridesmaids; and in high good humour 
they
both retired to rest for the night, to dream of the forthcoming occasion.

Next Time: Mr. Twissel's Misfortunes, and His Resolution Never to Give In.




                            CHAPTER CXXVIII. [sic]

                                [Chapter 138]

MR. TWISSEL'S MISFORTUNES, AND HIS RESOLUTION NEVER TO GIVE IN.


     The next day after that on which the conversation respecting the choice
of a bridesmaid took place, was the day on wihch the colonel was to visit 
the
South Sea House.

     Early that morning he ordered a coach to be in attendance, and left the
house, saying that he would be back in time for tea; that he had to make
several purchases, and transact some necessary business that would occupy 
him
until that time.  He kissed Margaret, and whispered in her ear that he 
should
call and see about the jewels, and urge the jeweller to get them ready.

     "These people are so dilatory," he said, "that, unless I worry them, 
they
will disappoint me of them; and I would not be without them on the occasion 
of
our marriage for a trifle."

     "We must not set our happiness upon such things," said Margaret.

     "Ah, what self-denial you can exert!" said the colonel, playfully.

     "No; my happiness is not fixed upon such objects as those, and,
therefore, it is no trouble to renounce them when it is necessary to do so."

     "I hope there will be no need.  I believe there will be none; but good
bye till teatime, and then we shall pass a pleasant evening together."

     The colonel left the house, and no sooner had he done so, than Mrs.
Meredith wrote a short note to Mr. Twissel, informing him of the colonel's
departure at a much eariler hour than she had anticipated.

     "Here, Mary," she said to the drudge.

     "Yes, ma'am," replied the domestic.

     "Just run as fast as you can to Mr. Twissel with this note, and don't 
let
the grass grow under your feet.  Do you hear?"

     "Yes, ma'am."

     Away went the drudge as fast as she could to the man of law, and 
arrived
there out of breath; and having gone there fast, according to orders, she
thought herself at liberty to take her own time in going back, which she
performed to perfection.

     Mr. Twissel cursed himself for this unexpected departure; but there was
no time for deliberation.  He crushed on his hat, took a coach, and drove as
hard as the mysteriously-kept-up cattle cold carry it, and was fortunate
enough to see the colonel go by in another.  He jumped out, paid the jarvey,
and then made a rush after the colonel, whom he saw going up the steps.

     Determined that he would not be outdone this time, he rushed through a
crowd of men who were near at hand, and jostled them so, that they gave him
more oaths than was consistent with courtesy, and one of them desired to 
know
if he were running after himself or anybody else.

     Heedless of this, he pushed on, and trod upon a bricklayer's foot so
hard, that the man gave a great shout, and, by way of retaliation, brought 
his
heavy hand down so hard upon the attorney's hat, that the article of wearing
apparel was forced below his chin, much to the detriment of his vision, 
which
was totally eclipsed.

     In an instant he was struggling with his hat, and yet was unable to
release himself from the durance in which his head was held; but he found 
this
was not all he had to contend with, for he felt himself pushed and hustled
about in a strange manner, till he was thrown on a door step, and then he 
was
suddenly left to himself, with no soul near him.

     "Upon my word, this must be done on purpose, I do verily believe," said
Mr. Twissel, as he at length succeeded in wrenching his hat off his head,
after many violent efforts; but even then it was at the expense of the 
lining
and skin off his nose, which was a very disagreeable affair, after all.

     Mr. Twissel, for a moment or two, stared round him, and wondered where 
he
was, until, at length, upon some examination, he found himself round the
corner.

     "Oh, I must have got hustled round the corner-- yes, yes, I see how it
is; it's a down-right conspiracy of theirs-- there can't be two minds."

     But then, again, he thought what conspiracy could there be necessary to
marry a girl without money?  If she had money, he could have understood it,
but not as the matter stood -- that was quite impossible.  It was an
impenetrable mystery.

     As these thoughts passed through his mind, he was sitting on the step 
of
a door, and, seeing the blood trickle off his nose in vermillion drops upon
the pavement, he felt for his handkerchief to wipe the injured feature, and
stop the bleeding.

     But, alas! it was not in this pocket, nor in that; it was not in his 
hat
-- he never carried it there; if he had, his head would never have reached 
the
crown of his hat -- that was quite certain; it would have been better had he
done so.

     But, as it was not about him, where could it be?  He knew that he had 
had
it before he left home on this errand;  the truth, however, was not long
before it came across his mind like a flash of light.  He had got among a 
gang
of London thieves, who had hustled and robbed him of his handkerchief.

     This was suggestive of other matters, and he, in consequence, put his
hand to his watch-fob, but also that was gone, too.  He gasped -- felt his
breeches pocket, and then he sank back, for he found his garments had been
slit open by some sharp instrument, and his purse had fled.

     "D---n!" said the attorney, in a fury; but this subsided in a moment.
The loss he had felt, and the pushing about he had experienced, was too 
much;
he felt weakened and disheartened, and paused to think upon what he should 
do,
and which way he should go.

     "It's no use giving in," he muttered; "no use at all.  I must go on.  
And
yet, I had better go and see if the coach is gone, for if it is still there-
-
and it can't have gone away yet-- I'll yet go in and see if I can find him."

     He walked round the corner, much shaken with what he had received in 
the
way of knocks and kicks, but when he did get round, he saw the coach was 
gone. 
There was, however, a ticket-porter at hand, and he determined to go and ask
him a few questions.

     "My friend," he said, feeling in his pocket; "do you know a Colonel
Deverill?"

     "No," said the man; "never heard of him-- where does he live?"

     "He came in here just now."

     "Ah, did he?" replied the man, kicking a piece of orange peel off the
pavement; "I don't know him."

     "Do you recollect a hackney-coach coming up to the door just now, with 
a
lame gentleman, who got out?"

     "Yes; with a green shade over his eye."

     "Yes-- that was the man."

     "Oh, well, I never seed him afore-- I don't know him-- he didn't stop a
minute."

     "Oh!" said Mr. Twissel, and then he turned away, and walked towards his
own house.  However, he felt in his pocket for some money; a small sum in
silver was loose in his pockets, and this he had saved, and he determined to
treat himself to some brandy-and-water, for he was really much knocked 
about,
and terrified and nervous, so he went into the first public-house he came 
to.

     This was a low house, the parlour of which was situated a long way 
back,
and he walked in and threw himself into a seat.

     "Well, well; here I am.  This is disaster the second.  Well, who would
have believed I should have met with such misadventures as those I have just
gone through?  There's a fate in it.  I am sure this is an unlucky business
altogether-- of that I am certain.  I got into the watchhouse on the first
occasion, but now I am worse than that; I have been knocked about and robbed
of money and goods-- fifteen pounds in my purse-- confound Colonel Deverill, 
I
say."

     "What will you take, sir?"

     "Eh?" inquired the bewildered attorney, who forgot that he had entered 
a
public-house, and the waiter was desiring to know what he wished to have.

     "What will you like to take, sir?" inquired the waiter, again.

     "A glass of brandy-and-water, and a biscuit."

     The man left the room, and Twissel retired within himself to 
contemplate
the evils he had suffered, and those he was likely to endure.

     "Well, I never thought I was in such a thing as this.  Who would ever
have believed it?  None, I am sure-- no one could.  Confound them!  I'll 
give
it up as a bad job, and a bad job it has been for me, I am quite confident 
of
that."

     "Brandy-and-water, and a biscuit," said the waiter, laying down the
articles enumerated, and Twissel gave the necessary cash, accompanied by the
customary gratuity, which ranges from ten to twenty-five per cent upon the
money paid for the articles purchased.

     We have often thought this a most exorbitant tax upon those who require
accomodation.  If people cannot pay their own servants, they ought not to 
keep
them; to be sure, you are told you need not pay anything -- it is entirely
voluntary, and that they do not wish it; but you only obtain a flippant
answer, so as to attract every one's eyes in the place, and the end of it 
is,
if there is much business, you don't get any attention at all.

     "Well, I won't give in," said Mr. Twissel, with a thump on the table; 
but
he had drank nearly two-thirds of the brandy-and-water.

     "No, I won't give in."

     He swallowed down the remainder, finished the biscuit, and leaned back 
in
his seat, and then he began to talk to himself.

     "I will not give in; after all that has passed, it would be a shame to 
be
done, robbed, beaten, and kicked; and then give in-- nonsense!  I will go
through the whole affair, and that shall repay me in the end.  I'll lay it 
on
the thicker for this."

     This was a comfortable resolution on the part of Mr. Twissel, and which
appeared to please him well, for he smiled quietly, and then rose much
refreshed and left the house.

     This last allusion of Twissel's was consolatory, and had an intimate
connection with certain imaginary charges he would make to the Deverill 
family
when he got the business; but as that was a matter buried in the womb of
futurity, we will not follow him in his speculations.

     "I won't give in," he said, as he walked on, and thrust his hand into 
the
slit that had been cut in his trousers to extract his purse; but this only
confirmed him in his resolution, and he uttered again and again, "I won't 
give
in."

     "I won't give in," he murmured, as he sought the knocker of Mrs.
Meredith's door.  "I won't give in-- I'm not a man whose resolution is 
easily
shaken.  Oh, dear, no; I'll tell my good friend, Mrs. Meredith, all my
troubles, and then ask her what she thinks of me-- if I ain't an 
indefatigable
friend, one who will never sink under difficulties.

 Next Time: Mrs. Meredith Has a Conversation with Mr. Twissel. -- The
 Announcement, and the Invitation.




                            CHAPTER CXXIX. [sic]

                               [Chapter 139]

MRS. MEREDITH HAS A CONVERSATION WITH MR. TWISSEL. -- THE ANNOUNCEMENT, AND
THE INVITATION.


     When the servant answered the knock, Mr. Twissel learned, to his severe
disappointment, that Mrs. Meredith was from home; and he was about to turn
from the door, after leaving his name, when the girl said that her mistress
had left a message, the purport of which was, that if he, Mr. Twissel, was 
to
call, she would feel obliged by his awaiting her return, as her absence 
would
be but short, and the subject upon which she wished to see him was one of
particular importance.

     Mr. Twissel was shown into the parlour much about the same as usual; 
but
he himself was somewhat of a different state.  He himself was considerably
disgusted with his share of the business; but, as we have before stated, he
was resolved never to give in; no, he was resolved to carry it on to the 
end.

     "It must come to a wind-up somehow or other, and at some time or other;
but, at the same time, as I have taken so much interest in that I am 
resolved
to see it out, I won't lose all I have lost for nothing; it shall be with me 
a
neck or nothing affair; and, however aggravating it may be, you will have a
greater chance in the long run of coming off victorious."

     Several minutes passed away, and still Mrs. Meredith came not.  At 
length
the attorney began to grow somewhat impatient, and he looke around the
apartment, as if to find some object to pass away the time until her 
arrival.
On a table in the centre of the room lay several books, and he opened one or
two of them for the purpose of ascertaining the nature of the contents.  The
title of one of them attracted his attention; it consisted of a collection 
of
tales of the supernatural, and he opened it upon a legend called "The Dead 
Not
Dead."  It possessed considerable interest, and Twissel was soon lost in its
details.  It ran as follows: --

     The moon, with her train of glittering satellites following with silent
grandeur in her wake, is sailing, in lustrous glory, through the heavens, 
and
shedding such a flood of light over the face of nature, that the mountains 
and
trees look as if some mighty hand had tinted them with silver.

     Our scene is a rocky pass amidst the stupendous Appenines-- one of the
wildest, and yet most beautiful of that romantic region.

     At the foot of a tree, and on a spot on which the rays of the moon fall
with all their power, sits a young man, who is evidently watching over what
appears to be a dead body that lies prostrate at his feet.  His head is
resting on his hand, and he is regarding the form before him with mingled 
fear
and determination.

     Hark! he speaks!  What are his words?

     "For full an hour have the rays of yonder luminary poured their 
radiance
upon the ghastly features of my dead master, and yet there is no effect
visible.  Surely he must have been labouring under some fearful delusion of
mind, and the dreadful compact of which he has spoken had existence but in 
his
imagination.  I certainly had some little faith in the existence of those
scourges to mankind-- vampyres, but now, I am inclined to think, my faith 
will
be terribly shaken.  In God's name, I hope it may."

     The moon rose higher and higher, until, as she reached her zenith,
everything was so bathed in her gentle light, that scarcely a shadow was
thrown around, save by the tall pines that were scattered here and there 
upon
the face of the rocks.

     Suddenly there was a movement in the form of the dead man -- a 
spasmodic
jerk of the whole muscles of the frame, as if a galvanic battery had been
applied to it; and then the eyes slowly opened, though at first there was 
but
little or no expression in them.

     The young man started to his feet with an exclamation of horror, and
stood glaring upon the form with fixed and protruding eyes, his limbs
trembling, and every feature distorted with mental agony.

     "Holy mother of God!" he murmured, in a low tone, "he moves! he moves!
The terrible compact is too true."

     At this moment, though there was not the slightest appearance of a 
cloud
in the whole heavens, mutterings of thunder were heard, and the lightning 
was
seen playing around the tree-tops with a pale and sickly glare.  The young
man, so intensely was his attention fixed upon the corpse at the foot of the
tree, did not notice this phenomena; and he was at length horrified at
beholding a ball of blue fire dart from the air, and glide inot the ground
immediately at the head of him whom he had named as his master.  Then there
was a loud explosion, and a glare of light so broad and strong that the
watcher of the dead was obliged to veil his eyes with his hands, and he 
could
scarcely tell for some moments whether he were deprived of his sight or not.

     When he opened his eyes again, it was with a start of surprise, for,
before him, with his arms folded on his breast, and regarding him with a 
calm
and untroubled countenance, stood his master; while the moonlight streamed 
out
upon the landscape, and as great a silence as when he lay in death upon the
ground reigned around.

     "Oh, signor," he at length stammered, in broken tones -- "my vigil has
been one of the most terrible---"

     "Silence, Spalatro," said the resuscitated one, in a deep and hollow
voice -- "silence.  Not a word, now or henceforth, must pass your lips
respecting what you have seen to night.  Breathe but a syllable of what I am
to a human being, and naught on earth shall hide you from my vengeance."

     Spalatro bowed before his master in obedience, while his frame gave a
shudder of horror, as he regarded the deathly appearance that still lingered
in the signor's features.

     "Spalatro," resumed the signor, after a slight pause, "you have 
rendered
me great and faithful service, and your reward has been proportionate; but
there is yet another service which I would seek at your hands.  The Lady
Oriana, for the possession of whom the Signor Fracati and I have fought, and
for whose sake I received the wound which deprived me for a time of life, is
at Florence, and at present ignorant of the mishap that befel me.  The 
Signor
Fracati and yourself are the only persons who are aware of it.  He will 
carry
to Florence the news of my death; and, on my re-appearance before the Lady
Oriana, what tale can I invent to satisfy her?  No, no-- he must not reach
Florence-- he must never look upon the Lady Oriana again.  You, Spalatro, 
wear
a poniard, you have a powerful hand-- and you know well where to strike.  
Rid
me of this hated rival, and wealth shall be yours."

     Spalatro stood rooted to the spot while the signor spoke, and an
expression of mingled horror and disgust crossed his countenance as the 
latter
proceeded.  When the signor had concluded, he stepped a pace or two back, 
and
in a tone full of indignation, said, --

     "Signor Waldeberg, I am no assassin; my poniard is yet guiltless of
shedding human blood.  I saw you receive what was thought to be a mortal 
wound
in honourable combat with the Signor Fracati, and in these arms I beheld you
sink in death.  You had extorted from me a promise that after a certain 
lapse
of time I would convey your body to this vast solitude, and lay it where the
moonbeams should fall upon it; for that then life should once more revisit
you.  All this I have done, and faithfully; I feared to fail in my promise,
for I knew the penalty you would pay if you failed to fulfil the conditions 
of
your compact.  But, signor, I am now no longer bound to you; you have
commenced a fresh existence, which you would baptise with blood; you have
passed the portals of death, and I will no longer serve you.  I will seek
another service and another master, who will require less at my hands, 
though
his pay may be lighter.  Farewell, signor, and better thoughts to you."

     Spalatro turned upon his heel as he spoke, and with a hasty wave of his
hand was leaving the spot, when the signor drew a pistol from a belt that 
was
fastened round his waist, and, exclaiming, "He knows too much respecting me 
to
be suffered to live," fired it full at the head of the young man.  The 
latter
uttered a yell of agony which echoed loudly amid the awful silence, and fell
lifeless on the earth.  When the smoke from the pistol had cleared away, 
that
lonely spot was deserted save by the body of Spalatro, whose blood, 
streaming
upon the ground, reflected the moonbeams with a dull red glare.

                   *             *             *             *

     When the morning sun broke over the mountain tops, its rays fell upon 
the
form of the still insensible Spalatro.  It was but seldom that any 
footsteps,
save those of the wolf or the goat, left their impress on those rocks, and 
it
was almost a miracle that the body of the unfortunate man was not left a 
prey
to the former.

     About an hour after daybreak, the bells of a string of mules were heard
in the distance, accompanied by the cheerful song of the muleteer.  A short
time sufficed to bring the cavalcade to the spot, where lay the body of
Spalatro, and the muleteer, with a cry of alarm, brought his train to a 
stop.
Finding that life still remained, the humane mountaineer raised him from the
ground, placed him across one of the mules, and then hastened foward to the
next inn, which, however, was at some miles distance.

     On arriving there, he found that the only apartment was occupied by a
signor and his daughter, who, however, when the condition of the wounded man
was made known to them, instantly relinquished it to him, and, after seeing
his wounds looked to, ascertained that no mortal result was to be feared, 
and
giving orders that he should want for no attention that money could procure,
they pursued their journey.

     It was many weeks before Spalatro recovered, and when he did regain his
strength, he learned, with a feeling of deep gratitude, that the lady who 
had
been so instrumental in his recovery was no other than the Signora Oriana.  
In
an instant a vow was upon his lips that he would save her from the power of
the fearful monster, whose only mission now on earth, seemed but to destroy
the most beautiful of nature's creation.  With this purpose fixed in his 
mind,
he one morning bid adieu to the residents of the little inn, and set off on
his self-imposed errand.

                *           *           *           *           *

     Some days after the scene we have described as occurring on that lonely
mountain pass, a report reached Florence, where the Signora Oriana was then
staying with her father, that the Signor Fracati had met his death at the
hands of a bravo, and that his body had been discovered stabbed in 
innumerable
places.  The grief of Oriana was intense, for she held the signor in great
estimation, and she would have had but little hesitation in bestowing upon 
him
her hand, if her father's consent could but have been gained to the union.
Signor Vivaldi, however, had been captivated by the great wealth, personal
appearance, and captivating manners of the Signor Waldeberg, and he had 
fixed
his mind upon him becoming the husband of his daughter.

     Weeks passed away, and the memory of the murdered Fracati was gradually
fading from the mind of Oriana.  The respectful yet warm attentions of
Waldeberg won upon a young and innocent heart that had always felt a slight
esteem for him, and as she knew that her father's happiness in a great 
measure
depended upon her consent to the union, it was at length given with a 
freedom
that brought joy to the old man's heart.

     It was arranged that the ceremony should take place at a chateau
belonging to Waldeberg, in the neighbourhood of Lucca, whither it was 
resolved
at once to proceed; and for this purpose Signor Vivaldi and his daughter,
accompanied by Waldeberg, left Florence for that city.

     As they were passing through the gates, a monk, with his cowl drawing
carefully over his face, stepped hastily up to the carriage window, and,
thrusting a letter into the hands of Oriana, as hastily disappeared.

     With some surprise, she opened it and read it, and then a paleness
overspread her countenance, and she sank back in her seat almost insensible.
Her father snatched the paper from her trembling hand, and hastily glancing
over its contents, with a look of anger, handed it to the Signor Waldeberg.

     "See, signor, what some meddling fool, envious of your happiness, has
done to alarm my daughter's fears.  Does he deem us so grossly superstitious
as to believe in such children's tales?"

     The signor took the paper, which he found to run thus: --

     "SIGNORA, -- A grateful heart warns you.  Wed not the murderer of 
Fracati
-- wed not him who, once returned from death to life, seeks but your hand to
provide a victim for the purpose of prolonging a hateful existence.  If you
despise this warning, at any rate, postone the ceremony but for seven days
from hence, and then his power of injuring you will have departed from him."

     "Do you know the writer, signor?" asked Vivaldi.

     "It is evidently the handwriting of a servant of mine, whom I dismissed
for insolence some few weeks since," returned Waldeberg, a shade of vexation
evidently passing across his brow; "and he now takes this means of
endeavouring to obtain his revenge.  But I will take means of having him
punished."

     They now endeavoured to soothe the agitation of Oriana, but the 
incident
seemed to have taken a firm hold upon her imagination, and, in spite of all
their efforts, she found it impossible to shake off the effect it had upon
her.

     The chateau, the place of their destination, was at length reached;
preparations were instantly commenced for the celebration of the marriage,
which was to take place, by the Signor Waldeberg's express desire, on the
sixth day from that on which they had left Florence.  As the day drew near,
the spirits of Oriana grew gradually depressed, and a slight feeling of 
dread
seemed to steal over her, whenever she found herself in the presence of her
lover.  Her father questioned her as to its cause, and then she confessed 
that
the mysterious warning she had received preyed deeply on her mind.  It might
be a superstitious weakness, but she could not repress it; and she requested
her father, however reluctant he might be, to consent to put it off for at
least another day.

     The entreaties of his daughter, though he laughed at her fears, 
prevailed
upon the old man, and he gave his consent to her request; but when he
mentioned the alteration in the time to Waldeberg, the countenance of the
latter underwent a complete change to the hue of death.  No prayer, however,
could prevail upon the old man to recal [sic] his consent to his daughter's
wish, and the signor departed evidently in a state of the greatest despair.

     That night the Signora Oriana was missing from her chamber, and though
the strictest search was made for her, not the least trace of her presence
could be found.  The grief of the father and the lover knew no bounds, and
there seemed to be no hope of consolation for them.

                   *             *             *             *

     It is the night of the sixth day -- that day against which Oriana had
been so mysteriously warned.  In a large vault, far beneath the chateau, and
lighted by innumerable torches, that threw a red and smoky glare around, 
stood
the beautiful Oriana and the Signor Waldeberg.  The former was pale as 
marble,
and an expression of the most intense despair was upon her countenance.

     The signor, resolved that she should become his wife before the
expiration of the six days, had torn her from her chamber, and immured her 
in
that fearful place, with the hope of forcing her to become his bride; but
Oriana revolted at such usage, and feeling more convinced than ever that the
warning she had received had its foundation in truth, had resisted alike his
persuasions and his threats.

     The hour of midnight was fast approaching, and before an altar that 
stood
at one end of the vault, was an old and venerable priest, with an open book 
in
his hand.  Waldeberg drew Oriana towards him, and forced her to kneel at the
foot of the altar.  She entreated -- she supplicated -- she appealed to the
priest; his only answer was a solemn shake of the head, and then he 
proceeded
to read the marriage ceremony.  Waldeberg took her hand -- but she suddenly
flung it from her, and uttered the most piercing screams that echoed 
fearfully
amidst those cavernous places.  Still the priest read on, and despite her
emotion and her agony of terror, Waldeberg regarded her with a cold and
determined gaze.

     "Faster! faster!" he muttered to the priest, "or all will be lost!" and
he glanced anxiously around the vault.

     At the moment, stiking fearfully on the silence, came the sound of the
turret clock telling the hour of midnight.  On the first stroke, the most
fearful sounds the human ear ever listened to filled the place -- strange
indefinite shadows flitted around, filling the air with a rushing sound, as 
if
of mighty wings -- the altar changed to a heap of human bones -- the priest 
to
a ghastly skeleton.  Then came darkness, terrible and distinct; and Oriana
swooned upon the damp floor.

     When she recovered, she found the day had broken, and the sunlight was
streaming upon her face; while her father and the young man whom she had 
seen
wounded at the inn on the mountains were stooping over her in alarm.

     The inhabitants of the chateau had been alarmed in the dead of the 
night
by a terrific storm, which had thrown into ruins a part of the castle, and a
vast chasm had been made in the foundations, disclosing the vaults, the
existence of which had been until then unknown.

     Beneath the rich vestments of Waldeberg, and lying in a heap on the
ground, were the remains of a human skeleton -- all that was now left of the
guilty being who had thus paid the penalty for failing in complying with the
conditions of the fearful compact into which he had entered with the unholy
powers of darkness.

     It was many months before the mind of Oriana recovered its strength, 
and
when it did, she entered a convent of Ursuline nuns, and endeavoured to
forget, in the consolations fo religion, the fearful trial she had 
undergone.

                   *             *             *             *
     Twissel laid down the book which he had been reading, and fell into a
strange kind of musing, in which the vampyre, Waldeberg, and the East India
colonel were strangely mixed up together.  From this reverie he was awakened
by a rap at the street-door, and then, in a few minutes afterwards, Mrs.
Meredith entered the room, exclaiming, --

     "Well, Mr. Twissel, you always come in luck's way."

     "Indeed!" said Mr. Twissel, involuntarily thinking of what he had that
morning undergone, as well as what he went through a day or two before; and,
for the life of him, he saw not what might be called luck, unless it was 
that
species known as ill-luck.

     "Yes, Mr. Twissel, you are; you've just come in time to hear the news."

     "What news, ma'am-- what news?  If you'll be pleased to enlighten me 
upon
that subject, I shall be better able to understand what you allude to."

     "Why, you see, the colonel has been so pressing, that my daughter has
been induced to name the day.  Yes, Mr. Twissel, she has named the day-- not 
a
distant day either.  He begged and entreated you don't know how hard, which,
at least, shows how much he meant it."

     "Well, truly, it is news, Mrs. Meredith," said the attorney; "but, at 
the
same time, it is what I expected, though not just at this juncture.  The 
fact
is, there is but little can be said against Colonel Deverill; but, at the 
same
time, there will be but little said for him.  I am by no means sure that 
there
will be any property found.  If he were a man of money, he would not 
hesitate
to lay his circumstances open."

     "He is too proud a man for that."

     "Well, it may be all very well to attribute it to that cause.  However
that may be, there can be no doubt you have a right to do as you please, and 
I
bow to you decision; but, still, I do so, having expressed my opinion to the
contrary, being very suspicious of him.  But, as I said before, you are
entitled to do what you please in the affair; I have no right to do more."

     "My daughter and I have been considering the matter over and over 
again,
and we have come to the conclusion that it should take place, and she has
consented that it should take place in about ten days' time, when we shall
expect to have your company, Mr. Twissel."

     "I am obliged to you, and assure you my opinions upon this matter are 
not
at all personal.  I will meet the colonel, and I will be present with you 
all
on that happy occasion with much pleasure; and I hope it will be a fortunate
and happy marriage."

     "I hope so, too," said Mrs. Meredith; "and I have every reason to 
believe
so."

     "That is good," said the attorney.

     "And now, Mr. Twissel," said Mrs. Meredith, "what did you do this 
morning
at the South Sea House?  I could not send to you so early as I could have
wished, as I did not know he ws going till the coach was ordered, and he 
went
away almost immediately.  I then sent Mary to you; I don't know at what time
she came to you, but at all events she was not back here until late."

     "She must have got to my place in good time, if she only started after
the colonel had left this house," said the attorney.

     "I am very glad of that, at all events; but what success did you have?"

     "Success, indeed," said Mr. Twissel, with a shrug of mortification.  "I
have only succeeded in getting myself into a very serious difficulty, and 
the
colonel has eluded me again.  I can't understand it all.  I don't know what 
to
think; but I am sure of this, that I have been in a series of disasters ever
since I undertook to follow him about, and I have discovered nothing
concerning him."

     "What has happened to you to-day, then?" inquired Mrs. Meredith.

     "Oh! as for that, what seems to be but natural in itself; and, 
therefore,
it may be said not to be connected with him; indeed, though that were really
the case, yet there is so much concurrent action, I cannot divest myself of
the idea that it is a fatal affair, as far as regards looking after him."

     "Then don't do so any more, Mr. Twissel."

     "I'll never give in," said Twissel.

     "Well, but what need you trouble yourself more about the affair?  I
assure you we're all well satisfied that Colonel Deverill is Colonel 
Deverill,
and that he had property; that being the case, I am sure you have nothing to
trouble yourself about, or to blame yourself for."

     "I am conscious of that," said the attorney, rubbbing his knee.  "I 
have
done all I can; and I have given my advice-- I hope I have done my part."

     "Yes, you have," said Mrs. Meredith.  "I am quite satisfied; but what 
has
happened to you?"

     "I will tell you, my dear madam-- I will tell you.  I have been
assaulted, knocked about, robbed, and my faculties all confused, and no use 
to
me.  I have lost my handerkerchief, watch, and purse; and I have had my
trowsers ripped open; and I can't tell what besides.  I am safe, however."

     "Well, that is right, at all events; but it is most annoying to me that
you should be subject to those terrible accidents.  I can't understand the
meaning of it."

     "I can't," said the attorney.

     "But why should you, more than any one else, be subject to these
misfortunes?  I can't understand it at all, Mr. Twissel.  Perhaps you do
something or other unusual on such occassions, which had been the cause of
such terrible trouble."

     "Not that I am aware of," said Twissel; "but the fact is, I don't know 
of
anything peculiar in my appearance or behaviour, that should cause this
disaster.  But I am sure of this, that there is nothing more singular about
me, than what there usually is; and why it should only attract notice on 
these
occasions and no other, I cannot tell."

     "Nor I.  Well, I suppose it must have been there was some other
circumstance, independent alike of him and you, that had caused this
diagreeable affair."

     "Perhaps there might be."

     "Well, now, Mr. Twissel, there's another affair I wish to speak to you
about; or, rather, it's a thing my daughter Margaret should speak to your
daughter Elizabeth and Miss Martha about.  You see, as they are not very 
often
together, I thought it right to speak to you first."

     "Yes, ma'am-- go on, pray."

     "Well, my Margaret is to be married in a few days.  Now, we don't want
relatives at all; and I was advising her to beg your permission to have the
two young ladies whom I have named, as bridesmaids, and who will be of
essential service to my daughter."

     "I have no doubt but they will feel very much gratified with the
proposal; and one could not have been better devised than this one to please
them."

     "Then, will you invite them to come here, and spend the evening with
Margaret and yourself, Mr. Twissel, the first evening you find leisure and
inclination?"

     "Well, I have destroyed to-day, so far as a business day, by drinking
brandy-and-water early, and I may as well finish it in an agreeable manner."

     "That is very good; we shall expect you to tea this evening."

     "You may," said Mr. Twissel; "if you are not otherwise engaged.  I may 
as
well do all that is necessary, so as to have as little to do, by-and-bye, as
possible.  Has the colonel come home?"

     "No, not yet; I did not expect him to come home so soon as this, but he
will be back in a very short time, now, I dare say."

     "Then I will bid you good bye, for it will be unnecessary to meet him 
in
this plight; indeed, he might think I paid him no respect to do so; and
besides it will be better, altogether, that he should not see me so soon, 
lest
he should have caught sight of me in the city; which, indeed, I think wholly
impossible, for I only had a distant glimpse of him."

     "Then, good bye, sir; I shall see you and the young ladies."

     "Both-- my daughter, and her young friend, Martha."

     Mr. Twissel arose, and left the house to return to his own house, and 
get
his daughter prepared for the visit, and her friend also, while Mrs. 
Meredith
and her daughter, Margaret, consulted together, as to what would be the best
method of doing honour to the occasion of the forthcoming marriage.

     "You see, my dear," said Mrs. Meredith, "we cannot very well invite our
own friends, because they are such a greedy, rapacious set; they would 
sooner
spoil a good chance for us than let us have it unmolested; they are by far 
too
greedy-- no, no, they must not come-- they will think themselves injured if
they cannot share the harvest."

     "And all will be lost."

     "To be sure; and, moreover, we could not shake them off when we wanted,
and which we must do very soon, for the colonel will never abide them."

     "No, ma' I think not, indeed-- they are decidedly low people, who are
genteel only of a Sunday; it will never do to have such people about us."

     "Oh, dear, no."

     "Here is the colonel come back; see if that girl has got the water hot,
he will like his tea early; I am quite sure she hasn't got it ready-- what a
provoking girl that is, to be sure.  She does nothing all day; I must get 
rid
of her."

     "Yes; but she is very ugly."

     "That is one great recommendation in her favour," said Mrs. Meredith;
"one very great recommendation; it ensures domestic peace, to say the least 
of
it, and there's not so many followers usually.  Now, however, we must do the
best until we have mone; but here he is."

     At that moment the colonel entered the house, and proceeded at once to
the drawing-room, having first divested himself of his hat and cloak in the
passage.  Up stairs was a good fire and an easy chair, with ottomans for his
feet, and a comfortable well furnished apartment it was.

     Mrs. Meredith followed him up and entered the room after him, to 
inquire
what he would like done next; and with her assistance, he took his boots off
and put on a pair of splendid slippers, and reposed with a groan of
satisfaction on the chair.

     "I think, Mrs. Meredith," he said, "that the best thing I can have will
be some tea.  Where is Margaret? when she is at liberty, I wish to see and
speak to her."

     "She will be here in a few moments, colonel," said Mrs. Meredith; "I 
will
send her to you."

     "No hurry for a few moments," said the colonel.

     "Something about the jewels, I'll be sworn," said Mrs. Meredith, to
herself; "I wonder what he has in that parcel; a present, I dare say."

     Mrs. Meredith sought Margaret, and related what the colonel said, with
his desire to see her, and that young lady at once proceeded to the drawing-
room.

     "Oh, my dear Margaret," said Colonel Deverill, "I see you are pleased 
to
see I have returned; your very eyes tell me so.  Come here to me, dearest."

     "Ah, my looks, I am afraid, say too much."

     "Not at all-- not at all," said the colonel; "I love to see them,
especially when I know they are sincere, wehen they come from the heart, you
know; I love to see innocent and heartfelt satisfaction beaming from such a
face as yours."

     "Oh, colonel, you are really too complimentary; not that I think you
don't mean what you say, but your partiality is too great to allow you to
judge as a stranger would."

     "I do not desire to judge as a stranger would; it does not give me any
satisfaction.  To look upon you with the eyes of a lover, is a privilege I
most desire, and very soon with those of a husband; then my happiness will 
be
complete.  How I long for the days and the hours to fly by-- they cannot go
too fast now; by and bye they may pass as slowly as you please-- that done,
then I am quite content, because I shall pass them happily, rapturously."

     "Ah, you are so kind-hearted, so good, that I can never repay you."

     "Do not seek to do so, you will only make me the heavier in debt; but
come, there is a small parcel, with a few trinkets I have purchased; the
jewels I spoke of are in hand, and they will be ready in time for our
marriage."

     "Nay, do not think about them-- not to disturb yourself, colonel; I am
quite content if I am dressed as befits the occasion; but I am really 
obliged
to you for your present, whatever it may be; and I may as well tell you I 
have
thought-- indeed, I have said as much-- I should like to have a couple of
female friends to visit me on that occasion."

     "Yes, my dear, you may depend upon it, I shall be the more happy when I
know you are so too; but no matter, ask whom you please; as far as I am 
able,
I will make them welcome and happy.  I suppose, however, you are alluding to
your bridesmaids."

     "I am," said Margaret.

     "I shall be most happy to see them, or any friend you may desire," 
added
the colonel.

     "And will you have no one on the occasion?" inquired Margaret; "won't 
you
have somebody to keep you in countenance upon the occasion?"

     "No," said the colonel, "I shall not; I have no friends with whom I am
intimate enough, that I know of, at this present moment; there may be people
in London, with whom I have been, in India, intimate with, but I do not know
for certain; but time and accident will turn up old friends, and I have not
the desire to seek for them; but if we must have some one, I do not know
whether Mr. Twissel would not do quite as well, if he would come, and your
mother had no objection."

     "I am sure she would not.  Mr. Twissel was an old friend of my 
father's,
and, consequently, he would be no stranger at all to the family; besides, it
is daughter, and her friend, Martha, that I have invited upon this occasion;
have I done wrong?"

     "Not at all, it could not have happened better; I am sure they must be
very worthy people, and any one whom you please, or they know, that you feel
disposed to invite, do so, with the confidence that whatever pleases you on
the occasion, will please me."

     At that moment there was an alarming rapping at the door, which caused
them to pause a few moments; then they continued their conversation until 
the
servant announced to Miss Meredith, that Miss Twissel, her papa, and her
friend, Martha, were come.

 Next Time: A Pleasant Evening. -- The Bridesmaids.




                             CHAPTER CXXX. [sic]

                               [Chapter 140]

A PLEASANT EVENING. -- THE BRIDESMAIDS.


     "I know how that is," said Margaret, before she left the drawing-room;
"that was through my ma'.  I dare say she has invited them to take tea with
her to-night.  I should not at all wonder about that.  I have not seen them
for some time.  They keep a great deal at home, and visit but little.  They
are playful, homely girls, but good-hearted, and that is why I prefer them 
to
more fashionable friends, whose goodness of heart I cannot rely upon.  They
are insincere."

     "You are very right; but you will, I hope, let me see your friends, and
unless you have family matters to speak of, perhaps you will take tea up 
here
with me.  I shall be all alone if you do not; so, you see, I am speaking 
from
selfish motives; but do not think I shall be at all hurt if you do not see 
fit
to accept the invitation for them."

     "I will accept it for them cheerfully, and shall be much surprised if
they do not do so too," said Margaret, as she walked towards the door, and
then left the apartment, to proceed first to her own room, and there to
examine her present, before she sought the visitors to give them their
invitation.

     The parcel contained some handsome laces and other matters, beautiful 
and
expensive, such things as she could wear, and excite the envy of others; 
which
was, of all things, and usually is of women in general, the most enchanting
thing in all the world, and gives intense gratification.

     After admiring for a moment or two the beauties of the laces, she could
not help involuntarily exclaiming, --

     "This will be beautiful, so very becoming, and so much above anything
else that can be brought by my bridesmaids.  I shall be a queen amongst 
them;
indeed, they will but set me off to the utmost advantage.  I shall be the
glory of the occasion."

     Having secured her new acquisition from inquisitive eyes, by locking it
up in her drawers, she returned down stairs, and then entered the parlour,
where, truly enough, as she had imagined, there was Mr. Twissel, Miss 
Twissel,
and Miss Martha, all of whom were dressed out for the occasion.

     There was some truth in what Margaret had said to her mother, that the
two intended bridesmaids were not likely to induce any one to fall in love
with them.  They were oddities of the first water.  Miss Twissel had light
brown hair, bushy eyebrows, a straight masculine nose, a mouth that turned 
up
on one side, and one of her eyes had a gentle inclination to gaze at her 
nose,
while her complexion was increased by a vast quantity of sun freckles.

     Then, as for Miss Martha, she was another beauty of a similar class;
hooked nose, with one eye paying undue attention to the auricular organ, 
while
the other was somewhat injured by a blank appearance; her hair was red, and
she was pitted by the small-pox to a fearful extent.

     Such were the two friends whom Miss Meredith had chosen for 
bridesmaids,
with the laudable view of putting no temptation in the way of the colonel,
which Mrs. Meredith, her mother, most strenuously advised, as she had
experience of the men.

     "My dear Miss Twissel, and you, Martha!"

     "Ah! Margaret, God bless me, who could have imagined, above all things,
what I have come about.  What can you be thinking and doing? here you've no
friends to help you.  I see you have done it all yourself.  What can you 
think
of people? you have no mercy."

     "Aye," said Martha, "there's no doing anything while you are about.  No
one else has a chance, but you must tell us all about it."

     "Yes, yes, I will tell you all about it; and more than that, you shall
see the colonel if you please."

     "That is what we should like, above all things."

     "Oh! it is a colonel, then-- a rich Indian colonel.  Upon my word, you
will have to be presented at court next."

     "He! he! you are joking me now.  Well, never mind, I shall joke you 
some
of these days.  You may depend upon that; my turn will come next, and then I
won't forget you.  But seriously, there are more unlikely things may come to
pass than that."

     "Well, now; I dare say.  Who would have thought of that, now?  But then
you are so lucky, you see; only think what might have been the case if the
colonel had been a young man! why he might become as great a man as the
Marquis of Granby.  Why, you'd have been a marchioness then.  Well, bless my
heart, how things do come about!"

     "Well, you had better come up to the drawing-room," said Margaret, "and
see the colonel, who is waiting tea for us all.  Come, ma'."

     "Yes, my dear, I am ready.  Mr. Twissel, will you come?"

     "If you please," said Mr. Twissel, "if you please.  We shall now soon
have the pleasure of seeing an end to this affair; for, as it is to come 
off,
why, when it is over, it will be all the better.  Expectation is always a 
time
of uncertainty and anxiety-- at least, to most people."

     "So it is, Mr. Twissel, so it is; and I am not without my share of it;
for, in the first place, human life is short, and circumstances may alter
cases; so I am anxious to see it over, and offer no impediment in the way of
the completion of the marriage."

     "Certainly, you are quite right; having made up your mind to permit the
marriage to take place, why, the sooner the better."

     They were all now introduced to the colonel, who was very polite and
courtly, which in some degree embarassed the young ladies, who were 
compelled
to put on, as they expressed it, their best behaviour, and so did not become
quite so familiar.  However, that did not spoil the harmony of the meeting,
for the young ladies considered there was more respect paid to them, and the
less they were able to appreciate the politeness with which they were 
treated,
the more they believed themselves honoured.

     They were well enough pleased, and the conversation turned upon various
matters, while Mr. Twissel was uncommonly attentive to the colonel; indeed, 
he
watched him most narrowly, every turn and every expression, as if he were
resolved to ascertain, by constant surveillance, whether there was any
foundation for his half-inspired doubts respecting him; and also as to 
whether
it were possible that he could have had any hand in the disasters which he 
had
on two several occasions suffered.

     But yet he could see nothing -- nothing at all that gave him the
slightest pretext for persisting in his suspicion.  He appeared the same 
easy,
careless individual, who would not trouble himself to consider whether he 
was
watched or not, or whether his actions were the subject of other people's
thoughts, or whether they were unnoticed, it mattered nothing to him.

     "It is singular," he muttered to himself, "very singular, how it could
all happen by accident, and only at moments when I was watching him.  I 
can't
tell; and yet the occurrences were of that character, to another they would
seem wholly unconnected, and I am unable to connect them, save by fancy; but
he looks not a very old man, but rather like one who has the full use of his
faculties.  He is singularly pale, to be sure, and yet, at times, he does 
not
appear so old, nor does his arm and leg seem quite so bad at others; perhaps
it varies, according to circumstance, weather, the moon, or unforeseen
changes."

     He remained cogitating very quietly by himself; he was thoughtful, and
could by no means divest himself of th idea that there was something more 
than
common about the colonel.

     "He don't seem so blind with that eye as he might be," he muttered; 
"but
there is no use calculating about an Indian; they have got such luxurious
habits and fancies, that if he fancies one of his eyes is in any degree 
weak,
he will wear a shade for its preservation.  Well, he is entitled to do so, 
but
he ain't so old as they imagine.  And that will be no detriment to him or to
them; so much the better, unless they reckon upon the colonel's death, which
would hardly be an object to them, seeing that it could bring them no more;
indeed, it would diminish their income.  But he is a tall man now, and, if 
he
did not stoop so much, would yet be a fine man."

     These thoughts passed through his mind, time after time, during the 
whole
evening; while the colonel himself was at times conversing in the most 
refined
and courtly language, and doing much towards amusing them with anecdotes of
the places he had seen, and the battles he had fought.

     "You would be surprised," he said, "to hear that, in India, there are
places so cold that they more resemble the Polar regions than central Asia, 
of
which we only used to think of as being one of the hottest regions in the
world, filled with wild animals and numerous serpents."

     "Certainly, we hear more of that than anything else-- the yellow fever,
the cholera, and all these kinds of things, caused by exposure to the heat."

     "So they are; but it is only in the plains, and not on the high table
lands and mountains, where you gradually meet with more temperate climates,
many of which equal northern Europe for salubrity; and, further up, you come
to frozen regions."

     "Indeed! that is a phenomenon."

     "Oh, dear, no; the altitude of the plain, and the exposure, make the 
sole
difference.  I remember once, I was sent with some other regiments to 
chastise
some of the hill tribes."

     "Under whom was that?" inquired the attorney.

     "General Walker," returned the colonel; "he was a very able general, 
and
we performed some extraordinary marches under him, as well as some service."

     "Oh, indeed!" said the attorney; "what might have taken place?"

     "I will tell you an incident that did take place; and not relate more
scenes of carnage that we passed through in the execution of our duty than
shall be actually necessary.  We had, on one occasion, to storm a city; on
another, a fortified town; it was strong, and well protected by nature and
art.

     Well, we arrived there, and the gates were closed against us; guns were
brought to bear, and men appeared on the walls.  We expected, of course, a
sharp time of it, and being only the advance guard, we halted for the main
body to come up with us; and, after having summoned the garrison to 
surrender,
we put posts and watchers for the night, not expecting to do anything upon
that occasion; nor did we expect the main body up with us till the middle of
the next day, they having sent word on to me that they would not be up in
cosequence of some accident to some part of the train, which would have to 
be
repaired; but a portion of the troops would advance a stage nearer to me, in
case of an accident, upon which I could retire for support, or send to them 
to
come up as the exigencies of the moment should most require; but they did 
not
anticipate any  movement at all.  Nor did we; the fact was, we had made a
forced march of it; and had got over more ground than we had expected, and 
our
main body did not think we should have been so near the scene of action as 
we
were.

     However, a counsel of war was held amongst the officers; and it was
resolved that we should attempt nothing without the assistance of our
comrades, as the place was very strong, as I have before told you.

     Well, sir, half the night was over, and we lay fast asleep, having had 
a
hard-- very hard day's work of it, -- so hard that we could sleep sound on 
the
bare earth; we were all suddenly awakened by a loud explosion, which shook 
the
very earth under us; and, upon starting up, and rushing out of our tents, we
saw the earth and air illumined by the explosion of, as we afterwards 
learned,
and guessed at the moment, one of the enemy's powder magazines.

     In another minute we found there were plenty of falling missiles, with
the debris of the magazine, and the mangled corpses of the men who were near
it.

     There was an instant order to muster the men; everybody knew what was
meant.  They were all ready in a few moments-- indeed, we slept by our arms-
-
fully accoutred, so it did not take long to be ready for action.

     We were ordered to form in divisions and bodies, and as there was ample
breach made by the explosion there, I was ordered to mount the breach, and
enter the town for the purpose of assault.

     We did this.  We marched down upon the breach after some difficulties,
and were fairly in it; but had our commanding officer known any of the
difficulties; he would not have incurred the responsibility of ordering us 
to
advance, for the ruins we had to scramble over were dreadful, and, had there
been light, we could every one have been picked off by the enemy.

     Darkness was our friend, and we got into the town with a comparatively
trifling loss, and when our men got together they began to tell a tale, for
their volleys were well directed upon the enemy, who were drawn up in 
masses,
and whose fire directed ours.  We were not completely exposed to their fire,
for the same objects that exposed our men, as they were surmounted before
reaching the enemy, protected them from immense volleys of musketry.

     However, we carried the point, and at that moment another explosion 
took
place in some other part of the town, which illumined all around for a 
moment
or two, and then came masses of bricks, and stones, and timber, killing 
friend
and foe.  For a while we were staggered; we did not know what to think of 
this
affair.  We knew not whether we had an enemy to fight, or even where he was.
We were completely at a standstill.

     But this did not last long.  The defenders fled, and left us masters of
the field.  We remained under arms all that night, till daylight.

     Glad were we, indeed, when daylight came; we were fatigued, so much so
that our men could scarcely stand in the ranks.  Then parties were sent out 
to
look after the wounded, who had been left in all imaginable situations. It 
was
at such a moment that I was discovered; my leg was shattered by a musket
bullet."

     "And you lay bleeding all night?"

     "Yes.  Not exactly bleeding, for I had sense left me to bind a ligature
over the wound to stop the effusion of blood, which would have killed me in 
a
very short time.  However, there was no necessity to lose my leg, but it has
made me permanently lame."

     "I see you are so, sir," said Twissel; "but do you never feel it worse 
at
some times than at others?"

     "Yes, I do.  There are times when I do not know that I have received a
hurt at all; but sometimes I suffer a little, and am a little more lame in
consequence."

     "It was fortunate," said Twissel, "it was your leg, for it might have
been your head, you know, and that would have been a death-blow to your
fortune."

     "Yes," said the colonel, mildly; "I might have been killed, as you
observe; but at the same time I should have done my duty, which in these 
cases
is all we looked to.  I might have saved a better man, who had a wife and
family-- I had none."

     Conversation now ran on the forthcoming event, and Mr. Twissel was
invited by the colonel, and the whole party were well satisfied with each
other, and parted very good friends, with the promise of meeting again 
before
the propitious morning which was to unite the fates of Margaret Meredith and
Colonel Deverill.

 Next Time: A New Character. -- Miss Twissel's Visitor. -- The Invitations.




                            CHAPTER CXXXI. [sic]

                               [Chapter 141]

A NEW CHARACTER. -- MISS TWISSEL'S VISITOR. -- THE INVITATIONS.


     Nothing could exceed the smoothness and easiness of the course of 
things
in the wooing of Margaret Meredith; all things appeared so well ordered.
People were all of one mind; and it is needless to say that the young lady 
was
elated.  She was elated, and we might not be out of the way in saying she 
was
elated overmuch, and knew not how to keep the exhibition of her joy within
proper bounds; she could not help showing she was to be the lady of a 
colonel.

     Mrs. Meredith, too, was well pleased.  What could she do but feel proud
at the change that was about to take place?  She would go to watering places
in the summer, and remain in town during the winter; they would lead a very
fashionable life -- they would be of the elite, and all their acquaintances
they would be compelled to cut, or, at the most, only speak to them when 
they
were unseen by any others.

     It is astonishing how a change of circumstances produces a change in 
our
habits and feelings; how it happens that those who were considered 
respectable
acquaintances suddenly become the objects of our aversion, and we begin to
devise all sorts of methods for evading recognition, or of speaking to them
when we can avoid it.

     This arises merely from the change in one's circumstances, which causes
us to look for something much beyond what we have been used to; but,
unfortunately, it brings ingratitude often in the train of its consequents.

     "My dear," said Mrs. Meredith to her daughter Margaret, "we really 
cannot
know the people at the corner house over the way, who invited us to their
parties."

     "Oh, dear, no, we cannot think of it; but we must get rid of them the
best way we can.  You see they will not be quite the thing for us when we 
come
to have our change of circumstances, you may depend upon it; it will become
necessary to weed one's acquaintance."

     "Yes, that must be done." said Mrs. Meredith.

     "And the sooner we set about it the better; for the more intimate we
continue now, the more trouble will there be of getting rid of them
afterwards."

     "Certainly; we need not accept of their invitation for to-night."

     "Oh, dear, no; I have dismissed the whole affair from my mind, and 
there
is no need even of thinking of it any more.  I shall not even think of 
sending
them an answer; the consequence will be, they will be angry, and expect we
shall go and apologise, and when they find we don't, but that we try to get
rid of them, they will be baffled, and the whole affair is settled."

     "That is a very good plan, my dear.  Then, you know, there are the
Morgans; we must positively get rid of them.  It will never do to have those
young men hanging about; the colonel would do something dreadful, to say the
least of it.  Why, he would shoot them, and perhaps have a separation, who
knows?"

     "But then I should be entitled to a maintenance."

     "You would, my dear; but unfortunately you well know you have no
property, an that, added to an early separation, would put it in his power 
to
offer you and compel your acceptance of a very small sum, which he may pay 
as
he pleases-- weekly, monthly, or quarterly."

     "I see, ma; but we will run no risk of that kind of thing.  Moreover,
there would be those girls, they would be a nuisance hanging about the
colonel."

     "No doubt, and the cause of unhappiness in the extreme.  Better to 
leave
all such people; you are a great deal better without them.  Why, I tell you
what, you will be at no loss of company or acquaintances, you will find they
will be sure to spring up; property is sure to enable you to choose those 
whom
you will have, and whom you will not-- the reason is obvious enough.
Moreover, like loves like, you know, and people with means soon find out
people who have none."

     "Yes, ma, and those who have plenty; besides, a colonel, and a man of
rank and standing-- and everybody knows that a colonel in the India service 
is
a rich man-- and that would bring us all into the best of society.  Only 
think
of my going to Bath, Bristol, and Brighton, in their seasons.  Of course we
couldn't keep company with people who can't afford to go to some fashionable
place at least once in a year."

     "Oh, dear, no; certainly not, my dear; but there is no need of our
troubling ourselves about that matter; we shall only go when the colonel 
goes,
and we shan't be seen without him, and he'll be a constraint upon them; and,
therefore, where they find themselves uncomfortable, they will not come
again."

     "That will be a very good plan, for it will appear as their own faults;
but, at the same time, I do not trust to that upon all occasions; it might
fail, and then we should have to take some unpleasant steps to get rid of
them, which is certainly easily done, but unpleasant."

     Yes, yes, certainly," replied the mother; and then suddenly, as a knock
and ring came upon the door, Margaret said, "Dear me, who is that? -- I hope
none of these people whom I have been speaking about-- it will be a dreadful
nuisance to all; especially when I am to be married in three days more."

     "You needn't be seen, Margaret; I'll see them."

     "Do, ma; and I'll go up stairs.  But let's hear who it is first, who
comes today."

     At that moment she heard the door open, and her own name pronounced, 
and
at once knew the speaker, and she said to her mother, --

     "Oh, ma, 'tis Miss Twissel, my bridesmaid; what an infliction! but, 
then,
I must see her.  She has come, I suppose, to consult me about some new gown,
or the way in which she and her friend will have their hair done up on the
occasion-- nothing more important, I dare say."

     "Very well, my dear; they had better come in-- send them in pray," she
added to the servant.  "Oh, Miss Twissel, how glad we are to see you."

     "Now, really," said Miss Twissel; "how kind you are, for I am sure you
speak the truth.  Oh, Margaret, don't you feel all of a flutter?"

     "I don't, indeed; I am very comfortable.  I hope you are all quite 
well--
don't put yourself out of the way on this occasion; you need not, I assure
you."

     "Oh, I have got my pa to give us new gowns, and some lace; but I did 
not
mean to tell you that-- I and Martha had agreed that that should be a secret
between us; that we should not say anything about it to any one; but 
surprise
you on your wedding morning."

     "Ah, you have been at a great deal of trouble and expense about this
affair, I am sure.  You really must not think I wish you to do all this; I
really don't know how to scold you enough, for I shall be dressed very 
plainly
indeed."

     "Oh, but then you are the bride-- we ain't, you know, and that makes 
the
difference; besides which, we have a visitor come up to London to see us."

     "Indeed! some young gentleman, I suppose, whose heart you want to run
away with, and so have another wedding, and upon your own account this time;
and, perhaps, you are helping Miss Martha to a husband.  What is he-- a
physician or a divine?"

     "Neither-- but, I will tell you, he is only an old man."

     "An old man!  What a sweetheart you have chosen, to be sure! but, I 
dare
say you have your reason as well as other people.  But have you know him
long?"

     "No, we haven't done so; but, the fact is, pa' and he have had some
business together, and they are very much in each others company.  He's a 
man,
however, of great rank, though a very odd man to talk to, I assure you, but 
a
man of rank and property."

     "Indeed!  Oh, tell me what he is-- a lord?"

     "Well, he is not much short of it; and he is higher than a great many
lords, I assure you.  Why, he's no less than an admiral-- only, I wasn't to
say anything about it."

     "Oh, will he be with you when my marriage takes place?"

     "Yes, he will; and I wanted to know, as he will be much with my father,
and as a visitor, shall we be intruding to bring him here to grace your
wedding?"

     "Oh, yes; by all means," said Margaret, who thought he presence of an 
old
man could in no way interfere with any of her schemes; besides, a man of 
rank,
such as an admiral, would greatly increase the noise of her marriage.  
Indeed,
here was probably a new acquaintance with whom she could be intimate; 
besides,
it was some one of consequence on her side that the great man was to come, 
and
would, she thought, add some lustre to herself.

     "Well, then, I would not ask him until I had seen you, because it might
turn out you would be displeased; and, as I have not done so, I cannot tell
you whether he will come or not.  He's a strange man, and I won't ask him
until the night before."

     "Very well; we shall be quite happy to see him.  I dare say he'll come,
if you tell him who's going to be married.  Indeed, if he's likely to come,
I'll invite a few friends to meet him; but I won't say anything to anybody
about it."

     "No; let it be a surprise to them all; and let nobody know whom they 
are
going to meet."

     "That will be delightful, certainly-- very delightful.  What a surprise
it will be to them to be introduced to colonel this and admrial that.  I
declare I long for the day on account of the confusion that some persons 
will
be in."

     "I must now bid your good bye; for I've got to call upon my dressmaker,
to give her some orders."

     "You will stop and take tea with us?  Surely you won't run away."

     "Oh, but I must," said Miss Twissel, and so said Miss Martha, and after
much pressing and refusing, they parted, and left Margaret filled by other
thoughts than those she had so recently held.

     "Ma',["] said she, after a long pause, "do you know what I have been
thinking of?"

     "No, my dear, I do not."

     "Well, then, it is this, that after all, we may as well make a bit of a
figure for the last time.  That we will have some friends who will figure 
upon
that occasion and no other."

     "What makes you think so, my dear Margaret?"

     "Why, you see, ma', we are likely to have a distinguished visitor, and 
we
may as well have as many as we can; their number and dresses will look well,
and as we shall leave town immediately, I don't see that we shall be at any
future time annoyed by their visits.  Indeed, it will be retiring from their
society after giving them a feast."

     "Well, to be sure, I never thought of that," said her mother -- "I 
never
thought of it.  What shall we do now-- how can we provide for so many?"

     "Send an order to a pastry cook to provide breakfast for so many, 
whether
they come or not, and then we need trouble ourselves very little about 
giving
them time.  If we tell them about the day before, they will have all in
readiness for us."

     "Well, well-- and as for the expense, it will be of no consequence."

     "None," said Margaret.  "I shall be able to pay that and others, if we
owe any.  But now comes the job of inviting visitors, and we must only 
invite
those who will make up a show, dress well, and pass off on the occasion for
fashionable people."

     "Oh, as for that, there are many people who never had a penny in their
lives to call their own, may be very fashionable-looking people, and pass 
for
men of a thousand a year, to say nothing of a lord looking like a workman, 
and
the like, which is common enough."

     "Then we'll settle it at that point, ma', and you had better 
superintend
the invitations and the other affair-- the breakfast, I mean."

     "Very well, my dear; you know that I have no objection.  I have seen 
such
occasions before, and I well know what they ought to be; therefore you may
safely rely upon my judgment in such an affair as that at least.["]

     "And about the selection of friends-- visitors, I mean."

     "That you may also leave to me," said Mrs. Meredith; "and, depend upon
it, I will not invite one party whom we shall have cause to say we are sorry
they came; though, you know, every allowance would be made for them by the
colonel or admiral, if he come.  By the way, I would not tell the colonel a
word about it, for sometimes the land service hates the sea service, and the
latter often laugh at the former; so it will be safest to say nothing."

     "No, ma, I won't-- I didn't intend to do so."

     Thus both mother and daughter had suddenly changed their views of what
was to take place on the day of the intended marriage.  They were now 
resolved
they would have as many of their old friends as they could get together upon
the occasion, to cause the affair to go off with all the eclat that it was
possible; it would be the last ball of the season -- that is, it would be 
the
last she ever intended to give them, and that would be the last occasion 
upon
which they would meet.

     Her respect for Miss Twissel was augmented by the knowledge that she 
had
an admiral for a friend or a visitor, it didn't matter which.  Who could 
tell
what might happen?  Mightn't Miss Twissel marry an admiral, as ugly as she
was, as well as she should a colonel? but there were many reasons why she
should.  She, too, might have had some means of entangling his heart; 
perhaps,
after all, she only came there with him for the purpose of showing him off.

     "At all events," said Margaret, to herself; "at all events, he is one
that we can keep on terms with; and it will look well to be acquainted with
some person of rank.  I am, at all events, well pleased it has happened as 
it
has."

    Mrs. Meredith, on the other hand, appeared to think her daughter's
marriage with a colonel, ought to be celebrated by no common rejoicings; 
that,
indeed, the marriage ought to go off with as much disturbance to the whole
neighbourhood, as it was possible to make.

     This could not bet better effected than in the manner we have referred
to; namely, inviting a number of persons to come and be present at the
ceremony, and to take a late breakfast, and to wish the bride joy, to see 
her
depart, and then to lose sight of her, as she hoped, for ever.

     This purpose Mrs. Meredith ably carried out, and she succeeded in
inviting about two or three-and-twenty persons together; and any person who
had a carriage and would come in it, was sure of an invitation -- that was a
passport to the marriage feast.

     "Well," she muttered to herself, as she reckoned up the number of 
persons
whom she expected to be present upon the occasion -- "well, I don't think I
have omitted any one who ought to be present, nor have I invited any one who
ought not to be here.  I shall have a busy day of it-- very busy day; but 
the
result is everything; so long as the marriage takes place, and we are really
married to an East Indian colonel, why we shall do, there can be no doubt of
it."

     This was a consolatory reflection.  There was but little else, indeed,
that could be done-- little, indeed.  The cook had the orders for the
entertainment the next day; they had but little to do in the household with
that; indeed, they had extra hands, lest there should be any need of them, 
as
she would not have anything go wrong upon such an occasion, for worlds.

     But there was one thing that gave her some satisfaction, and that was,
Mr. Twissel had not been to them lately to give any doubtful counsels; ever
since she had announced her intention of permitting the marriage to take
place, he had not been to express any doubts about the matter; but had been 
a
mere spectator, doing all that was necessary.  He had forgotten all 
objection,
and never made one.  He was perfectly quiescent; but would now and then look
very hard at the colonel, but that was all; he never discovered anything, 
and
all was smooth and pleasant.

 Next Time: The Wedding Morning. -- Disruption of Harmony, and the New
 Acquaintance. -- The Conclusion.




                            CHAPTER CXXXII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 142]

THE WEDDING MORNING. -- DISRUPTION OF HARMONY, AND THE NEW ACQUAINTANCE. --
THE CONCLUSION.


     Accident, strange to say, had taken our old acquaintance, Admiral Bell,
to the house of a lawyer, there to transact some business, as well as to 
lodge
at his house.  The fact was, the old admiral hearing that a brother officer
was in trouble -- one who had shared with him the dangers of the sea and the
fight -- he came to town to see, himself, what could be done; and finding 
the
affair beyond his comprehension, or, at least beyond his power of personal
interference; that, in fact, it required the aid of a third party, and that
third person must, of necessity, be a lawyer, he determined to employ the 
man
who happened to be conversant with the circumstances of the case, and this 
was
no other than Mrs. Meredith's friend, Twissel.

     However, the admiral's good will towards the race who follow the law, 
not
being so great as his philanthropy, he determined to watch every stage of 
the
proceedings, and to permit nothing to be done without his knowledge, and to
see that nothing was neglected.

     Hearing from Mr. Twissel the affair that was to take place, a sudden
crotchet entered his head, that he should like to be present at the 
ceremony,
and he broached it to Mr. Twissel, who turned to his daughter to ascertain 
if
it were at all possible.

     That young lady was desirous of shining among her acquaintances, as one
who could introduce an admiral, and who did not like the idea of Margaret
Meredith being so find a lady as she now attempted to make herself appear;
indeed, she would have been willing to have assisted in raising her some
species of mortification; she felt more than true pleasure in the disaster
that would be the cause of such feelings.  There was a very general dislke 
to
Miss Margaret Meredith, and the truth was, she was much more than usually
arrogant and proud, and took all imaginable methods of vexing and mortifying
those around her.

     But there is little to be said about that; the consent was brought back
to the attorney, who felt somewhat elated at it, and communicated it to the
admiral, with some remarks upon the kindness and condescension of the 
persons
who had done him so much honour.

     This, however, only had the effect of drawing from the admiral, the 
word,
swab, and then he became silent and did not appear to be at all taken aback 
by
the knowledge that an East India colonel was the bridegroom on the occasion,
and one of very large property and singular behaviour.

     The evening before the marriage was a busy one.  The young ladies had 
to
arrange and to re-arrange all their finery; and the bride herself had the 
task
of seeing how she became her bridal dress, to do an infinity of other little
matters, and to contemplate the change that was about to take place in so
short a period.  A few hours more, and she would become a wife.

     The colonel, himself, did not in the least fall off in his ardour; he 
was
particularly anxious it should, on no account, be delayed after the day 
fixed.
A later day he appeared to have the utmost objection to; indeed, he declared
he would do anything if it came but a day or two earlier.

     However, this was considered impossible, and the young lady was 
permitted
to have her way, though it was expressly stipulated that it should not be an
hour after the appointed time, for he declared himself dying with impatience
to call her his own.

     "Now, ma," said Margaret, as she sat talking to her mother the night
before; "now, ma, I hope you will not give any of these people countenance
when I am gone, and throw off their acquaintance; you will be firm on this
point for my sake."

     "I will, my dear," said Mrs. Meredith, "I will."

     "Then, when I come back, I shall know more of the colonel's mind about
where we shall live, and how we shall live.  He must let me have something
handsome; I have no doubt but what he will; he does not appear to be a
close-handed man, quite the reverse; and, all things considered, we shall be
able to make a very agreeable living out of it."

     "Why, yes, my dear, I cannot doubt it; he is, no doubt, a man of 
property
and can well afford us enough, and some sum as pin-money; indeed, he is too
liberal now to be otherwise by and bye; perhaps he will keep on this house,
and pay for proper domestics, and keep a carriage.  What a change it will be
for us all, and how the neighbourhood will stare!"

     "Yes, ma, they will; but suppose we were to reside out of town, we 
should
have our carriage driving into town, as a matter of course, and now and then
sleep in town when we made up a party, or went to the theatre."

     "Yes, my dear.  What time shall you see the colonel in the morning?"

     "Not before I am ready to go."

     "To church?  Well, but you will have some breakfast with him?"

     "No, he will be in his own room, I dare say, till late; he will scarce
present himself before the time has come to start; you know his habits, he
does not get up very early, and I do not expect to see much alteration.  At
eleven o'clock we are to be at church.  We breakfast at nine, you know, so 
we
shall have time."

     "Oh, he is sure to be down to breakfast, ther can be no doubt about 
that;
indeed, he must be called for the purpose; of course, there must be some
deviation form a regular rule upon extraordinary occasions like the 
present."

     "Well, well, there may be; but have you given all the invitations you
intended to give? -- and have you got any answers to them so as to ensure
their attendance?"

     "Oh, yes, that is all safe and fixed; we shall have a good many here by
half-past eight in the morning, at the latest; but you must contrive to let 
me
have money very soon, or to send me some up, as I am getting very short, for 
I
have laid out a great deal of money lately, and much more than I could, 
under
other circumstances, spare or afford."

     "Of course, ma, you will not lose anything by this; I shall take care 
of
you; not a penny that you have laid out but what shall be repaid, and with a
handsome return; but do not think about this, it grows late and I must to
sleep."

     "Do, my dear, and I'll wake you in time in the morning."

              *           *           *           *           *

     The morning came, and some of them were about early.  Mrs. Meredith was
up, and so was Margaret.  She could not lie so late as usual.  She had done
much, and yet she had so much to do still.  It was really astonishing to see
what there was to do -- no one would have believed it, and even Margaret
became surprised.

     The morning was now fairly come; the servants were about in the house,
and the neighbours were up and about; she could hear her mother chiding and
scolding; she could hear the sound of her voice, and she began to believe
there was now no time to lose.

     The hour of nine was now gone.  The knocker and the guests had been 
heard
for the last half hour at the door, and she could hear the voices of the
guests below, some of whom spoke audibly enough; then they soon after
descended to th breakfastroom, which, by the way, was the drawingroom, as
there was not enough room below.

     The colonel, at the same moment, entered the room, and a vast number of
congratulations were given and received, form side to side, with the utmost
urbanity and good will.  The colonel, for the first time, had thrown on one
side the green shade which he usually wore, but he looked remarkably pale,
though he had still the looks of a hearty and healthy man.

     The paleness, which seemed to be constitutional, was very 
extraordinary;
but that was explained by the colonel saying, that he had been so ever since
he had the yellow fever, which had had that effect upon his complexion.

     There was much rejoicing at the occurrences that were now in progress;
everybody praised the viands; everything was of the best and first-rate
quality, and there were many attendants, which made it so much the better 
and
the more comfortable, as everybody had an abundance of everything.

     Mrs. Meredith now shone in the greatest triumph; there was none so 
great
and grand.  She patronized everybody, and appeared remarkably condescending,
considering she was the mother of a daughter who was about to marry a 
retired
East India service colonel.  There were few who did not understand fully the
nature of the condescension of the lady herself; besides, she was the
presiding goddess of the feast.

     Among those who had been invited was the Miss Smith and Mr. Smith.  
This
was the young lady who had been so terrifed at the attack that had been made
upon her the first night that Colonel Deverill lodged there, and on that 
night
he was so terribly vexed and disturbed.

     Mrs. Meredith had invited them, because they were people of means, and
Miss Smith could not now do any mischief, because the colonel was pledged to
Margaret too far to retract; and as there were several young females, why, 
the
more the better, because it would divert his attention.

     Miss Smith, however, came out of curiosity, and because it was a 
wedding
party, which is the delight and admiration of all young females, and Miss
Smith was no exception.  Mr. Smith was civil and polite, and hid his 
internal
dislke to the colonel, which he felt and could not account for it; neither 
did
his daughter -- she had a great aversion to him, but at the same time
suppressed it.

     The colonel was courtly and complimentary, and made civil speeches to
such as spoke to him; indeed, he never for a moment lost his self-
possession;
he stood in a less stooping posture than usual, and he was considered a 
tall,
handsome man -- a fine man.

     "Mr. Twissel," said the colonel, "I am happy to see you-- especially
gratified to see you-- you will be witness of my happiness to-day-- you will
mark my progress in this affair, and learn what lesson it may teach.  That 
is
the way we should pass through life, Mr. Twissel, is it not?  Gain knowledge
by experience, and become, in old age, a wise man."

     "Why, yes; oh, yes," said Twissel, who felt there was something in the
remark that touched him to the quick, and he winced under the smart; but he
thought it might have been accidentally given, and the colonel was quite
ignorant of his disasters; and yet it was a very home thrust, without any
previous introduction to it, that made it all the more uncomfortable, and he
merely replied, --

     "I am happy to see you, Colonel Deverill, and to see you so happy, and
the young lady, who, I am sure, deserves to be happy; in fact, I think you
both deserve happiness; I am sure, I wish you every imaginable joy, and it
gives me great pleasure in seeing it."

     "I am sure you do, sir; but you do not seem to eat and enjoy yourself."

     "I am so occupied in witnessing the felicity of others, that I had
forgotten it; moreover, I expect a friend to be present who happens to be
late; he is quite a stranger to all present, and therefore I wished to
countenance him as much as I could on that account."

     "Then I will not press you now; perhaps you'll do me the favour of
introducing your friend to me when he comes, yourself, and I shall be most
happy to receive him."

     "Thank you, colonel, you do me much honour; I will accept of your great
kindness, and do myself the pleasure of presenting him to you, and to Miss
Meredith, whom I hope to see soon changed in name."

     "I hope the time will now be very short.  What hour is it?"

     "Half-past nine," said the attorney, consulting his watch.

     "At eleven we must be at the church.  Well, if we leave at half-past 
ten,
then we shall be there in ample time; I would it were over and that we were 
on
our journey."

     "Ah! you are impatient, colonel," said Margaret, as she came up to him.

     "My dear angel!" replied Deverill, bowing, "how could I be otherwise 
when
you are the object of my affections?  It is not impatience to leave this 
good
company-- quite the reverse.  But it is because the change of scene,
travelling, and change of air will do you much good, and is, I can see, 
quite
necessary for you."

     "I think it will do me no harm," said Margaret; "but here comes ma, who
really looks tired."

     "Well, my dear, I am a little fatigued, but you know I shall have ample
time to recover myself.  I shall have nothing to disturb my repose."

     "Indeed, Mrs. Meredith!" said the colonel; "I am sure we must alter 
that;
we must find some other kind of employment for you, and not suffer you to
remain hidden at home.  You have catered so well for us this morning, that I
am sure you are a most valuable acquisition to a household; with such a
superintendence as yours, we should have everything in the utmost plenty, 
and
at the proper moment."

     "Ah, colonel! you are flattering-- you are."

     "We shall soon show that we are not flattering, I hope," said the
colonel.  "My dear madam, you are the life and soul of the whole company.
What should we have done without you?  I hope all our friends here are happy
and comfortable.  I do not know them well enough to pay them all that
attention and respect they deserve."

     "Exactly, colonel; they all know that well enough, and are fully alive 
to
the honour you do them in being present in the midst of them."

     "Who is that young lady who was looking here just now?" inquired the
colonel.

     "Who? the young lady with the elderly gentleman by her side?"

     "Yes; I should like to be introduced to her," said the colonel.

     "Oh! certainly," said Mrs. Meredith, vexed in her own heart that she 
had
invited her and her father, now, for she had no wish that any one present
should be future acquaintances; but there was no help for it; she must
introduce them, and accordingly she went up, with the best grace she could 
put
on, to them both, to request they would be introduced to the colonel, who
desired the honour of their acquaintance.

     There was no hesitation, of course, and they at once advance to meet 
him,
and were introduced to the colonel as Miss and Mr. Smith.

     "I am most happy to see you, sir," said the colonel; "and the young 
lady
here is your daughter, I can see, by the family likeness she bears to you."

     Miss Smith, however, could not repress a convulsive shudder as she 
looked
upon the colonel.  It might have been his complexion, or it might have been
that his features brought some terrible recollections to her mind; but she
could not, for a moment or so, speak.

     "The young lady is ill!" said the colonel, who noticed the emotion.

     "What is the matter, Clara, my dear?" said Mr. Smith; "what's the
matter-- you are ill?"

     "No, no," said Miss Smith; "it was a-- a-- sudden-- sudden dizziness 
that
came across me.  I dare say I shall be better by and bye.  I am sorry it
should have come upon me now."

     "Ah! my dear young lady," said Colonel Deverill, drawing himself up to
his full height, and looking gravely, but speaking with the utmost courtesy,
"you have nothing to regret respecting the occasion; the illness itself is a
matter of regret to us all, I am sure; however, let us hope it will be but
temporary, and that you will be able to wish me joy, and my beautiful 
bride."

     "You see, Colonel Deverill, ever since the night she was disturbed by 
the
strange attack of what she believes to have been a vampyre, or something 
that
had the form of a man, and a taste for blood, she has been affected thus."

     "Dear me!" said the colonel; "what a shocking thing-- a very shocking
affair!  I think perhaps, the young lady is subject to illness," and he
touched his forehead, as much as to intimate an insinuation that the young
lady might be somewhat affected in her intellects.

     "No, sir; quite the reverse," said her father.  "I myself saw a tall,
gaunt figure gliding away, which felled me in an instant, and I lay half a
minute stunned."

     "God bless me!" said the colonel; "this affair is quite romantic!  If a
German writer had such material by him, what would he not make of it?"

     There had been a loud knocking at the door, and some one announced; but
nobody took any notice of it.  Colonel Deverill did not hear it, but stood
talking to Mr. Smith; while Admiral Bell was introduced by Mr. Twissel, who
led him towards the group, explaining what had happened.

     "By G-d!" said the admiral; "d'ye see how they are crowding about the
poor girl?  Why, they'd extinguish a fire-- if there was one!  Why don't you
give young woman air?  If you don't stand on one side, I'll put a whole
broadside into you, as I would into a Frenchman!"

     This singular address produced an immediate sensation, and many moved
away.

     "Colonel Deverill," said Mr. Twissel, "allow me to introduce my friend
Admiral Bell to you.  Admiral Bell, this is Colonel Deverill.  -- Eh? -- oh!
-- eh?"

     These latter exclamations were uttered in consequence of the extreme
surprise depicted on the countenances of both parties.  Admiral Bell's
surprise was nothing out of the way; but that of Colonel Deverill was a 
matter
of consternation to many of them.  He stepped back a pace or two, and then 
his
lips parted, as though he would speak, but he could not; he panted -- his 
eye
glared, and his nostrils dilated.

     "Shatter my mainmast-- upset the cabouse-- turn my state-cabin into a
cockpit, and the quarter-deck to a gambling-booth to the whole ship's
company!"

     "What's all this about?" exclaimed Mrs. Meredith.

     "Oh, that odious man! -- who is he? -- what is---"

     "Why, ma'am, I'm old Admiral Bell; very well known for having beaten 
the
French, and the terror of all vampyres.  Why, look at the swab-- but you 
ain't
going to get off this time!"

     "What is the matter, dear colonel?" said Margaret.  "You are ill--
speak-- what is the matter?"

     "Ah!" said the admiral; "let him speak, and he'll tell you he's no
colonel, and his name ain't Deverill, or, if it be, it ain't his only name; 
he
is Varney the vampyre!"

     "A vampyre!" said Miss Smith, starting up with a shriek; "a vampyre!
Good heavens!  I was not mistaken, then; that must be the man!" and she sank
back in her father's arms.

     "What! has he been at any of his tricks again!" exclaimed the admiral,
and he made a stride towards him; but Varney -- for it was he -- avoided him
by stepping aside, and placing some other person between himself and the
admiral, and then he said, --

     "What this madman will say you will not listen to-- you----."

     "Madman! well, I'm hanged; call me man!" said the admiral.  "I wish I 
had
my sword by my side, and I would teach you how a madman can fight; but you 
are
not going; I have something to say to you first.  If he's going to marry 
that
young lady, all I can say is, she will be food for him-- she'll never live
till to-morrow; her blood will made [sic] his pale face ruddy!"

     Varney stood no longer; but seeing many around him who appeared to have
an inclination to stop his passage, he suddenly made to the door, which he
secured for a moment on the outside, and then in another he was clear of the
house.

     This was no sooner done, than all present, who were staring at each 
other
in mute amazment, and unable to account for what had happened, looked at the
new comer, the admiral, who immediately began to relate enough of Varney 
that
made it apparent to all present that he was not what he represented himself 
to
be.

     Amid the commiserations of their friends, and their jeers, Mrs. 
Meredith
sold all her furniture, and, with her daughter, retired to some little 
place,
where they opened a small shop, to eke out a living by such means.  They 
were
unable even to pay many debts they had contracted on account of this 
marriage,
and they were, moreover, ashamed to be seen by their former acquaintance.

                           CHAPTER CXXXIII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 143]

A SCENE IN WINCHESTER CATHEDRAL. -- THE CATHEDRAL ROBBERS. -- A STORM. -- 
THE
VAULTS BENEATH THE AISLE. -- THE FLIGHT OF THE ROBBERS, AND THE  
RESUSCITATED
CORPSE.


     The sun had long deserted the horizon, and the good city of Winchester
had been buried in darkness many hours; while the moon, though high in her
course, was obscured by the hazy clouds that drifted from the south-west.  
The
gusty winds whistled round the walls of the cathedral church, producing an
unpleasant sensation, with a forboding of a coming storm.

     The inhabitants of the quiet, orderly town, were steeped in repose, and 
a
stranger who might by chance have wandered at such an untoward hour abroad,
would not have found one single ray from any window; save, perhaps, at one 
or
two hotels, which merely keep open till the London mail passed through, lest
any passengers should make their stay at Winchester.

     Save at these places, all were reposing peaceably in their beds; and 
the
tower of the cathedral frowned majestically upon the tombstones below, and
upon the surrounding buildings, which appeared to peep upon the limits of 
the
grave-yard; while the fir trees that were yet standing bent beneath the 
blast,
as it swept across the low walls, by which the cathedral on one side is
bounded.

     But the solitary churchyard was not without its occupants, living or
dead; for its sanctity is invaded by the presence of three men, who emerge
from the narrow streets and courts situated between it and the cross, and 
then
crossing beneath the shade of some object, they stood beneath the low wall
which surrounded the churchyard.

     They paused for several moments, and gazed around them in every
direction, and up at the houses that were nearest to them; but there was no
sign of light or anything stirring in any of the houses adjacent.

     "I think all is right to-night," said one of the men to his companions.

     "Ay, right enough; there will be nobody near us to-night."

     "No," replied a third; "and if the signs of the weather are good for
anything, why, we shall have a rough night; and though that is unpleasant, 
yet
it makes interruptions less likely, and success more certain."

     "You are right, Josh; we shall have a good job this time."

     "There, then, that will do until we are safe; it's no use talking here;
if the old watchman comes round, we may have to book it, and then we may not
have a chance."

     "Ha, ha, ha! as for the old watchman, he is not the fool you take him 
to
be, if you imagine him at all likely to disturb himself on such a night as
this; he'll sleep in his box till he wakes and finds it is fine."

     "Well, be that as it may, " said the other, impatiently, "it is all 
right
now."

     "Yes, all right."

     "Then just help me over, and I'll get down on the other side, while one
of you can get up on the wall and hand the tools down to me."

     "Can't you throw them over?"

     "I could, but it is not worth while to make any noise, even though we
felt sure that it will not be heard.  There have been most strange things 
done
in our time, you know, and there is no telling what may happen."

     "Ah, the dead may come to life, Josh."

     "So they might; and a pig might fly, but, as they say, it is a very
unlikely bird."

     "Well, then, up with you."

     As he spoke, one of the men gave one of his companions a lift up, and
with this aid he got on the wall, and then quietly slipping down into the
burial-ground, he awaited his companions, one of whom immediately mounted 
the
wall in the same manner, and who received a bag, which he handed down to his
comrade, who was in the graveyard belonging to the cathedral.

     "Well, is all right?" he said.

     "Yes, all right; don't stay up there like a cat on a wall; come down, 
or
you may by chance be seen."

     The other two men immediately came over the wall, and they all three
collected round a monument that stood up, and here a short consultation took
place.

     "Now, how shall we proceed?"

     "We must get into the vaults somehow or other, if we dig our way in,
which I think is much the most easily done."

     "What! undermine the building?"

     "Scarcely so much as that."

     "Well, but we can get into the body of the cathedral, and then into the
vaults that way.  There is a door."

     "Yes, there is a door, but it is so close to the verger's door, that 
you
are sure to awake him."

     "I have opened more than one door in my time, and yet I never awoke
anybody in doing so; he must sleep wonderfully light."

     "Ay, so he may; but in this case the door is so strong that there is no
chance of breaking it open, without great inconvenience and noise; there is 
no
room to work in, and, moreover, the verger keeps a little cur always 
sleeping
on the mat close to his door, so that no one can approach without his giving
alarm."

     "What a brute!"

     "Yes; but there is a means of entering besides that."

     "Where-- and how?"

     "In the back of the cathedral there is a large marble slab, on which is
carved some letters, that I never could make out; but I'm told it says that
somebody lies buried underneath that stone, but I know immediately below are
the vaults."

     "Well, but the marble you speak of would weigh fourteen or fifteen
hundred weight, which would be no joke."

     "No, by Jove," said his companion; "we had better by far dig our way 
in,
since we shall have so much difficulty in getting in; we can soon dig out 
soil
enought to let us get down into the vaults."

     "Well, we had better set to work at once, lest we lose all chance.  If 
we
have a long job, we had better set to work early, as well as stop here, for 
if
we are surprised we shall have to run."

     "And the yard will be watched ever afterwards, as sure as we shall have 
a
storm presently."

     "So we shall.  Work away, Josh; where are the tools?"

     "Here they are," said the man, throwing the bag down and opening it; 
and
then he pulled out some tools, consisting of pickaxe and shovels, and a
crowbar or two, and several other little materials, which were useful upon
such occasions.

     "Well, now, where shall we commence?"

     "Just at the side here; we are safe to get in somewhere where the wall 
is
weakest, for I believe the vaults are all walled in."

     "They must be, to have a secure foundation for such a weight as there
must be about it; and, to my mind, we have got a decent job.  It's very much
like a fortress, and if it was easy to get in this way, we should hear of 
such
things being done much oftener than they are, that is my opinion."

     "And a very good opinion it is, too, until another is heard; but it is 
no
use being faint-hearted; the harder the job, the harder we ought to set at 
it,
that's all; but there are some few things not thought of by others, you 
know,
and it is sometimes the hardest thing in the world to think of the most
simple."

     "There's some truth in that."

     The men having found the spot they most desired, they set about digging
and picking it up in good earnest; but it was difficult work, and the soil
about the cathedral was very hard, owing to the quantity of rubbish that had
been driven or trodden into the earth for centuries, either through accident
or design, to harden and secure the permanency of the work around.  There 
were
many heavy and large stones, as well as small broken stones; also, flint in 
no
samll quantity, that every now and then resisted the blows of the pick.

     "Well, I'm thinking we have all three worked half an hour, and have not
got a foot deep yet."

     "We have not got much deeper, certainly."

     "Do you think we shall get in to-night?"

     "To-night or never," said the third man.

     "You are right, comrade; shoulder your picks and then we shall see what
way we can make in another half hour.  Who can tell? we may come to a softer
soil below; this is only the filling up."

     The men again set to work heartily, but they seemed to have no success 
--
they could not make anything of it; it appeared to resist all their efforts;
and the sparks often flew from the blows they made with their tools.

     The perspiration ran down their faces, and as they paused to wipe their
foreheads, they gazed upwards at the clouds.  It was heavy, and the wind was
blowing fresh, and now and then a heavy spot of rain.

     "By St. Peter," said one of them, "I expect we shall have a storm
presently.  I already feel the heavy drops that fall occasionally; and if 
one
may judge by them of what we may expect, we shall have it heavily."

     "So much the better; we shall have less interruption."

     "Well, I don't know what you call interruption, but this is a complete
stopper;  I can't make any impression with the pick, it is as hard as rock;
and then comes some of those old walls that are rather harder than granite--
you may as well pick at a cart-load of pig iron."

     As this was said, the clouds suddenly appeared to open, and such a 
deluge
of rain descended, that the earth seemed to smoke.  The drops appeared to be
continuous small spouts of water -- a shower is too mild a word -- it was a
deluging, as if some waterspout had burst.

     The men stood a moment or two, but it was useless to work; they could 
not
do it, and they rushed to a part of the wall which sheltered them from the
fury of the storm that was raging.

     "Well, I never saw anything like this before."

     "Nor I.  Hark at the thunder!  There's a flash!  Who would have 
expected
that at this season of the year?"

     "Not I."

     "Nor any one else; but it seems to me as if we were to be defeated
to-night.  I am sorry we made the attempt, since we are sure to find the 
yard
watched after this, for they will see what we have been up to."

     "Yes, it is vexing, but we cannot help this; it is quite impossible to 
do
anything in such weather as this.  I do not care about a wet jacket, but I
cannot see, and hardly breathe, with so much falling water about me."

     "Nor I; but yet I am loth to give it up; Consider the jewellery and 
money
he had about him-- it will pay us handsomely."

     "Well, it was a strange start of him, at all events.  I wonder how he
came to be buried in such a manner-- how was it?"

     "I don't know.  All I know is, that the thing was kept secret because 
it
was considered that it would be a temptation to disturb any grave when it 
was
known that he was buried in his clothes and jewellery, and that his money 
was
buried also with him.  It was certainly a tempation [sic] I could not 
resist."

     "Are you sure?"

     "Yes; I will tell you, another time, how I came to know all about it;
indeed, I saw him screwed down, and the consequence is, I know that he has 
the
money and valuables about him."

     "Then I am sure we had better get into the church itself; we can do 
more
with your slab of marble than on the outside of the wall.  And besides that, 
I
do not think that this rain will give over; the hole we have already made is
fast filling up with water, and we shall find it impossible to work."

     "So we shall.  What do you say to getting inside the cathedral?"

     "Agreed, my lads; as quickly as you like; for, if we stay here much
longer, we shall certainly be drowned.  I'm wet through as it is."

     "So am I; but never mind, my boys, bright gold and jewels will warm 
your
hearts, and that will keep your outsides dry, or at least you will not feel
it.  I am sure that I should not if I can but get it."

     "Ay, that is all I care about; but, if you get foiled, you may depend
upon it you don't feel any the better-- you are rather worse, and feel
everything more; but what do you say to yon window?"

     "That will do if we can reach it: that is my only difficulty."

     "That is one that is easily overcome," said his companion, "for I know
where the ladder is, and that is just over our heads; all you have to do is 
to
put the point of the crow-bar under the staple to which the chain is 
fastened
that secures it, and then you have the means at once of entering."

     "But if we get in and are detected, how shall we get out again?"

     "Are we not three to one?  If the old verger should come, I think we
could make a dead body of him in a very short while; and I cannot tell where
you will be if you can't get the better of the old man."

     "Well, say no more about it; up with the ladder, and we will get in and
chance it.  Such a night as this, it would be strange, indeed, if anybody
heard us; but, as there is much to be got, why, we can't grumble at the 
risk."

     The three men set to work about wrenching the staple out to which was
attached a chain which secured the ladder.  That was soon effected, and the
ladder placed against one of the lowermost windows, and then one of the men
went up, and forcing the window open said, after he had looked in, --

     "All right-- come up.  We have got to a right place."

     They all three came up one after another, when the first up crept in at
the open aperture, and by means of ornamental work, and a monument that 
there
projected from the wall in a manner that enabled them to descend with ease,
and in a few moments more the whole three stood in the old cathedral of
Winchester.

     At that moment the bell tolled heavily the hour of twelve.  The sound 
was
solemn, and it made a deep impression upon the robbers.

     "What a dismal, hollow sound that has, to be sure," said one.

     "Yea; it sounded like tolling."

     "Pshaw!" said one of them; "'tis no matter-- if it be tolling, it is 
not
for us, nor for the man we come to visit, so no more old women's fears; if 
you
don't like stopping in this place, you had better set to work and be quick,
when we shall have no further need of staying.  Of what use is it for you to
stare and gape about with white faces, and swelled eyeballs, like so many
cats; be men-- be active, and use you arms."

     "Well, where are we to use them?  What are we to do?  You brought us
here, and yet you do not tell us what we are to do.  You know all about this
matter, and you cannot, or do not point out where we are to commence."

     "Here, then; on the very stone you are standing; set to work to raise
this, and then we shall soon find our way into the vaults below, and we 
shall
then satisfy ourselves for our trouble, and be well paid too, I hope."

     "I hope so, too, Josh; for, to tell you the truth, I don't ever 
recollect
so uncomfortable a job as that which I am in to-night."

     "Well, you ain't got paid all, I'll warrant."

     "I haven't got paid at all, yet; but we waste time; lend me a pick.  I
don't see how I am to get a tool in here.  The chinks are all so small, that
you can hardly put in the blade of a penknife."

     "There is a hole somewhere near the head.  There is a small piece of
black marble."

     "Yes; here it is."

     "Well, chip that out, and then you may insert a crow-bar, or pick,
beneath the stone, when you will find that it will lift up, and then, by 
main
strength, lift it back, and we may go down."

     These instructions were followed out.  The black marble was discovered,
and then knocked out, when a large crevice was discovered, into which a
powerful crow-bar was immediately thrust; and then, by one united effort, 
they
contrived to lift the marble slab up out of its place, though not above a
foot, which required a great effort, when it is considered that it was
imbedded in cement.

     "Well, we shall be able to get it up now, I think."

     "Don't be too sure, for we have not got it far-- it is enormously 
heavy,
and the lever has done all as yet."

     "Well, then, are you all ready?  A long pull, you know, comrades, and a
strong pull, does the business.  Now, then, altogether."

     "Heave, ho!" whispered another, and they all three made a prodigious
effort.  It was not only a strong pull, but a very long pull, for the stone
was so heavy, it came slowly and unwillngly upwards, and it was nearly three
minutes before the enormous mass stood upright in the aisle.

     "Well, I didn't think it would have been done.  That's the hardest job
that ever I had a hand in, and don't desire to have such another, but yet,
hard as it is, it is easier than what we had to do outside."

     "Yes, much, and you will soon find it is so.  Lend a hand to clear away
the rubbish that lies here; there's a trap-door underneath that leads into 
the
vaults; it belonged to the monks of old, of whom it is said it served either
for the same purpose of burial, or for a cellar for wine."

     "Well, well, there are some things better than wine, I trow, in the
cellar, now, if we can find the coffin; there has been no other burial in 
the
vaults since he was buried, so we shall not have much trouble."

     "But what are we to do with the stone?  If we let it down again, we 
shall
do some mischief."

     "We must turn it corner by corner until we get it against the pillars,
and there leave it; for if we let it down, it will go down like the report 
of
a gun, and smash all that comes in the way."

     This was agreed to, and it was not long before they propped the heavy
mass of stone against one of the pillars, and then returned to the place 
where
it had been raised, and began to clear away the rubbish, when a trap-door 
was
plainly observable; and after much labour and force, they contrived to open
the door, when there appeared a dark aperture, into which they could not 
look
without some misgivings, for nothing could be seen.

     "Well, who's to go down?"

     This was a question that no one liked to answer.  And certainly no one
would volunteer to go below.  It was too dark to be inviting, and the men
looked at one another as well as they could, for it was total darkness, or
nearly so, in the aisle; and below, it was so utterly dark, that it was
impossible to make out anything.

     "What is to be done now?  Have you got the lantern?"

     "I have, and matches, but did not think we ought to use them before, 
lest
we attract attention; however, we will have a light now, and should anybody
look down, they will think there is a general meeting among the dead."

     So saying, he lit the lantern, which threw a light into the vault, and
rendered visible a flight of steps that ran up to the opening, but which 
were
invisible in the darkness that had reigned in the place.

     "Now, then, jump down, and see where the last coffin is placed; it is
easily known from all the others, for I don't think there has been a burial
here for many months-- the old cathedral is not often disturbed for the
reception of the dead, and only when some rich man dies and fancies he may 
lie
more comfortable here."

     "Ay, rich men can afford to be buried in a good suit of clothes, and
money in their pocket, to bribe St. Peter to open the gate."

     "Ha! ha! ha! well said; Peter has the keys."

     "Yes, and here we have the coffin."

     "Have we?  Is this it?"

     "Yes; don't you see that it has all the signs of newness about it?  
There
is hardly any dust collected upon it; here we shall find our treasure; the
coffin is a stong one, and will, I think, take some trouble to break open."

     "Indeed!  We shall be choked with the horrible stench which we have
below.  I can't stand it another minute-- I shall be sick."

     "Ay, and I too."

     "Here, then, I have the lantern.  Lay hold of the coffin and bring it 
up
stairs; we can carry it amongst us."

     "Ay, anything but remain here-- that I cannot do."

     "Be quick, for confound me, but such a mass of putrid flesh as there 
must
be here, is horribly sickly.  I would sooner be hanged than pass an hour
here."

     "I'm not so afraid of death as all that.  I could manage to live 
through
a night."

     "You might, but you would soon find out the ill effects, and die of 
some
fever or other; and that is what we shall have, if we remain here much
longer."

     The three men then shifted the coffin from its place, and then on to
their shoulders, one at either end, and one under the centre.

     The coffin was heavy -- very heavy, and the men were tottering under
their burden.  They were strong men, but hardly equal to the task of 
carrying
so dead a weight; but yet they never shrank from it, but, with slow and
unsteady steps, they gradually neared the stairs that led upwards.  They
paused.  If it was a task beore, it was worse now.  What more exertion could
they make?

     "Do you think the steps will hold us?" said one.

     "I'm sure I cannot say; and perhaps not."

     "I think they are rotten, or partially so; what do you say?  How shall 
we
get the body up?"

     "There is a rope, is there not?"

     "Yes."

     "That will do then.  I will get that; by its means we may hoist the
coffin up to the stone pavement above.  I'm almost sick."

     "And I too.  This place is enought to breed a pestilence in a town."

     The smell in the vaults was certainly very strong and very pernicious.
The foetid odour that rose from the vaults was especially disagreeable; the
smell that comes from the accumulated and putrefying remains of human 
bodies,
is of all odours the most noisome, and, to our tastes, the worst.

     Right glad were the men, who had propped the coffin up against the
ladder, to get up into the aisle above, to breathe a less impure atmosphere.
They gasped again; and one of them climbed up the monument, to get to the 
open
window, at which they had entered, to inhale some of the pure moistened air;
and then, after a few inspirations, he returned, at the call of his comrades
to aid them.

     The rope was procured and secured round the coffin, and one man 
remained
below to guide it, while the two others remained above to haul up the rope,
which would bring the body, coffin and all, to the top.

     "Well, Josh, how goes the storm?"

     "It is blowing over, I think; it does not rain, and it is breaking.  I
shouldn't wonder if we don't have moonlight after all, and, if we should, we
shall have a trouble to get away unperceived."

     "You forget what hour it is."

     "Hark! there are the chimes."

     The four quarters now chimed from the great clock, and sounded solemnly
and mournfully in the dead of the night.  The iron tongue struck one, and 
the
last sounds of the clock died away before any of the men moved or spoke.

     "Well, we have been here an hour, and nearly two hours since our first
commencement.  It's nearly time, I'm thinking."

     "Yes," said the man below." [sic]

     "Heave ho!" called out the leader of the gang, in a low voice.

     The two men at the top hauled at the rope, while he below pushed the
coffin up with all his strength, and after a time they succeeded in causing 
it
to rise about a foot, or something less, at each haul, and as it got higher,
the man below could the better apply his strength to it, and at length it 
came
up to the top.

     Here, however, they experienced another difficulty.  It was hard to 
pull
up so high as to enable them to throw its weight on the pavement, and the 
rope
was almost useless as a means of pulling it up higher, and the only one who
had it in his power effectually to apply his strength, was the man below.
However, after a while, to their great relief, the coffin lay fairly upon 
the
stone pavement.

     "A good job done!"

     "So say I, Josh; and such another would completely finish me for the
night.  I might lie down and defy the world."

     "How about the coffin-- there is no time to rest.  I have a small flask
of rum in my pocket, which we will discuss as soon as we have broken open 
the
coffin, which I expect is the last hard job we shall have."

     "And a hard job it would have been, had I not come provided with a
screwdriver-- one that is used by undertakers in such work."

     "Set to work-- good luck to you.  I am quite dry, and quite tired too,
and the sooner this is over the better.  There, the screws come out easily
enough, though they are long and hold firm."

     "Yes, they go deep; but they have a wide worm, that carries them down 
or
brings them up so quickly."

     In a few minutes more the whole of the screws were drawn, and the lid 
of
the coffin was thrown on one side, and the corpse was at once discovered to
them.  It lay calm and quiet; but yet it was terrible to look at.  The 
living
man had been tall-- remarkably tall, as well as remarkable-looking.

     He was dressed as if for walking.  It was strange, the corpse was
apparelled as if were in life; and this, perhaps, caused the extreme 
paleness
-- even extreme for a corpse -- to be so apparent that they spoke not, but
gazed in silence upon it, until at length one of them said, --

     "Put out the light.  We have the moon's rays-- at least there is enough
to enable us to see what we want, and the light is dangerous."

     The light was put out, and the subdued light of the moon rendered all
apparent enough to the robbers.

     The storm had lulled and altogether ceased, while they had been busy in
the vaults and getting up the body, and now it was a perfect calm.  The 
moon,
though obscured at the moment, promised to shed her rays upon the earth; and
as it was at the full, and the clouds clearing off, the probability was that
the town would become as light as day.

     "There he is," said one of the men.

     "Yes; and about as ugly a chap as ever I saw."

     "He is no beauty: but he's been a fine man."

     "If you mean tall, I dare say you are right; but he's not fine as I 
take
it.  He's not quite full enough about the chest and shoulders."

     "He's got some fine rings, and a gold watch and chain.  Well, there is 
a
good ten or fifteen pounds each, and if his pockets are well lined, why, he
will afford us a tolerable good booty."

     "Yes; we must not complain.  Shall we replace all?"

     "It is not possible to do so, either in time to enable us to escape, or
to do it so as to escape detection.  Besides, there would be no use in it.
See how bright the moon is getting.  We shall have as much to do as we shall
get through to escape being seen.  I am sure we shall run a great risk."

     "I think so too."

     "Well, then, commence proceedings.  Ha!"

     The moonbeams had fallen upon the corpse just as he was speaking, and 
he
thought he observed a motion in the body.

     "What is the matter, Josh?"

     "Didn't you think he moved."

     "Ha! ha! ha! dead! ha! ha! ha! dead moved-- buried moved-- ha! ha! ha!
Eh? why-- oh-- it's all fancy; you'll see me believe it, presently.  I do
declare-- well, a man dead and buried-- I suppose a week."

     "No."

     "I think so----"

     "Well, it does not matter much how long he has been buried; but he 
can't
move unless you move him.  D----n!"

     As he spoke he started to his feet, and his hair began to straighten, 
and
his limbs quiver, and yet he appeared to think he might be mistaken; for he
endeavoured to speak to his companions; pointing to the corpse, he contrived
to say,

     "I-- 'l-- 'l take the j--j--jewels; he-- he-- he moves."

     "Eh?  Well, I told you I thought so, but you said no, and only laughed 
at
me for doing so; but stand on one side, and let the moonlight come upon him,
we can tell better then if he really does move; though, notwithstanding all 
I
saw, I am inclined to believe it is quite an impossibility; but the more 
light
we have the better we shall be able to tell how the mistake arose."

     "I thought I saw his eyes move."

     As he spoke he moved on the side, as he had been standing between the
corpse and the moon's rays, and for the most part intercepted them; but the
moment that he did move away, and the rays came full upon the corpse, a
shivering motion appeared to pervade it, to the intense horror of the 
robbers,
who could not believe what they saw, but believed they were yet mistaken,
though they were too much terrified to speak or even move.  They stood 
gazing
upon the body with bursting eyes and gaping mouth, as if they had suddenly
become spell-bound by the wand of some magician.

     Presently the corpse opened his eyes and glared full at them.  Oh, such
glistening, lead-like orbs, that froze the very current of their blood; they
knew not what to think, but when the body turned on one side, towards the
moon's rays, all doubt vanished and the spell was broken.

     "The devil, by--!" exclaimed Josh.

     Not another word was uttered by either of the other two; but they 
sprang
like emancipated madmen up the slippery sides of the monument, and out at 
the
windows, as easily as a fly can run up a wall.  It did not occupy more than 
a
few seconds to enable them to clear the place.  Half a minute had not 
elapsed
before they stood shivering by the beautiful old cross, at Winchester.

              *               *               *               *

     The corpse in the cathedral, which mysteriously became animated when
exposed to the moonlight, turned towards the moon's rays and gazed upon the
flying and terrified robbers, who had just exhumed him.

     No word passed his lips, and he looked around him for some time in
silence, upon the scene before him.

     The moon came in at the tall windows of the cathedral, throwing long
streams of silvery light upon the stone flooring, and upon some of the
monuments that were erected by the pillars, or columns that rise to the 
roof.

     All was silent, all was still-- no movement was discernible, save in 
the
form that now sat up, and leaned on his elbow in his coffin; and he but 
turned
his head slowly from side to side, as though he were meditating upon the
lovely and solemn beauty of the place.

     At length he arose, but he appeared to move with extreme difficulty, 
and
once or twice he placed his hand in the region of the heart, as if he felt
something there that pained him, and tottered about; but seemed to recover
himself a little after a time, and muttered to himself, in low but distinct
tones, --

     "I must have been another victim; I am weak, the vital action is 
languid,
and my veins are empty; I must satisfy the instinct of my nature, and 
another
victim must restore me to life and the world for a season."

     He looke up towards the window, gave one look around him and on the
coffin, while a shudder passed though him; and then, gazing on himself and
feeling for his valuables, he slowly clambered up the monument, and 
carefully
got through the window, and thence into the open air, and he finally
disappeared from Winchester churchyard.

 Next Time: The Star Hotel, and the Stranger's Arrival. -- A Remarkable
 Countenance. -- The Illness and Death of the Stranger. -- A Strange Request
 Complied With.



                            CHAPTER CXXXIV. [sic]

                               [Chapter 144]

THE STAR HOTEL, AND THE STRANGER'S ARRIVAL. -- A REMARKABLE COUNTENANCE. --
THE ILLNESS AND DEATH OF THE STRANGER. -- A STRANGE REQUEST  COMPLIED WITH.


     Some days previous to the scene related in the previous chapter, the
London coach drove up opposite to the Star Hotel, and, as usual, out came a
couple of waiters to see what there was from the metropolis, in the shape of 
a
passenger, who might become an inmate of the hotel, and a customer, of 
course.

     "Now, then, Billy," said the guard, a stout, good-humoured fellow, to a
very stiff and punctilious waiter, dressed in black, with a white 
neckerchief.

     "My good friend, my name is William, if you must be familiar, though I 
am
sure I don't number you among my acquaintances."

     "Very good, Billy.  I declare you are one of the politest waiters that 
is
to be found between Portsmouth and London; ay, and more than that, you are
_the_ politest.  Didn't you say you were edicated [sic] among a lot of gals-
-
young ladies, I mean?"

     "I never held any discourse, relative to my early days, with you, my
friend; I am not, just this moment, aware of it."

     "Ah!  I see you are too polite to pass an east wind without taking your
hat off to it; how do they when they have none?"

     "Have you anybody for us?" said William, mildly.

     "Yes, my pink, I have."

     "Who is he, and where is he?  I must not waste my master's time; it is 
an
impropriety I am especially anxious to avoid."

     "You needn't be in a hurry, nevertheless, especially as I see he is
fumbling about for small change; but what will you say if I introduce a
customer to you, a good six foot high, and perhaps a little to spare; and 
the
colour of a well scraped horse-radish?  Eh? what do you say to that, my
promrose?"

     William did not know what to say, but, after a moment's hesitation, he
said,

     "We don't charge our customers by the room they take, or by their
personal appearance.  A gentleman is a gentleman, Mr. Guard, all the same,
whether he have a red face or a white one."

     "Well, that's good, Billy; but the chief thing is, after all, of what
colour is his money, and how he parts with it; eh?"

     The guard winked and William's impassive features were lit up with a
spark of intelligence and vivacity, which, however, was only transient, and 
he
relapsed into his old state of extreme and unimpeachable gentility.

     "Hold your tongue, Billy; here he comes."

     At that moment the gentleman pulled down the window, and said to the
guard,

     "Open the door, if you please; I shall get out here."

     "Yes, sir," said the guard, who immediately obeyed the injunction; and 
a
tall, but awfully pale individual descended the steps, wrapped up in a huge
coak, so that but little of his person was seen, or features either; what
little there was visible was not prepossessing by any means by the colour.

     "This is the Star?" said the stranger, inquiringly.

     "Yes," said the guard.

     "I'll stop here.  Are you the waiter?" said he, addressing William.

     "I am, sir," said William.  "Will you walk this way, sir?"

     "Yes; show me into a private apartment-- let me have a good fire, for I
am exceedingly cold."

     William immediately took him into a room where there was a fire, 
saying,
--

     "If you please to remain here, sir, we will make you a fire and warm 
the
room; and, as you are cold, perhaps you will prefer this to going into a 
room
without a fire there already lighted for your reception."

     "Certainly, I much prefer it."

     "Would you like to take any refreshment, sir?" inquired William.

     "Not now," replied the stranger, in mild accents.

     William left the room, muttering to himself, --

     "Well, he deserves to be a prince; he is as mild and gentlemanly as a
prince.  I vow I never heard any one speak in such a tone, and with so much
amiable condescension.  What a pity he is so white-- at least, that he is 
so,
I only infer from the nose, and part of the forehead and cheeks around the
eyes-- these being the only parts that I have noticed; he is, indeed, not 
much
unlike, in colour, to the guard's vulgar simile-- a well scraped horse-
radish.
I never saw white so opaque and dead before."

     While those thoughts passed through the mind of William, he saw that 
the
apartment was placed in readiness for the stranger's reception, and placed
himself in communication with the proprietor, and obtained his orders; he 
then
returned to the stranger, and conducted him to his proper apartment, and 
then
awaited his commands.

     The stranger gave him some orders, which were at once executed, and 
then
he said, --

     "I shall sleep here, of course."

     "Yes, sir," said William.

     "I am very particular about my beds-- I must have my bed well and
thoroughly aired."

     "Oh, yes, sir," said William; "we always----"

     "Never mind, never mind all that," said the stranger, blandly.  "Never
mind all that; I know what you would say.  All your beds are always aired.
Well, be it so-- I have no desire to dispute it-- but I once slept in a damp
bed-- I fell ill, and have never entirely recovered from it."

     "Oh, that makes him look so horrible pale," thought William.

     "So you perceive, my friend, that I have cause to be particular, and,
therefore, you will excuse me when I inquire minutely into the character of
the beds."

     "Oh, certainly, sir-- certainly, sir."

     "Then you will see that my bed is aired, will you not?"

     "Yes, sir, I will take care that it is especially aired; and, if you
approve of my doing so, sir, I will have a fire lit in your bed-room."

     "If you please.  If you will do all this, you will greatly oblige me.
Are there any females in the family?"

     "Yes, sir; the servants," said William, fearing some impropriety was
meant.

     "Oh, the servants; and no others?"

     "None," said William, quite suddenly.

     "Oh, yes, that is right-- none but the servants.  Then my requests will
not put you to any serious inconvenience?"

     "Not in the least, sir," said William, pleased to find that the females
had only been inquired about for fear of annoying them.

     The stranger sat up in his room, and appeared to be very ill, and ate 
and
drank but little, though he ordered whatever was requisite for a liberal
individual; and, though taken away untouched, yet it was clearly understood 
he
would have to pay for it.

     The bed was used and approved of, and the tall remarkable looking
stranger expressed himself satisfied to the proprietor of the hotel, who 
came
to inquire if he should desire anything more or different from what was
already done.

     This was at once answered in the negative, and the proprietor retreated
by no means prepossessed in the stranger's personal appearance, which was
remarkable to a degree -- that was noticed by every one in the hotel.

     "Winchester is an old town-- a city-- sir," said the proprietor, by way
of entering into a conversation with his guest.

     "Yes, very old," said his guest.

     "And the cathedral, sir, has been built in part ever since the Saxon
times, and then increased by the Normans."

     "Ay, it is very beautiful; one could wish to lie there, it is so calm 
and
beautiful," said the stranger, with a shudder, which he endeavoured to
suppress; and then he added, "The grave-yard is quiet and retired."

     "Yes, sir.  You have been in Winchester before?"

     "I have," replied the stranger.

     Finding any further attempt at conversation likely to appear intrusive,
the landlord quitted the apartment with a bow, which was condescendingly
returned by the guest, who folded his hands one over the other, and turned
towards the fire, upon which he gazed thoughtfully for some time in silence.

     The strange and ghastly-looking countenance of the stranger had created
quite a sensation among the individuals at the hotel, all of them declaring
they never heard of, or saw anything equal to it in all their lives.  But
what was it?  How did it happen so?  They had seen dead men, but they had
never seen any so ghastly and so fearfully pale.

     "He doesn't seem long for this world," said one of them.

     "If you had said he didn't belong to this world," said another, "I 
should
almost have been inclined to believe you."

     "He does look like a corpse," added an old woman.

     "Yes, and what a tooth he has projecting out in front.  Upon my word I
never saw his like."

     "And I," said another, "never beheld such eyes.  Why, he is scarcely
human.  Such eyes as those I scarcely wish to look at again."

     "He always appears to me to be in some dreadful agony," said the cook;
"he really looks as if he had a perpetual pain in his stomach, and had eaten
something that had disagreed with him."

     There was some truth in this last assertion, for the stranger always 
did
appear as if suffering from some internal pain -- mental or physical, or 
both
-- and it was soon seen that he was rapidly losing strength, and could
scarcely walk abroad.

     The cause of all this none could tell; possibly, it was only a sudden
illness, or perhaps it was a long affliction, to which he was used to, and
hence the terrible expression upon his countenance, which appeared as if it
had never been otherwise, so deep and so settled was the expression of pain.

          *          *          *          *          *          *

     The stranger appeared anxious to get out, but was unable to do so; he
could just walk across the room several times in the day, but was unable to
get down stairs; and whenever he attempted to do so, he sunk down, his limbs
losing the power of sustaining his weight.

     "I can go no further," he muttered to himself, as he endeavoured to 
walk
down stairs; "I am lost."

     As he spoke, a truly horrible expression came across his countenance,
that made William, who came to his aid, step back terrified.

     "You-- you are ill, sir," he said, in somewhat uncertain accents.

     "I am ill," he replied, "very ill."

     "Will you allow me to help you up, sir, to your room?"

     "If you please," said the stranger, who was endeavouring to rise by the
aid of the bannisters; and by these, and with William's assistance, he got 
up;
and then, with some difficulty, he reached up stairs -- his own bed-room.

     "I will send master immediately, sir."

     "You need not be in any hurry," said the stranger.  "I do not desire 
his
presence."

     However, William left the stranger to seek his master; and when he 
found
him, he said, --

     "Oh, sir, the strange-looking gentleman in No. 5 is very ill."

     "Is he, William?  What is the matter with him?"

     "I am sure I don't know, sir; he sank down on the stairs just now, and
could only get up to his room again by my help."

     "Something serious I think, then.  I thought he appeared ill when first 
I
saw him, from the expression of his countenance."

     "Yes, sir; 'tis very strange."

     "Very," said the landlord, thoughtfully.  "I'll go and see him; but, in
the mean time, you had better send for Doctor Linton, who knows me, and will
come at once."

     "Yes, sir," said William.

     The landlord immediately sought the stranger's apartment, which he
entered without any ceremony, and advanced to the bed in which the stranger
lay; and, upon his first glance at the occupant, the landlord stepped back 
in
affright, so truly terrible did the countenance of the stranger appear.

     "Ah," said the stranger, as he turned his glassy eyes upon him.

     "I-- I-- I have come to see you," stammered the landlord.  "I have come
to see you; my servant informed me you were ill, sir."

     "I am very ill."

     "I feared so, and I have sent for Doctor Linton, who will be here
immediately."

     "It is of no consequence; I believe, I am too far gone to recover."
Another horrible spasm passed across his countenance.

     "What does your illness arise from?"

     "Decay of the system.  I want renovating," said the stranger.

     The landlord paused; he didn't understand this at all, for the stranger
did not bear the appearance of decay about him.  He was tall, and seemingly 
of
the middle age, he thought, and nothing about him to savour of decay, save,
indeed, the terrible and [r]emarkable paleness which his flesh appeared to
bear; and his system generally, in other respects, bore nothing of the
appearance of general decay.

     "Shall I send for any one, sir?  Have you any friends I could write to
for you?"

     "None, sir, thank you," replied the stranger, who, however, bated 
nothing
of his politeness, even in his present position.

     "Have you any desire to see any one in particular?"

     "No one, I thank you."

     At that moment Doctor Linton was announced, and the proprietor having
introduced him, left the apartment, leaving the doctor and his patient
together; the former at once perceived, and wondered at his extraordinary
paleness.  After a few preliminary questions, he appeared quite puzzled, and
said to him, --

     "May I inquire what is the cause of this extraordinary complexion?"

     "Certanly," said the stranger; "it was caused by damp beds."

     "Damp beds," muttered the doctor, amazed, and hardly comprehending what
was said, or the nature of the reply; he was at a loss, but did not say so,
what was the connexion between cause and effect.

     "Yes, damp beds," said the stranger.

     "Have you ever suffered in this way before?" inquired the surgeon.

     "Yes, more than once."

     "And you have recovered?" said the doctor, abstractedly.

     "I am here," said the stranger, mildly.

     "Truly, you are," said the the surgeon.  "I had almost forgotten that,
your case is so singular.  You [sic] pulse is very low and irregular."

     "It is," coolly replied the stranger; but immediately a kind of spasm
shot across him, as he had before exhibited to the landlord.

     "Do you feel much pain? -- does that often happen?"

     "No, only occasionally.  I don't think you are at all likely to benefit
me, sir," said the stranger, with much courtsey in his manner.  "I do not 
mean
any disrespect to you; but my complaint is a fatal one in our family."

     "Are you all afflicted in this manner?"

     "Yes, all before me died," replied the stranger; "and when it does come
on, we have no means of avoiding the end that approaches; there is no 
medical
aid that can be rendered, ever did us any good."

     "You are quite an exception to nature, sir," said the medical man, 
"quite
an exception.  Your case cannot be beyond the assistance of medicine-- if 
not
to cure, to ameliorate-- though its nature may not be ascertained; but if we
could do so, we could tell you what we might be able to do."

     "That has been attempted before," said the stranger, mildly; "and hence
it is I am loth to give you needless trouble."

     "Well, I will call upon you, and see you again; but you ought to take
some medicine.  I am persuaded that it is some great and extraordinary
derangement of the system-- a complete sinking of the whole system."

     "Most undoubtedly it is a sinking in the whole system-- a sinking which
has never yet been stopped by human aid.  But you can pursue what course you
may deem proper."

     "Will you take medicines if I send any?"

     "Yes," replied the patient; "I will take them when you choose to send
them."

     "I will endeavour to send you something that shall infuse something 
like
vitality into the system, that will indeed help you to rally."

     "That will, indeed, be doing something more than was ever yet done by 
any
one who attended any individual of our family.  I feel I am very weak, and 
am
sinking fast, and do not expect that I shall again have the honour of seeing
you."

     As he again spoke, the same spasm seized upon him; his frame was
convulsed for more than an minute, and his pallid features appeared to give
forth expressions which it was impossible to describe.

     The doctor paused, and gazed with something like fear and awe upon him.
He had never before seen such a case so destitute of facts, nor yet such a
man; it was quite beyond his experience; there was nothing like it in all 
his
previous experience; there was no apparent cause for all that he saw.  It
might be some severe chronic disorder which did not manifest itself 
outwardly.
If this were the case, it was most extraordinary.

     But more extraordinary than all was, apart from the medical question, 
the
strange and terrible appearance of the stranger; his paleness -- the 
terrible
expression of his features -- the strange, and even revolting cast of his
eyes, that completely baffled all his attempts to understand them, or to
remember anything he had ever heard of, or seen.

     The stranger languidly turned in his bed, and then closed his eyes,
leaving his medical attendant to his reflections.

     "Well," muttered Doctor Linton, as he looked at his incomprehensible
patient.  "I never met with so fearful a human puzzle before.  I never saw
such an expression of countenance in all my life; nor did ever I meet with
such a case.  Had he been one of the fabled monsters of old, the creation of
the German mind, he could not have been more unlike a human being, to wear a
human form.

     As he spoke, he quitted the room, and made his way to the proprietor of
the hotel, who was as anxiously waiting to see him, as he was to meet him.

     "Well, doctor, what do you think of the patient?"

     "Why, I don't know what to think.  I never saw such a man before in all
my life-- I cannot make him out."

     "Nor I.  I can't understand what he means or what he is."

     "Nor anybody else.  But he is quite a gentleman; and yet there is
something very frightful to be seen in him.  I don't know why it is, I don't
care about going oftener to him than I am obliged."

     "I don't doubt it.  There was something in the feel of his hand more 
like
a corpse than anything I ever felt before."

     "Indeed-- it is a queer affair."

     "Do you know him?"

     "No, I do not," replied the proprietor.  "He has not been here more 
than
two days; and when he entered he had that deadly paleness which he has now."

     "Did he indeed.  It is, I dare say, natural to him, though it must 
create
an unpleasant sensation, go where he would."

     "He must feel it to be so, no doubt; but, at the same time, he could 
not
avoid it.  Have you come to any conclusion respecting his complaint?"

     "I have not indeed; I will send him some medicine; though, to tell you
the truth, I can hardly tell what is the matter with him.  His disorder 
seems
to consist of a rapid sinking of the whole system, accompanied by a few 
minor
symptoms, and a spasm, which must be very painful; for it produces an
extraordinary effect upon his visage, and his eyes glisten like a piece of
tin."

     "That's it, doctor.  Do you know, I have been thinking for something to
which I could liken those eyes to, but could not do it.  When do you see him
again?"

     "To-morrow, some time; in the mean time I must bid you good day, for my
presence is wanted in the Dundrum family."

     "Oh, have you any of them for a patient?"

     "Yes, two.  Good day-- good day."

     "Good day, doctor," said the proprietor of the hotel, as he bowed the
doctor out? [sic] and then, returning to his own apartment, he wondered, in
his own mind, at all that had been said by that learned individual, when
William entered his room with a hastiness of manner quite unusual to him.

     "What is the matter, Willam?"

     "Oh, sir-- I beg your pardon-- but the strange gentleman----"

     "Eh! -- Well! -- What?"

     "Why, he's dying, and wants to see you, sir."

     "To see me, William-- and dying!"

     "Yes, sir-- it's very sudden-- but good Lord, how dreadful he looks.  
He
clasped his hands and shook-- it made the bed shake and the windows rattle,
just as if an earthquake were taking place."

     "Goodness me!" muttered the proprietor, who immediately quitted the
apartment, and followed William to that of the stranger, who lay in the same
attitude as that described by William; but he was evidently endeavouring to
repress all nervous emotion, and by the time he was spoken to, he succeeded 
in
this endeavour completely, and lay apparently calm and collected for the
landlord's appearance.

     "I believe you sent for me," said that worthy, in a subdued tone.

     "Yes; I wish to speak a word to you before I die."

     "Die!" said the landlord, with a start.  "No, no, you cannot mean that-
-
you will get better-- you are deceived."

     "No, no; do not endeavour to persuade me from believing what I know is
the truth.  I shall die, and that, too, before many hours."

     "If the case is so urgent, let me send to Mr. Linton; he cannot have 
gone
far, and he will return."

     "Nay, do not do that; his aid is utterly useless-- utterly."

     "He is a clever man; but still, if your own feelings tell you that you
can't live, allow me to send for a clergyman."

     "My friend," said the stranger, "I have settled all that in my own 
mind.
My affairs are all made up, my account is cast, and I shall learn the 
balance
where I am going to.  I wish, while I have breath, to beg a favour of you."

     "Anything on earth that I can do, I will," said the landlord.

     "Nay, I do not desire-- all-- that-- I-- I only want you to-- to-- to--
promise me you'll-- attend to my funeral."

     "All shall be done as you desire."

     "My breath-- I feel it going.  I have money enough about me; you will
find in my pocket-book and purse, a certain sum."

     "Yes, sir-- yes."

     "And with that you will have the goodness to liquidate my debt to
yourself, my funeral expenses, and place the residue of that sum about my
person."

     "When you are dead!" exclaimed the landlord.

     "Yes; will you promise me-- will you swear to see it done?"

     "Yes, I will-- I do swear."

     "See you keep the oath; my breath is going fast-- my strength is 
leaving
me-- and-- and----"

     "I will do all." said the landlord again.  "Will you have any friend
attend your funeral obsequies?  It's melancholy, but I am obliged to speak 
of
it to you, because I cannot otherwise know your wishes."

     "Do not mind that," said the stranger, turning towards the landlord; 
"but
when I am dead, dress me in my clothes, just as if I were about to walk; let
me have all my property and my money-- such of it as remains after paying 
all
charges-- the remainder cause to be placed about my person-- in fact, all 
that
belongs to me; and place-- me-- and place me-- me-- me----"

     "Where-- where would you be burried?" said the landlord.

     "Place me," gasped the dying man; "place me in the-- the----"

     A gurgling noise, succeeded by a sharp rattle in the throat, was all 
the
sound that escaped him, while his glazed eyes were fixed, with a truly
horrifying expression, upon the features of the landlord, whose presence of
mind appeared to forsake him, and he exclaimed, falling on his knees in
affright, --

     "Lord, have mercy upon us, what a dreadful affair!"

     "Horrible, sir," said William.

     "Oh! are you here, William?" inquired the landlord.

     "Yes, sir," replied that individual.

     "Oh, I'm glad of that; did you see him die?"

     "I did, sir.  How dreadful!"

     "Very; but I am glad you were here because he has made some singular
requests about burying him, and in a certain manner, with all his clothes on
and his jewels and money about him.  Now I should be considered foolish if I
did anything of the kind; but I have promised, and as he has no friends, I
will do what I have promised."

     "It is very good of you, sir; though I think he has been very silly in
making such a request; yet you cannot be so considered for performing the 
wish
of a dying man; it is the duty of any one so promising to perform it."

     "Quite right, William, quite right; but did you understand what he 
meant
by his last words?  I mean, where he wished to be buried."

     "I don't know positively, sir, but I think he meant the cathedral-- I
thought so, at least.  I am not sure he said so, but I believe he meant to 
do
so."

     "Well, I think so myself; and in the cathedral he shall be buried; but 
it
is a terrible-looking corpse.  I sure [sic] I could not sleep in the same 
room
with him.  Poor fellow!  What he'll come to at last there is no telling."

     "Yes, sir; he does look dreadful."

     "You needn't tell anybody we have a dead customer in the hotel, 
William."

     "No, sir."

     "Because people might be curious, and wish to see him, and if they were
to do so, I am sure they would leave the house."

     "So they would, sir.  He's a dreadful-looking corpse.  I never heard of
such a one.  What can be the cause of it? -- and to be buried in his 
clothes,
too!"

     "Ay, and his money and his jewels; that is very strange!"

     "Very strange, sir, indeed; and the fewer persons who know of it the
better, else the body will not lie very long in its grave.  There will be
those who would not mind turning resurrection-men for the value of what he 
had
about him."

     "So there would be, William; and now I think of it, the authorities of
the cathedral shall know nothing about it; for who can tell what fancy they
may take concerning it being an unchristian burial?"

     "And yet, sir, he paid all his debts like a Christian."

     "Yes; and left a remembrance for the waiter."

     "There could not be a more Christian act than that, for who could be 
more
Christian-like than to remember the waiter?" and William at once admitted 
the
truth of the assertion, and they both left the room, and instructions were
given to William to obtain the proper aid respecting the funeral, and an 
order
was given to the undertaker to come and measure the corpse for its last
garment.

     All these things were duly attended to, and kept secret, so that a very
few persons were aware of the fact that so strange an occurrence had taken
place in the good city of Winchester, much less were they acquainted with 
the
precise locality of the very house n which the occurrence took place.

     When the morning arrived on which the funeral was to take place, some
persons were surprised to behold a couple of mutes standing side by side at
the door of the Star hotel, and there had been no previous signs of 
mourning.

     The hearse and one mourning coach, however, was all that attended, into
which one solitary mourner entered.  There were several others made up for 
the
occasion, to give the cavalcade an uniform appearance.

     The body was carried down by eight men.  It was very heavy, and the men
bent beneath the load they bore, and when it was placed in the hearse, the 
one
mourner got in, and they proceeded towards the cathedral, which was quite
close at hand.

     A few -- very few minutes served to bring them to the goal, and before
the entrance of the cathedral they stopped, and out came the undertakers, 
who
contrived, with much exertion, to carry the body into the church; and then,
after some preliminary ceremonies, it was conducted into the vaults, where 
it
was deposited, and the burial service was said over it most duly and 
solemnly,
and then left, it was presumed, safe and secure, to abide its final doom at
the day of judgment.

     But many thoughts prove but the shadow of our wishes, and this seemed
but as a mocking shadow; as our readers are aware by this time of what
actually took place in the dead of the night.

     "In what name was the deceased registered-- the burial, I mean?" 
inquired
the clergyman, whose memory, like some of his other faculties, was obscured 
by
age.

     "His name was Francis Varney," replied the chief-mourner, who was no
other than the proprietor of the Star hotel.

 Next Time: A Rural Scene by Moonlight. -- The Storm. -- an Accident on the
 Road. -- A New and Strange Acquaintance Acquired. -- A Disappointment.




                            CHAPTER CXXXV. [sic]

                               [Chapter 145]

A RURAL SCENE BY MOONLIGHT. -- THE STORM. -- AN ACCIDENT ON THE ROAD. -- A 
NEW
AND STRANGE ACQUAINTANCE ACQUIRED. -- A DISAPPOINTMENT.


     It was one of those pleasant, moonlight evenings that are frequently
felt, as well as seen, towards the end of August, that a party of 
individuals
sat in a travelling-carriage, and were proceeding at an easy pace on one of
the cross-roads that run from Winchester to Bath, and also from Southampton,
the Isle of Wight, between Salisbury -- more properly speaking -- and Bath.

     The evening was lovely: the day had been sultry, and the sun had not 
been
gone down so long but that the heat of his rays yet remained.  Indeed, 
though
the moon gave light, yet the radiated heat from the earth, first received 
from
the sun, was so great, that the light evening breeze barely tempered the 
air.

     The party thus proceeding had been spending a few weeks in rambling 
about
Southampton, Portsmouth, and Salisbury, and were now wending their way to 
the
city of Bath.  They consisted of but four individuals, -- Captain Fraser, 
his
wife, her sister, and younger brother.  The latter did not count more than
tweleve years, while the sister, Miss Stevens, was just seventeen years of
age.

     Captain Fraser had scarce been married six months, and was upon one of
the early matrimonial jaunts which often take place in the earlier part of 
the
married life, when all is sunshine, and the matrimonial barometer might 
always
have the index nailed to "set fair" at such periods.

     The lady's sister and brother were residing with her; for their parents
were dead, and hence they, the captain and his lady, were their natural
protectors.

     They were riding in an open carriage, the head parted, and thrown back;
and even in this manner they felt the evening air was scarcely, though 
riding,
cool.

     "I don't think," said Mrs. Fraser to her husband, "that ever I beheld 
so
beautiful a scene.  The time -- the warmth of the air -- the occasional
delicious feel of the light evening breeze -- the serene light of the moon;
altogether, I never felt so comfortable, or, I may add, so happy as I do at
this moment."

     "I am glad to hear you say so," said the captain; ["]it gives me an
additional pleasure to find I can please you."

     "Now, Fraser, that is too bad of you."

     "What is too bad, my dear?" said the captain, inquiringly.

     "Why, to say you are glad you can please.  That is as bad as to say 
that
it is a very difficult matter; and you know I am very easily pleased,
especially when you make the attempt," said Mrs. Fraser.

     "Well, we will not quarrel about that, my dear.  But I must say, with
you, this hour, time, and place are all one could desire, and such as we
seldom meet: the scene across the country is truly beautiful!"

     "Yes," said Miss Stevens; "it is beautiful, as far as we can see."

     "What river is that yonder?" inquired the brother.

     "That is the Willey; the same that we saw at Salisbury," said Captain
Fraser.

     "Indeed!  I thought that came from another direction more northerly."

     "That was another arm of the same river, and joined this about there, 
and
all the low grounds on this side of yon hills are called the Valley of the
Willey; and a beautiful little vale it is, too, fruitful and picturesque."

     "How beautiful the moonbeams glisten on yonder water!"

     "They do; but not so strongly as they did."

     "No.  What is the reason of that?  The air appears to darken.  I have
noticed it for some minutes past.  Why is that?"

     "I suppose it is caused by the evaporation from the grounds and heavy
dews, to compensate for the want of rain that usually takes place at this 
time
of the year."

     "Then we shall be obliged to shut up the carriage, for the dew is more
likely to cause cold than anything else."

     "It is so; but we are upon comparatively high ground here; and, 
moreover,
they will not reach us yet; but, here are shawls; you can wrap up if you 
feel
chilly, or you can put on your veils."

     "It is yet so warm," said Miss Stevens, "that I should be reluctant to
put on any more clothing yet-awhile."

     "Do as you please, but do not take cold," said Captain Fraser.  "How
indistinct the scene becomes around; the river, which we just now saw so
plain, is quite obscured, and you can scarcely tell where it is, save here 
and
there, where the doddered willows appear, and which mark out the course of 
the
stream."

     "It is so," said the youth.  "I can just see the green tops of the 
trees
appear above the thick mist that rises from the river below."

     "Exactly; that is the fact."

     "And see how it spreads itself over the cornfields and meadows."

     "Was that not a flash of light?" said Mrs. Fraser, suddenly.

     "Light!  I saw no light," said the captain.

     "Nor I," said the youth; "did you, sister?"

     "No, I did not do so; but it is very sultry, and therefore it is very
likely just at this time of the year.  How much farther have we to travel
before we stop for the night?"

     "I suppose seven or eight miles, not more."

     "There, that was no mistake, however," said Mrs. Fraser, as a flash of
light shot across the heavens, and left not a trace behind it.

     "No, there was no mistake about it; nor did I think so before," said
Captain Fraser, "only I have not noticed it; but it is harmless-- it is what
is called summer lightning, and has none of the the ordinary results of
lightning."

     "It will possibly make the air cool," suggested Mrs. Fraser, "and, in
that case, we shall have a more agreeable temperature; to tell the truth, 
the
extreme warmth and dryness of the air gives a strange uneasiness to the 
body."

     "Another flash-- ah, that's a change in its character."

     "Yes; that is the blue-forked lightning, and I am much mistaken if we 
do
not have a sudden change-- hark!"

     At that moment, a sullen and deep rumbling was heard in the heavens,
followed by another flash, and then such a peal of thunder that boomed and
rattled through the air in a manner that startled the dull echoes of the
night, and made the welkin resound with the fearful sounds that filled the
heavens.

     "We shall have a fall of rain in another moment," said Captain Fraser;
"push on, drive on, and let us get out of this as soon as we can."

     "Aye, aye, sir," said the driver, and crack went his whip -- the horses
increased their speed, and they rattled on at a good pace.

     "Had we better not stop and have the hood closed.[?]"

     "No," said the captain; "I can manage that very well, with the 
assistance
of your brother, and we shall not lose time."

     Captain Fraser, and the young gentleman alluded to, brought the coach-
top
up and secured it, just as a heavy shower descended in such torrents that 
they
could scarcely hear themselves speak, so heavily did it rattle upon the
leathern covering of the vehicle, and they sat for some time in silence.

     Soon, however, the thunder and lightning filled the air with sounds and
flashes in a manner that began to create a feeling of alarm in the minds of
the ladies, and some uneasiness in the mind of the captain; not upon their
account only, but because the cattle might take flight under the
circumstances, especially as they were fresh, and had now scarcely run three
or four miles; for their stage was a long one before they reached their
destination, which was now about two days' easy journeys.

     The thunder and lightning appeared to become more and more terrible; 
the
storm, indeed, appeared to increase rather than diminish in intensity; the
very centre of the storm appeared to be fast approaching, and making the 
spot
upon which they stood the pivot on which it turned; its fury increased, and
with it the horses were each moment becoming more and more unmanageable.
Though in some measure aware of the fact, Captain Fraser kept his place,
fearful lest he should alarm his wife, and at the same time distract the
coachman.

     Suddenly there was a bright and vivid flash of light, such as they had
not seen before, but which illumined the whole place around them, and made
everything as visible as if placed in the strongest light imaginable, 
followed
by such a crashing peal of thunder that the living earth appeared to rock
again.

     It wanted but this to make the horses perfectly ungovernable, and they
dashed away at a furious speed along the road.

     "Good heavens! the horses have taken fright," said Mrs. Fraser, as she
became aware of the speed they were going at.

     "They have merely taken fright, my dear," said the captain, unwilling 
to
increase their alarm by informing them of his own; "he will keep them in the
middle of the road, and we shall be at our journey's end the sooner, and the
more so the better."

     They were upon the point of being satisfied, when the jolts of the
carriage, added to its eccentric course from one side of the road to the
other, attracted so much of their attention that Miss Stevens said, --

     "See, captain, how the carriage sways from side to side; we shall all 
be
over in another minute or two-- we shall all be killed!"

     "There goes the thunder again, worse than your kettle drums," said 
young
Stevens, who appeared to think it rather a joke; "the lightning flashes, 
too,
as if we had got into an electrical machine."

     "Do not talk in that way, Charles, for goodness sake," exclaimed his
younger sister.  "We shall all be killed presently."

     "I hope not," said Captain Fraser, "though I admit it looks serious; 
but
all you can do, and the best under all the circumstances, is to remain calm
and quiet, and see what happens."

     "See what happens!  Dear me, captain, what do you think we are all made
of that we should sit calm," said Miss Stevens, "and see what will happen,
when there may be broken limbs, at the least, if not death?"

     "It is the best advice I can give you."

     "Had we better not get out-- I don't mind trying?"

     "Aye, if you wish to run imminent risk of instant and violent death, 
you
will make the attempt; if you remain in here shut up, you have every
probability that, if we do have an upset, which is not yet certain, we may 
all
escape with but a little fright, or at most a few bruises."

     "Yes, sister; you had better wait for the worst, if the worst must
happen, rather than rush into it."

     This was sensible advice, and the whole party fell into a deep silence,
which was unbroken save by the sounds of wheels, the rattling of the 
carriage,
the rain, and the roar of thunder, enough to employ their minds, and at the
same time to keep them in momentary dread of the fearful catastrophe.

     Suddenly there was a crash and dreadful jolt; they knew not what had
happened, except they felt that the vehicle was turned over.

     In a moment more the door was opened, and a stranger lent assistance in
getting out the unfortunate travellers.

     "Do not be alarmed, ladies," said a strange, but courteous voice.  "No
further mischief can happen now, beyond inconvenience."

     As the stranger spoke, he lifted the two ladies out of the carriage, 
and
placed them in a sheltered position by the body.

     "Are you hurt?" inquired the stranger, as he assisted Captain Fraser 
and
young Stevens out of the fallen carriage.

     "No, sir, I am not; I thank you for your timely aid.  Where are the
ladies?"

     "There they are; I hope, uninjured."

     Captain Fraser immediately ran up to them, and, seeing them in safety,
said, --

     "I am glad to see you are safe.  I was stunned at first by a blow on 
the
side of my head."

     "Yes, we are safe; but we have to thank this gentleman that we have 
been
so speedily and so easily extricated from our unpleasant prison."

     "I am much indebted, sir, for your aid to the ladies.  May I trespass
upon your kindness to lend me a little further assistance?"

     "I shall be happy to assist you under these unpleasant circumstances;
but, allow me to suggest as the first thing, that the cushions be placed 
under
the hedge for the use of the ladies, and what cloaks or coats you have 
should
be thrown over them."

     "Right, sir; I thank you."

     "If you are deficient in them, my cloak is at their service, though I 
am
afraid that it is almost saturated."

     "I have enough here," said Captain Fraser, as he pulled out several
articles of that nature; and then he, with the assistance of the stranger,
placed them so that Mrs. Fraser and sister were almost, if not entirely,
sheltered from the storm.

     "Now," said the stranger, "the first thing that can be done will be to
right the carriage, and place it in a position where it will receive no
further damage."

     "But the driver and horses," said Captain Fraser, "I must look after
them.  Had we better not look after them?  He may be dying."

     "By no means," said the stranger; "he will do very well; if we place 
the
carriage upright, we shall be able to replace the ladies."

     "We can," said the captain, who appeared to be divided between the 
duties
of humanity and the tender anxiety he felt for his wife.

     "Exactly," said the stranger; "and permit me to suggest that he has
either gone on beyond our aid, or does not require it."

     "It is possible."

     "And very probable," said the stranger; "but if you prefer it, and 
think
the ladies will not suffer, we can walk on ahead till we come up with them, 
if
they stop before the end of the stage."

     "No, no, sir; you are quite right; I will get the carriage up if you 
can
so far assist me; we shall then place the ladies in comparative safety."

     "We shall so."

     They immediately walked round the carriage, and examined its position, 
as
well as they were able, when, to the captain's great relief, he found that 
it
was still on its wheels, though the body was thrown over on its side.

     "How can it have happened?" inquired the captain.

     "I cannot well see," replied the stranger; "but you will perceive
something must have caught the off-side wheel, and turned the whole of the
fore carriage that way, which has left this corner of the body without
support; added to which, the speed or momentum it must have acquired in its
course, has thown it over."

     "Precisely.  I see now how it is; but if we get the body up, it will 
fall
again over on this side, since it has no support."

     "Oh, yes, it will remain up, since it has lost all force, all moving
power; unless, indeed, any of the straps are broken.  We can try."

     "Here, Charles," said Captain Fraser, "we shall want your aid."

     "Oh," said the stranger, "the slightest assistance is valuable; it is 
the
last strain or effort that may complete the removal.  Now, if we can lift it
up from this side, we shall soon right it, and then the fore carriage can be
forced round, and the ladies replaced, until we can better dispose of them."

     The stranger placed his shoulder to the carriage, as well as the 
captain
and his brother-in-law, young Stevens, and thus aided, he soon lifted it up
into its old position, and there it remained very quietly.

     "Now we had better pull the wheels round."

     This was done, and the carriage assumed its former state.

     "Well, how could they have got away?" inquired Captain Fraser, 
examining
the axles and the bars; "all appears right."

     "They have broken the splinter-bar, and here are the remains of the
traces.  The splinter-bar, I find, has only lost its hooks, so it will do
again.  Come, sir, you have less damage to regret than I at first thought it
possible you could have escaped with; I am tuly glad it is so."

     "Thank you, sir; your kindness and assistance has been truly great and
efficient; but I have yet to find the poor fellow who drove us."

     "We will seek after him; or, I had better ride on to the next town or
house where I can obtain assistance, while you will be better able to 
protect
the ladies by remaining with them, and my horse will carry me quickly 
enough."

     "Oh! you are mounted."

     "I am; but the ladies wait."

     Thus admonished, the captain turned to the ladies, and, with the
stranger's assistance, he conducted them back to the carriage, where they 
were
replaced, without any material damage or misfortune of any kind, save what
might arise from fright.

     "Some one is coming this way," said the stranger.  "If I mistake not,
they are your runaways, by the sounds."

     They listened, and distinctly heard the sounds of horses' feet coming
along, with the jingling of harness, that made it pretty certain that what 
the
stranger said was correct, and that it was most probable that this was 
indeed
the man who drove them coming back with the same cattle, or some fresh.

     A few moments more decided the speculation, and the man himself rode 
up,
and looked at the carriage, saying, --

     "Well, I thought it was upset."

     "So it was, but we have righted it now.  Has no accident happened to 
you?
But these are the same horses!"

     "Yes, sir.  When they got loose, or broke away, they went as if they 
were
shot out of a gun, and away they went for some miles, until I contrived to
stop them, which was a hard job; however, I thought then, as there was 
nothing
the matter with them or with me, I had better return and see what was become
of you, sir, and the ladies."

     "Quite right.  Do you think they will go quietly in the harness again?"

     "Oh, yes-- oh, yes, sir."

     "Then we will harnes; [sic] them, and go on to the end of the next 
stage,
when we can see exactly what mischief, if any, has been done."

     This was immediately put in practice, and they were soon harnessed, the
broken straps and traces being mended in the best way time and circumstances
admitted, but effectually enough for the present purpose.

     "Now, sir," said Captain Fraser, "do you continue this road, or the one
we have come?  I supppose we must have overtaken you, as you were coming 
this
way."

     "No; I was a traveller going in the same direction.  I saw your speed
from a distance, and, believing your horses to have taken fright, I rode on,
and, being well mounted, I overtook you just as the accient happened."

     "Then we may have the pleasure of your company on the road for some
distance to come, I hope, sir?"

     "As far as the next place to stop at, at all events; for I do not 
desire
to travel further than I can avoid to-night."

     "Then I shall be able to thank you more at leisure, and at a better
opportunity than at present," said the captain.

     "Do not name it; I am too happy to have had it in my power to render 
you
any assistance.  Shall I ride on and secure you proper accomodation when you
do arrive there?"

     "You kindness is very great," said the captain again.  "I am much
beholden to you; but if we can get as far as we hoped to do, we shall not
require it; there will be sufficient for travellers under the ordinary 
course
of events.  We shall do very well; and if we should not be able to get so 
far,
we must make ourselves content with whatever chance accommodation we get on
the road."

     "Then we will journey for that distance in company," said the stranger,
as he mounted his horse, which had stood quietly by while the tall stranger
rendered the timely assistance he had to them.

     They proceeded along now at a cautious pace.  The weather had abated, 
and
the rain was now less severe; the thunder only heard in the distance; while
the lightning could only be seen in occasional flashes in the distance, in a
direction away from them.  The clouds began to lighten, and then the 
diffused
light of the moon came and shed a gentle light upon the scene, though it was
very scarce, and of comparative little use save it enabled them to see their
way all the better.

     The roads were good, and they travelled onwards with some increase of
speed; and finding none of their amended horse-tackle had given way, they
still kept journeying onwards at the same pace.

     Time brought them to their destination, and when they arrived at the 
inn
at which they were to stop for the night, they found it had not made much 
more
than an hour or an hour and a half's difference.

     When they were fairly housed, the stranger took an apartment to 
himself.
It was while he sat before the fire that Captain Fraser entered his room.

     "I must apologise for my intrusion," began the captain.

     "Do not say a word on that head, sir," said the stranger; "it is no
intrusion-- you are welcome.  Be seated, if you please; I am alone, and
perfectly at leisure."

     "I have come to thank you for the service you have done us, and to beg
that you will sup with us, and permit the ladies to have an opportunity of
thanking their preserver in person.  You will oblige us all by accepting the
invitation."

     "I am much obliged for your courteous offer," said the stranger, who 
was
a tall, dignified man.  "I will come after supper, if you please, and shall
feel it a great honour, I assure you; but I am so truly sensible that my
efforts were more owing to accident than to anything else, that I do not 
wish
to hear anything more of it."

     "You must not be so self-denying, sir.  We do not wish to put any more
merit on your act than we think it deserves; but that much you must accept, 
if
you will permit me to use such a word.  Shall we have the pleasure of your
company?"

     "After supper."

     "I will not press you against your feelings; but you will come in after
supper, sir?  I hope I may have the pleasure of drinking a bottle of wine 
with
you.  Will you come?"

     "I will, sir, and thank you for the honour."

     "May I have the pleasure of being able to introduce you to the ladies 
by
name?" said the captain, with a little hesitation.

     "Certainly-- certainly.  I beg your pardon.  I am somewhat forgetful; I
forgot I had not passed through an introduction," said the stranger.  
"Permit
me to give you my card."

     As he spoke, he handed Captain Fraser a beautifully-embossed card, upon
which was printed, in Italian characters, -- "Sir Francis Varney."

     Captain Fraser took the card and read the name, and then, passing a
compliment, he said, that since he could not have his company to supper, 
then
he should expect him when he felt at leisure and disposed to do so.

                       *              *              *

     "My dear," said Captain Fraser to his wife, when he returned to his
apartment, "our new friend will not come to supper but will take a glass of
wine with me afterwards."

     "I am sorry he will not come; though, under other cicumstances, I 
should
have been glad of it; but I am sorry on this occasion."

     "And why would you have been glad?"

     "Because, after the flurry and upset we had, I am hardly fit to see any
one, much less a stranger; but he so kindly and promptly rescued us from our
danger, that I cannot feel reluctance at any time."

     "Yes," said her sister; "and I must say I never heard a voice that
sounded so really like a gentleman's-- indeed, I could fancy that any one
could positively assert that he was a gentleman, only from hearing him 
speak,
without seeing him at all; but, be that as it may, I felt convinced he was
such."

     "He is very courteous, I must say," said Mrs. Fraser.

     "And who do you think he is?"

     "I have no means of forming any judgment."

     "Well, then, he is Sir Francis Varney."

     "Sir Francis Varney!  Well, I do not know the name; I never heard the
name before that time; but I think there was some one of that name in the 
time
of Queen Elizabeth-- an attendant on the Earl of Leicester."

     "Are you not joking?"

     "Indeed I am not; I have read so.["]

     "And you think this gentleman may be a descendant of his?"

     "There is no impossibility nor improbability about it, that I see," 
said
Mrs. Fraser; "but I am the more obliged to him for his timely assistance.  I
am sure it was fortunate that he was so close at hand."

     "Yes, it was very fortunate.  Mary, my dear, we shall be introduced to 
a
baronet.  It is quite a prophecy of yours in saying he was a gentleman when
you only heard him speak.  By the way, Fraser, what sort of a man is he?"

     "Very singular indeed."

     "Singular!  Ay-- he is very tall."

     "Yes, he is tall; but very pale; more remarkable and dignified than
handsome; extremely courteous and polite."

     "What age is he?"

     "Well, I cannot tell; perhaps forty, perhaps not so old by ten years; 
it
is quite impossible to say."

     "Dear me, how strange!  I think I could guess anybody's age better than
that."

     "You shall have an opportunity of doing so, then, in an hour or so, 
when
he will come; and I think I may venture upon saying you will be pleased with
his dignified politeness, and say he is much superior to most men."

             *               *               *               *

     The supper ended, and the wine was produced, and Captain Fraser, his
lady, and two young relatives, were seated round a good fire -- for the 
storm
had chilled the air; besides, the damp they had stood in rendered such a
precaution necessary and pleasant, notwithstanding the day had been sultry;
but the change in the temperature was sudden and great -- awaiting, with
something like impatience, the stranger's arrival.

     "He does not appear to come," said Charles Stevens.

     "He is not here, certainly; but he will come, no doubt, the moment he 
is
quite sure that we had done our supper, and he had finished his own; perhaps
he takes longer than we."

     "Perhaps so; but I am strongly tempted to go to him again."

     "It might be construed into undue urgency, or something of the sort,"
said Mrs. Fraser; "and yet he might be waiting for something of the sort."

     "So he might," said the captain.  "At all events, I will go and see; if
he were inclined to do so under other circumstances, he would not take 
offence
under the present."

     "Perhaps not."

     At that moment the door was opened, and the waiter presented a note.

     "A note for me?" said Captain Fraser.

     "Yes, sir."

     "Who can it be from?"

     "From the gentleman up stairs, sir, who came with you an hour back."

     "Oh!" exclaimed Captain Fraser.

     "He was taken ill, and obliged to go to bed, sir."

     Captain Fraser immediately tore open the note, and read as follows: --

     "SIR, -- I deeply regret I cannot keep my promise to take a glass of 
wine
with you, and have the honour of being introduced to the ladies.  Favour me 
so
far as to make my excuses to them.  It is a great pleasure lost to me on the
occasion; permit me to to say deferred, rather than lost; and if I might
venture to make an appointment, under the circumstances, I can only say 
that,
if convenient, I should be happy to breakfast with you, and then have the
honour and happiness I have now the misfortune to lose.

     "Sudden and severe indisposition alone have caused me to retire before 
I
had the honour of seeing you, and expressing my inability to attend you. --
Yours, obliged,

                              "FRANCIS VARNEY."

     There was a blank upon the countenances of all present.  Evidently a 
deep
disappointment was felt by all; but the captain was especially surprised, 
and,
turning to the waiter, he said, --

     "Did you see this gentleman?"

     "Yes, sir."

     "Was he unwell?"

     "Yes, sir."

     "I mean, was he, or is he, dangerously ill?"

     "He was very ill, sir; but I don't know that he is dangerously ill.  He
suffered much pain, and he was obliged to have aid to go up stairs."

     "Did he say what it was that ailed him?" pursued Captain Fraser.

     "Not that I heard; though some said he had got the cramp and cold by
being too long in the wet."

     "Perhaps so-- very likely-- very likely-- that will do.  Let me know 
how
he is the first thing in the morning; do you hear?"

     "Yes, sir, I will take care."

     "Well," said Mrs. Fraser, when they were alone, "I did not expect such 
a
disappointment this evening.  However, he makes up for it by appointing the
breakfast hour for our meeting; it is the more agreeable, as we shall have 
had
a good night's repose, and shall be the better able to appear to advantage."

 A Morning Succeeding to a Night of Adventure.




                            CHAPTER CXXXVI. [sic]

                               [Chapter 146]

THE ALARM AT THE INN. -- BED-CHAMBER TERRORS. -- A NIGHT SCENE. --  A 
MORNING
SUCCEEDING TO A NIGHT OF ADVENTURE.


     The inmates of the inn are all fast bound in sleep.  The senses of all
seem steeped in deep forgetfulness; even the hour of dreams was passed.  The
storm, which had raged so violently in the early part of the evening, and
which had appeared to have gone and a calm succeeded, had returned, and the
fury of the blast was only equalled by the deluging rain and the fearful
rumbling of the thunder.

     But calmly slept the beautiful and innocent Mary Stevens.  She was
young, and her mind bore no weight of care; when she slept no dreams 
disturbed
her rest, but a calm, death-like sleep sat upon her soul, and steeped it in
forgetfulness.

     The storm raged around, but she heard it not; she was unconscious of 
it.
Perhaps the disturbance and fatigues of the previous day caused a greater
degree of depth to her insensibility, and rendered her mind less liable to
slight interruptions.  But she slept soundly, and even did not hear the
intruder who walked across the floor of her bedroom, and stood gazing on her
fair arms as she lay sleeping.

     The intruder was a tall man, enveloped in some strange mantle, all 
white.
He stooped over her, as if he listened to the beating of her heart, while 
his
strangely bright eyes, which shone fearfully, appeared to express a horrible
kind of joy, too terrible for human nature to contemplate.

     He stooped-- he placed his hand upon her heart, and felt its 
pulsations,
and a terrible and ghastly smile passed over his features, while a movement 
of
the lips and mouth generally, appeared as if anticipatory of a coming meal.

     Then he took the white arm in his hands, and cast a longing look at the
features of the maiden, who appeared disturbed by the rude action, and moved
in her sleep, and was suddenly aroused from her slumber by a severe pang in
her arm, as though some creature had plunged its fangs into her flesh.

     She started up, and found herelf [sic] flung upon the bed with gigantic
strength.  She screamed, and uttered scream upon scream.

     The old inn was filled with sounds of terror and pain.  There was a 
loud
knocking heard at the door.  Then, indeed, the assailant left his prey to
provide for his own safety; but it was almost too late, for the door was 
burst
open violently, as he made for another means of exit, which was the means by
which he had entered the apartment; but he was prevented, and, as the first
person entered the apartment, he threw him down by placing something in his
way.  The light was thrown against some furniture, which immediately rose up
into a flame.

     "Help! help!  Fire! fire!"

     These were fearful sounds, such as had never before been heard in that
place, and the inmates, woke up by the screams from deep slumber, were
startled and terrified at these sounds, and springing at once from their 
beds,
echoed the sounds as they run wildly about from place to place.

     "Where is the fire?  What's the matter?"

     "Fire in the young lady's room."

     All eyes were directed to that quarter, and in another instant there 
were
several persons rushing to the room, the glare of the fire in which at once
attracted their observation, and they rushed to the rescue; among the 
foremost
of whom was Sir Francis Varney, whose bedchamber was not far distant from 
Mary
Steven's.  He rushed to the bed, and wrapping the bedclothes round her, he
carried her out of the room and the scene of danger, and, as he came out of
the room, he inquired, --

     "Where is Captain Fraser?"

     "Here-- here I am, Sir Francis," said the captain, coming hastily
forward.

     "Then, Captain, Fraser, I resign my charge up to you-- you are her 
proper
protector; but I must apologize for my hasty intrusion into her apartment."

     "Do not think of speaking in that manner, Sir Francis; we are already
indebted to you for our lives, and now we are again your debtor.  Your ready
aid has twice saved the young lady."

     Captain Fraser took Miss Stevens form Sir Francis, and then carried 
her,
as she was quite insensible, to his own room to his wife, her sister, where
she was laid upon the bed, and found to be quite insensible.

     There was much confusion in the inn -- people were running about from
place to place, and tumbling over each other in the confusion of thought; 
and
the moments were precious, for many were running about, yet none did 
effective
service, though all were willing enough to do all that could be done by them
under the circumstances.

     "You had better get some water," said Varney, "as quickly as you can.  
It
is useless to run about and stare at each other.  Get all the buckets you 
can.
Be quick about it.  There may yet be time enough to save the inn, and keep 
the
fire to the room where it is; but that time will soon be at an end."

     Instantly two or three of the men ran down and got a plentiful supply 
of
water, and then, under the direction of Sir Francis Varney, the fire was 
very
soon got under, and the flames were extinguished.

     Then came an inquiry how the fire had first appeared.

     "Do you know how it happened?" inquired Sir Francis Varney, of the
innkeeper, who stood quite mute with astonishment at the scene before him.

     "Know, sir!" said the the innkeeper.  "I don't know anything.  I don't
know myself.  I don't even know where I am, or what's the matter."

     "Then I beg to tell you, sir," said Varney, with much sauvity of 
manner,
"then I beg to tell you, sir, that there has been a fire in your inn-- a 
young
lady frightened out of her senses, and I know not the cause."

     "No more don't I," said the landlord, with a short grunt, indicative of
wonderment and alarm.  "I wish I did.  I wonder who set the place a-fire;
that's what I wants to know, and why he did it."

     "The motive was not a bad one, I believe."

     "Not a bad motive, that which causes one man to set fire to and destroy
another man's property!"

     "Not when it is not only not done with any evil intention, but it was 
not
even done wilfully," said Sir Francis.

     "Perhaps you saw it done," said the landlord, with another grunt.

     "I did," replied Varney; "hearing the disturbance, I hastily threw on
some of my clothes, and ran out of my apartment to ascertain what was the
matter, and found several others had got here before me, and had burst open
the door.  The first who entered, had a light in his hand, and fell with it,
setting the place on fire, which burned furiously for a minute or more, the
hangings being dry and old.  I took the young lady out, else I am sure she
must have perished."

     "Well, I saw you come out with her in your arms, like a salamander; but
what I most want to know is, what was it that disturbed my customer?  That 
is
of the greatest consequence to me."

     "You are perfectly right, my friend," said Sir Francis, with much
composure, "to make that inquiry, that being the origin of all that
subsequently took place.  You are a man of discernment, and must see that 
the
young lady herself can alone give us any account of that."

     "True, sir; but I am much obliged to you for the trouble you have 
taken,
not only for the young lady's sake, but for the property you have prevented
being destroyed.  You have, no doubt, saved the inn, and all it contains."

     "That is enough, sir," said Varney, waving his hand, "you have said
enough.  I am glad I have rendered you a service, and that it has been
effectual."

     "It has been just the thing," said the landlord.

     "Then take my advice.  See the place is secure, and send all persons to
bed, save, perhaps, a single individual, who might be set to watch the room
which has been on fire, and which may have some slumbering spark in it, 
though
I think not; but the quieter the place is, the sooner the young lady's alarm
will be over, and then all will be well."

     "Certainly, certainly," said the landlord, "it will be better to do so;
but here is the only gentleman who can tell us how the young lady is."

     Sir Francis Varney turned round, and beheld Captain Fraser coming 
towards
them with a very grave aspect.

     "Captain Fraser," said Sir Francis, "perhaps you can tell us what we 
are
so very anxious to learn, and what we have been inquiring about."

     "What may that be, Sir Francis?"

     "We have been trying to learn what it is that caused the young lady to
scream out in such a fearful manner.  We have settled the cause of the fire-
-
that has been manifest enough to us all."

     "Indeed!  I am not acquainted with it."

     "It arose from the first person who entered her apartment after the 
door
was burst open, falling over something, and setting fire to the curtains,
which blazed up in an instant, and set the whole room on fire."

     "Indeed!" said Captain Fraser, almost incredulously.

     "Yes, I saw that myself," said Varney, "and I stepped over him as he 
lay
on the ground, and therefore know it; but how is the young lady?  Has she
recovered from the extreme fright into which she has been thrown?"

     "It is a much more serious affair than I had any notion of, Sir 
Francis."

     "I am concerned to hear you say so."

     "Shall I send for the doctor?" inquired the landlord.

     "Do-- that is what I came to ask you to do; she has recovered once, and
has fainted again.  I know not what to think.  She has a singular wound in 
her
arm.  I can't understand that, at all events."

     "I did not see it when I took hold of her; though, to be sure, what I
did, was done in smoke and flame, and I could not be supposed to scrutinize
very closely, had I been so inclined; but what kind of wound is it?"

     "I can hardly describe it to you, save it is a bite; and there are
teeth-marks plain enough to be seen; though we have no means of telling what
kind of creature it was that inflicted the wounds."

     "Indeed!  I am concerned, for the effect upon the imagination will be
very bad; but did she not see, or fancy she saw the object that injured 
her?"

     "It was dark, and the storm raged without; moreover, she was held down 
by
a powerful grasp; and when she attempted to rise, she was flung down, and 
she
could feel the blunted teeth enter her flesh, and the creature appeared to
suck her blood."

     "Dear me," said Sir Francis, "what a very strange affair!  It is
fortunate I was obliged to retire early, and I slept the lighter, and was
therefore easily aroused from my sleep; but I am proverbially a light
sleeper."

     "Are you, sir?  But what has caused the wound in her arm I cannot tell;
it is quite a mystery.  She has got a fancy into her mind that it was a 
human
being; but that could not have been the fact."

     "I should imagine not," said Sir Francis.

     "And then, I know of no animal who could commit such an act: a cat or a
dog could not have done it, though a dog might have made the teeth-marks; 
but
a dog would hardly have attempted to suck blood."

     "They will do it," said Sir Francis, "that I know to be a fact; and I
believe it to be one that is generally admitted by all persons, especially
that breed of animials mostly kept, and which have something of the bull-dog
in them."

     "It may be so; but how could she be held down by one of them?  She 
could
not be struck down when she attempted to rise."

     "It is not for me to combat the young lady's opinions; but, remember, 
my
dear sir, how terrified, not to say how horrified, she must have been at 
such
an unusual, and, I may add, unheard-of an attack; if you consider such 
things,
and the improbability-- not to say what appears to me, the impossibility-- 
you
will see plenty of room for mistakes to arise, and give her notions a wrong
turn."

     "That is very true."

     "And besides, I would, if I were convinced of the contrary, endeavour 
to
persuade her of her mistake, unless you can discover the perpetrator of the
outrage, when justice demands that such a savage should be severely 
punished."

     "By G-d! Sir Francis," said the captain, "if I could see him, I would
shoot the scoundrel!  But, then, I am getting angry without a cause; it may
not be what she thinks, and then, you know, all one's anger goes for 
nothing."

     "So it does; but, in the meantime, great care and attention is 
requisite
to regain her confidence and serenity of mind."

     "Oh, a day or two will make a great difference in these matters, when 
we
come to change the scene."

     "Are you travelling far, Captain Fraser?"

     "As far as Bath," said the captain.

     At this moment the landlord returned, saying to Captain Fraser, --

     "I have sent to Mr. Carter, who will be here, no doubt; he is close at
hand, and will come in a moment.  He's a very clever gentleman, is Mr. 
Carter.
I saw him perform four operations on coach accidents."

     "Operations on coach accidents!" said Sir Francis Varney; "a curious
matter, that.  How did they succeed upon such materials?"

     "Oh, they were two broken arms, and three broken legs."

     "Indeed!  Did they all recover?"

     "No; only one got over it."

     "Upon my word, a promising member of the faculty to entrust so tender a
charge to, under such delicate circumstances.  But, landlord, have you any 
bad
characters about your house, or in the neighbourhood?"

     "I can't say anything about the neighbourhood, though I believe it is 
as
quiet and orderly as can be, or usually is.  I never hear anything against 
it,
and know nothing against it; and as for them in the house, I can answer they
would not hurt a fly, unless provoked to do so; but what I mean is, they are
all honest and tried servants."

     "Well, that is saying a good deal," said Captain Fraser; "but, have you
any dogs about the house-- I mean, any large dogs?"

     "Ah! dogs!  Yes, I have several dogs, and good dogs they are, too."

     "Could any of them get into the rooms-- the sleeping-rooms?  I mean,
could any of them get into the room that has taken fire?"

     "No, unless the door was opened," said the landlord.  "They are not
allowed to run about loose here, lest any one should get up in the night and
be mistaken for intruders; for my dogs, gentlemen, would take any one they 
saw
moving about outside of a night; but, otherwise, they are quiet,
well-conducted dogs."

     "Well, you mean to say they could not have got into Miss Stevens's 
room."

     "I do; I am sure of it.  They could not, because there were none of 
them
about the house when we went to bed-- when the house was shut up at night.
However, here is the doctor."

     The medical man now arrived, and was forthwith introduced to Captain
Fraser, who conducted him to the apartment in which Mrs. Fraser and Miss
Stevens were awaiting the coming of the doctor.  Captain Fraser, after 
having
introduced him to the invalid, returned to the landlord and Sir Francis.

     "Well, I cannot make it out at all," said Sir Francis.  "There must be
some mystery in it, I am persuaded; and if that could only be discovered, 
the
matter would lose half its terrors to the mind of the young lady."

     "No doubt it would do so," said the captain.  "The fire and her wound
together, have made a deep impression upon her."

     "The wound!" said the landlord.  "Is the young lady hurt, then?"

     "Hurt, indeed! she is seriously hurt.  She has received a severe wound 
in
the arm, by some one, or some dog having seized and bitten her seriously."

     "God bless me!" said the landlord; "I never heard of such a thing.
Somebody began to eat her, I suppose.  Upon my word, it would almost make 
one
believe we are in the Cannibal Islands, to say the least of it."

     "Here is the surgeon," said Sir Francis, who noticed that gentleman's
approach.

     "Well, sir," said Captain Fraser, "how is your patient?"

     "I fear she is much terrified; and if she were to remain here long, I
should hardly like to answer for her health.  She has received a very severe
shock."

     "Her wound-- what think you of that, sir?"

     "I really can't say anything about it, save that is is a bite; but how
inflicted I cannot say.  It is very mysterious, indeed; very strange!  But,
what I look upon as most important in the affair, is the impression it has
produced upon her mind; that, you see, may last her all her life, and 
produce
very unfortunate consequences.  I do not know that it will be so, but I 
state
what there is a possibility of-- or, I may, more correctly speaking, add, --
of what there is a great probability."

     "I regret to hear you say so," said Sir Francis Varney.  "Do you really
imagine the young lady has been bitten by any animal?"

     "Yes, I do; there are evidences enough to prove that.  There is the 
wound
in her arm, and the marks of the teeth quite plain; and she suffers from the
anguish of it much; but I shall be better able to say more about it early in
the morning, when I call again to see her."

     "She will be able to travel, I hope?"

     "Oh, yes, she will be able to do that; indeed, I would recommend she
should try to do so, as the best means of throwing off all the unpleasant
feelings and thoughts upon the occasion."

     "Will you call early to-morrow?"

     "I will," said the doctor; and then he bade them good evening, and 
left.

     "Well," said the landlord, "I'm amazed at what the doctor says about 
the
young lady.  I'm sorry it should have happened in my house; but I hope
something will turn up to make it turn out different."

     "That I'm afraid is not possible, seeing you have a clear demonstration
of what it is now; the mischief has been done."

     "I am the more sorry," said the landlord, "that it is likely to prey 
upon
the young lady's feelings, which are to be considered in the case."

     "Certainly, certainly; there is where the mischief is likely to spring
from."

     "However, it is of no use to stand here all night-- it is cold.  I must
get an hour or two's sleep before I get to business in the morning."

     "I think so too," said Captain Fraser; "well, I will bid you good 
night,
Sir Francis, and shall expect you in the morning to breakfast."

     "With pleasure," replied Varney; and they all parted, each going to his
own dormitory, to sleep or to think over the events of the night, as best 
they
might.

                               [Chapter 147]


     The next morning came, and with it came also the usual bustle of a
country inn, when strangers are stopping there, especially carriage 
strangers;
as well as the usual coach stoppages, when they change horses, which they 
did
more than once that morning.  It was at a later hour than usual when the 
party
breakfasted, and it was somewhat late when Sir Francis Varney entered the
room.

     "Good morning," said Sir Francis, with great suavity of manner, and in 
a
most courtly tone; "I trust I see you somewhat recovered from the fright you
were put to last night."

     "Oh, Sir Francis," said Mrs. Fraser; "it was a dreadful fright, indeed;
but we have so much to thank you for.  To you we owe much, and my sister 
owes
to you a double obligation-- you have rescued her twice."

     "I am happy to think I have been a fortunte instrument in serving you.  
I
trust Miss Stevens is better than she was."

     "I think she is better, Sir Francis; but she desires to remain in her
apartment until we are ready to start.  Though I thought it somewhat
unreasonable, because, if she is to travel, she had better have come out."

     "But her rest was disturbed by the accident, and it might have been 
early
before she slept; and an hour's rest and repose might do much towards
recovering her," said Sir Francis; "her own feelings are a good guide under
those circumstances."

     "I think so, too," said Captain Fraser.

     "I," said young Stevens, "was awoke by a desperate riot caused by 
people
running about; I did not hear anything of the scream."

     "I was awoke by it," said Captain Fraser.  "How did you hear of it-- 
how
were you awoke?"

     "By a loud scream," said Sir Francis; "I was asleep, and when it awoke
me, I knew not what it was.  I remained for a moment or two in doubt as to
whether I had not dreamt, but a repetition assured me that I was not
dreaming-- and knowing from the sound it was a female's voice, I jumped up,
and dressed myself as well as I could; but, before I could do that, I heard
people running about, and when I got into the gallery, I heard the door 
burst
in."

     "Did any one come out?"

     "I cannot say-- I saw no one; but the man who first entered the 
apartment
fell down, from some cause or other, and set the bed-curtains on fire--
accidentally, of course, but it was the same in effect."

     "Did you see any one in the room, Sir Francis?"

     "No one at all; I did not even know who slept there; but seeing the 
form
of a human being lying there, and wrapping the bed-clothes, or rather 
seizing
her and the bed-clothes, by grasping with both arms, I carried her out.  I
used but little ceremony, and the urgency of the case must be my excuse."

     "And it is, Sir Frnacis, though I know not in what way we can manifest
our feelings of gratitude to you."

     "You may, madam, by saying no more about it; but I shall be delighted 
to
think you have such a good opinion of my services; and the knowledge that 
they
have been useful, that is a gratification to me."

     "And one you are well entitled to, Sir Francis," said Captain Fraser.

     "How far are you travelling?" inquired Mrs. Fraser.

     "As far as Bath, madam, for the benefit of my health."

     "We are going to Bath, Sir Francis, as well.  I am sure it will be a
great pleasure to Captain Fraser, to find that we are to have such a
travelling companion-- that is, if you can accommodate yourself to 
travelling
in a carriage."

     "I can travel as you please.  I am mounted, and am used to such
travelling, for months at a time."

     "Do you travel much at a time, Sir Francis?"

     "Yes, I have been a great traveller, for years; not so much as regards
distance as to the constancy of my perambulations; for I continue for months
together out, riding from one town to another."

     "Without an attendant?"

     "Always; I never carry a servant about with me; it cannot be done with
comfort by any one.  You have always proper attendance if you stop at a
respectable inn, or hotel; or, if not, if the road you have to travel be a
cross route, you cannot expect any additional comfort from a servant, but 
you
are troubled at his not being comfortably lodged; at least, I am, for I have
tried it."

     "I dare say there is much wisdom in that.  I know from experience that 
a
single traveller, who has leisure, and is willing, may enjoy himself better
than he could if he were attended by his servant.  You are somewhat 
restrained
in your motions, and cannot do as you would please under all circumstances."

     "I am fully persuaded of that, from experience; but I shall travel on
horseback till I get to Bath, and then I hardly know whether I shall reamin 
at
an hotel, or take lodgings for the season-- or what."

     "What we intend is, to take lodgings," said Captain Fraser, "for a 
time--
as long as we feel inclined-- and then to enjoy ourselves."

     "Quite right," said Sir Francis; "quite right.  I am glad to hear you 
say
so, and I hope it may be of advantage to Miss Stevens."

     "I hope so too.  Shall we have the advantage of your company _en 
route?_"

     "I shall have great pleasure in having your company so far.  It will 
give
me great gratification, indeed; I shall be most happy to bear your company 
as
far as the city of Bath, and shall consider myself the gainer by your
society."

     "No, we shall be the only party that will benefit by it; but we shall
feel greatly your kindness, and I, for one, anticipate much pleasure on the
road from your society, and also when we arrive in Bath."

     "I feel such will be the case."

     At this moment Mr. Carter was announced also.  In a few momemts more 
this
individual was introduced to them; he was a plain gentlemanly man, who 
really
was a clever man, notwithstanding the fearful account of his prowess and 
skill
which the landlord had descanted on the previous night.

     "Well, Mr. Carter," said Captain Fraser, "how do you find my sister-- 
do
you think she is any better than she was?"

     "I think she is calmer, and much of the first violence of terror is 
gone;
but I cannot say any more-- she is still much disturbed."

     "Do you think there is anything dangerous in her state?"

     "No, sir, I do not; though I cannot hide from you the possibility that
there is of her being permanently affected by it-- I mean mentally; it may
take a deep hold of her, and there will be no getting her free from it, save
by judicious treatment."

     "You do not consider much, then, of her wound?"

     "The arm?  Oh, yes; that looks very angry, and has been a very severe
bite, and has caused her arm to swell; though I have no doubt about its
getting well, still it will be very painful for some days; and, had it been 
a
little more severe, it is possible that some of the tendons might have been
injured, or an artery wounded."

     "Upon my word," said Sir Francis Varney, "this had very nigh turned out 
a
very bad and serious affair, if not a dangerous one."

     "Of that there can be no doubt," said the doctor.

     "Well, but, after all, what was it that has caused all this 
disturbance?
What was it, a man or brute?"

     "Decidedly the latter, " said Sir Francis Varney, "decidedly the 
latter,
be the form of the creature what it may."

     "Indeed, you are right, Sir Francis," said Mrs. Fraser; "but she 
insists
it was a human being who made this abominable attack upon her-- why or
wherefore, no one knows; but she insists it was a man."

     "What do you say," doctor?"

     "I only know, sir, what the young lady says."

     "Do you think it probable?"

     "I cannot say I do.  I think it most unlikely; though, to be sure, 
there
is nothing in it that is impossible.  Had any one felt maliciously towards 
the
young lady, they might have perpetrated the crime; but, in the absence of 
all
malice, I cannot think so bad of human nature as to believe it."

     "You discredit it, then?" said Sir Francis Varney.

     "I do," said the doctor, "with all due respect to the young lady; but 
the
probability of mistake is so great, and when you consider the terror so
natural to the occasion, her powers of observation were limited and liable 
to
error, that I cannot myself believe otherwise than there is a great 
mistake."

     "And what do you consider of the wounds?  I mean, do you think it
possible they were inflicted by human teeth?  Are they of that shape and
character that could be inflicted by human teeth?"

     "Yes, decidedly; that is, so far as I am able to judge, while the wound
is swelled and angry, I should consider them just such as might be inflicted
by the teeth of a man or woman."

     "That corroborates the young lady's own belief."

     "It does, so far," said Mr. Carter.

     "Then comes the question of how could it have been done, and by whom?"

     "These seem to be questions which cannot be answered.  I asked the
landlord all that could tend to elicit that information, but with no 
success;
he knew nothing that could throw any light upon the subject."

     "Perhaps he knew nothing," suggested Mrs. Fraser.

     "Most probably he did not," was the reply.

     "I know the landlord to be a respectable, though somewhat eccentric 
man;
and I think him quite incapable of being a party to such an outrage upon any
person, much less upon a lady who was stopping at his house."

     "Well; however true that may be, yet it is undeniable that this outrage
has been commited, though by whom we cannot say, for we do not even suspect
anybody.  I can't understand it at all."

     "Nor I; but, as you observed, sir, the outrage has been committed, and
here, too; but, unfortunately, no one is suspected, and justice cannot be
done, which, in such a case, ought to be fully and clearly made out, for 
there
can be no palliation."

     "None at all."

     "I wish," said Captain Fraser, "I had been first in the room."

     "Why, sir," inquired Sir Francis Varney, "do you wish that?"

     "Because you see, sir, I should have felt that inward satisfaction
arising from the fact, that I fancy I might have ascertained whether any one
was, or had been, in the room."

     "The young lady said there was," said Sir Francis.

     "Yes-- yes; but then you saw the door opened, and saw no one come out."

     "I did not, though, after I had Miss Stevens in my arms, I came away, 
and
then it was possible any one might have got out, though there were others 
who
would have seen them; but still, in the bustle and confusion of the moment,
there might have been somebody."

     "Yes, there is that possibility," said Captain Fraser; "and I don't see
why I should trouble myself about this affair-- I mean, by wishing myself
there; but I should have done nothing but carry out the body-- that would 
have
been my first act."

     "No doubt," said Sir Francis; "and what made such an act the more
necessary is, the fact that she was in instant danger of death from burning,
or suffocation."

     "True-- true; who would have coolly gazed around him, when there, on 
the
bed, lay the unfortunate victim of God knows what."

     "Well, sir, I must bid you good day.  I have some patients to visit."

     "Not before we square accounts, which is easily done.  Let me know how 
we
may stand, sir, and I will pay you at once."

     This little affair was soon settled; and the doctor was about to 
depart,
when he said, before he left the room, --

     "I have given the young lady directions what to do relative to her arm.
She must not use it much; but any medical man who may chance to see it, will
be able to prescribe for it; though what I have given I deem almost enough 
to
effect her complete restoration, as far as regards the arm.  The shock, the
mind and nervous system have sustained, will only be eradicated by time and
change."

     "Thank you for your advice; that shall be attended to."

     The doctor now quitted the hotel; and the landlord entered the 
apartment
with a very serious aspect; and, after making his bow, proceeded to say, --

     "I am very sorry, sir, for the occurrence of last night-- very sorry,
indeed.  Indeed, sir, I cannot make it out at all.  I have inquired all over
the house, and nobody at all knows anything about it, nor can't think how it
could be.  A good many of them won't believe it at all, though I told them
there could be no doubt of it, for the young lady was burnt, and the bed set
on fire."

     "You may be sure of that, landlord; the young lady has been bitten on 
the
arm most severely."

     "And, as for the fire," said Sir Francis, "I saw how that occurred."

     "So you said, sir," replied the landlord; "if that fellow as fell down
had stood up, why, it wouldn't have set the curtains a fire."

     "No, that is true."

     "Well, then, he would have been able to have seen what was the matter,
instead of his filling the room full of smoke and fire as he did; he hadn't 
no
excuse to tumble down-- nobody knocked him down."

     "But didn't he hurt himself very badly?"

     "Oh, only about two or three square inches, or perhaps a patch as big 
as
your hand, off his chin-- that's nothing to such as he."

     "Very good.  But have you examined the place, to see if anybody could
have got in and concealed himself?  Was there any possibility of a man's
getting into your house, and secreting himself in any part of the bed-room,
which would thus afford him an opportunity of doing what has been done?"

     "Why, sir, I don't think it likely; and yet these people are so 
cunning,
that you could not, by any possibility, guard against them in any way,
especially in an inn.  But there is no house free from intrusion of that
character; but in this instance they could have had no notion the young lady
was to sleep there."

     "That is very true," said Captain Fraser, "and tends to show she was 
not
singled out for outrage; but what seems very singular, is, that any one 
should
secret themselves, and that with a view to commit such an outrage."

     "That is very true," said the landlord; "but people do very strange
things sometimes, and I think the object of any one hiding himself in the
house in such a manner as this rascal must have done, was robbery."

     "But he met with no resistance, and there could have been no excuse for
so cowardly an assault as this complained of."

     "There is much truth in that, and yet we don't know what human nature 
is
capable of," said the landlord.  "I have known a few things in my time; but
the man, or whatever he might be, might have been tempted to make the 
assault
complained of."

     "What?  Then, landlord, you imagine that a thief who had got into the
house, would make an attempt to eat a young lady?"

     "Why, as to eating her, sir," said the landlord, scratching his head, 
"I
cannot say that he would.  I don't know what his intentions might be, nor do 
I
profess to understand it all.  I can't, however, see what can be the motive,
save malice and spite; they mightn't care whom they injured, so long as
somebody was hurt."

     "They must have been very bad."

     "Yes, sir; and I wish I had seen them; if I had, I would no more mind
chopping them in two than I would cleave a marrow-bone.  I truly hope, sir,
you won't consider that, however unfortunate the circumstances are, that I 
am
blameable in this affair.  I took all the usual precautions in this affair--
that is, my house was secured as usual, and the place watched during the 
day;
for we are particular in that respect, knowing that we are very liable to be
robbed."

     "Exactly," said Captain Fraser; "and though I much regret the 
occurrence,
yet, I tell you, I do not see anything in which I say you are to blame.  It
is simply a great misfortune, and there ends the matter."

     "Thank you.  I regret it as much, I am sure, as anybody, because I am
very likely to be injured by it."

     "You are not to blame.  Allow my carriage to be at the door in half an
hour, as we shall leave almost immediately."

     "And my horse, too, landlord, as I bear this gentleman company."

     The landlord departed, and went towards the stables, and gave the
necessary orders; while the guests remained conversing on the extraordinary
occurrence that had taken place, and much pleased with the courtesy of their
new friend.

     Many were the speculations that were indulged in respecting the attack
upon Miss Stevens; many of them wild, but all wide of the mark, fortunately,
for her frame of mind; and then, before they had at all come to any
conclusion, or any satisfactory probability, the carriage was announced.

     "Well, Sir Francis, I presume you will ride with us?"

     "Yes, on horseback."

     "I understand so; we shall be much indebted to you for your goodness; 
but
here is Miss Stevens."

     At that moment the young lady entered the room, ready attired for
travelling, but looking very pale and timid.  Sir Francis advanced, and,
taking her hand, said, --

     "May I have the pleasure of hearing you say the occurrence of last 
night
has done you only a temporary mischief?"

     "I hope not," said Miss Stevens; "but, to you, Sir Francis, I owe
everything.  I am grateful to you for your ready and effectual aid under 
such
trying circumstances.  I am sure I never can repay you for your goodness."

     "Nay, the task is easier than you imagine," said Sir Francis; "to know
that I have saved you, and to see it has been effectual, is repayment 
enough.
I am sure we never feel so much satisfaction and pleasure as when we find 
our
endeavours, however important or unimportant they are, have proved 
effectual--
that we have done what we desired to do-- that is ample reward."

     "You are so good, Sir Francis."

     "We will say nothing about that.  None are so perfect but we may see 
room
for amendment; but we will have a truce, I hope, upon this subject, and now
converse upon the pleasures of our journey."

     "They, I hope, will be very many," said Mrs. Fraser.

     "I have every expectation of it myself," said Sir Francis; "the day
appears fine, and the sun is high.  The storm of last evening has cleared 
the
air of much of its heat; it is cool and pleasant.  The country will look
refreshed, the fields will be quite gay and pleasant, and the face of nature
renewed."

     "Well, I am certain it will be a pleasant journey under such a change,
for I must say it was very sultry yesterday."

     "It was," said Captain Fraser; "the appearance of the earth alone will
tell that.  But are you all ready?"

     "Yes, all," replied Mrs. Fraser.

     "Now, my dear Charles, what are you about?"

     "I'm looking for my gloves," said the youth; "but I can't find them."

     "Never mind them; we shall be off without you."

     "I'll come before you have all got into the carriage, so don't wait."

     "Permit me, Miss Stevens," said Sir Francis, as he offered his arm, "to
have the pleasure of seeing you safe into the carriage."

     They young lady accepted of the proffered arm of Sir Francis, though 
not
without something like reluctance, though, why, she could not tell; but yet
she did not like to appear to hesitate, and forced herself to do what common
courtesy, if not gratitude, demanded she should do.  She took his arm, and 
the
whole party were shortly seated in the carriage, and with Sir Francis Varney
mounted beside them, they all quitted the inn, where they had experienced 
such
strange vicissitudes of fortune during one night, that it would never be
erased from their memories.

 Next Time: The Road, and the Travellers. -- The Pleasures of Doing Good. --
 The Beggar Woman. -- Sir Francis Varney a Philanthropist.




                            CHAPTER CXXXVIX. [sic]

                               [Chapter 148]

THE ROAD, AND THE TRAVELLERS. -- THE PLEASURES OF DOING GOOD. -- THE BEGGAR
WOMAN. -- SIR FRANCIS VARNEY A PHILANTHROPIST.


     The road was pleasantly bounded on either side by hill and dale 
scenery,
while it was itself of a very diversified character; and at one moment they
passed through long avenues of trees, at other times a bare heath, without 
so
much as a dwarf hedge; and then well-cultivated country would succeed, 
studded
with handsome villas, and country seats, old half-castellated mansions and
halls, where gentlemen lived in the abodes of their ancestors, and felt 
pride
in doing so.

     The air was balmy and beautiful -- every object appeared fresh, and 
every
tree and shrub looked as though new life had been infused into it; the birds
sang merrily, and the whole party were in high spirits.

     "Such scenes as these," said Sir Francis Varney, "please me better than
the gaieties and follies of the town.  I am sure there is much more 
happiness
to be found by a contented mind, than there is in the feverish pleasures of 
a
city."

     "There is much truth in that, Sir Francis," said the captain; "but, in 
my
own case, connected as I am with my professional friends, I cannot follow 
what
is the natural bent of my taste; but I find pleasure wherever I go, for I am
determined to make the best of all that passes beneath my observation."

     "Sweets can be extracted from every bitter, and therefore it is good
philosophy to take the bright side of a picture, in all the ordinary 
relations
of life; we are better men and better subjects by so doing."

     Thus the distance was soon passed over, and a stage was but the same as 
a
pleasant morning ride; and then an hour or two spent of the heat of the day 
in
quiet in some small, but respectable, inn, with wine and pleasing
conversation, gave them a relish for the life they led.

     The style of the conversation of the stranger, Sir Francis Varney, was
pleasing in the extreme; he was evidently a man of great and varied talents
and attainments, and one of great experience, and who had seen much of life.

     Two days passed this way, and they had not reached Bath; they were
tempted to stop longer by the way than they would have done.

     "To-morrow," observed Sir Francis, "we must reach Bath.  About three
short stages will place us within its precincts, and then I presume the
assembly-room, as well as the pump-room, will occupy much of your attention.

     "We shall certainly go there."

     "Have you been in Bath before?"

     "Yes, but many years ago, when we were quite children, so that I have 
no
recollection of the place."

     "And you, Captain Fraser?"

     "No, I have not, I am quite a stranger there; but for the kindness of
your offer, I should have to trust to strangers, or my own good fortune, to
find out those things which strangers usually seek, and those places they
usually visit."

     "I shall have great pleasure in showing you that which is worthy of 
your
attention.  It is now some years since I was there; but I believe, though
there may be improvements, yet the place is essentially the same."

     "No doubt; cities seldom alter much, unless it be in their suburbs.  If
the alteration be great, it will point itself out."

     "Exactly so."

     The party were seated beneath a large cedar tree, which stood in the 
inn
garden, with a table, upon which were spread some wine and biscuits, 
walnuts,
and a few things besides, of a character agreeing much with the place.

     Into this garden crept an unfortunate beggar woman, who, espying the
party from the road, escaped the vigilance of the waiters and menials who 
hung
about the inn, and entered.  She crept timidly towards the party, looking
wistfully, but yet fearful of the consequences of the intrusion; for there 
was
a notice in the village, which gave forth fearful threats to them, should 
they
dare to beg for the bread for which they were starving.

     Presently, finding the captain's eye fixed upon her, with a beseeching
look, she dropped her curtsey.

     "Who is that woman, and what does she want?"

     All turned to look upon the unfortunate creature, who began her 
petition
by saying, --

     "Kind ladies and gentlemen, pity a poor woman who is starving.  I am 
very
weary, and am weak with travelling ---"

     "Eh! what do you do here?" exclaimed the waiter.  "Come, come, we don't
allow beggars in this place.  The high roads, or the Bridewell, are the only
places we have in these here parts."

     "Do not be in a hurry," said Sir Francis, to the officious waiter.  "It
might have been right enough to prevent her entering; but now we have seen
her, I cannot, if she deserve it, refuse to aid her in her affliction."

     The woman dropped a very low curtsey.

     "My good woman, where have you come from?"

     "From Bath, sir," said the unfortunate creature.

     "From Bath, eh?  And what took you there?"

     "I lived there."

     "You lived there; if that were the case, why should you leave a place
where you did live, to wander about where you cannot live?  That is a bad
policy, methinks.  What do you say, captain?"

     "I think so too, Sir Francis," said the captain; "but that may be only 
a
verbal blunder of the woman; we can't expect propriety in speaking from such
people; it would be expecting too much."

     "So it would," said Mrs. Fraser.

     "I have left Bath for two reasons, sir," said the woman; "one is, I was
too unwell to work, and then my rent got into arrears.  While I could work, 
I
did pay my way, though living very hard."

     "And what was the other reason?"

     "Why, sir, I was turned out of my lodging, and having nowhere to go to,
and finding nobody would assist me, was compelled to beg."

     "What induced you to take this road, my good woman?"

     "Because, sir, it will, if I live long enough, carry me to Portsmouth."

     "Are you known there?"

     "No, sir."

     "What induces you to go so far?  Speak out and do not be afraid; we 
have
no object in asking you questions, save with the view of assisting you if we
find you a worthy object."

     "I am going to Portsmouth," replied the poor creature, "in the hope 
that
I may hear from my son, whom I have not seen these many years, and who went 
to
sea about seven years ago."

     "You have a son then?"

     "Yes, sir, I had one.  God knows if I have one now."

     The poor woman uttered these words with such sorrowing [accents], that 
all
were convinced of the truthfulness of them.

     "Speak out and tell us your story.  Bring the poor woman some
refreshment," said Sir Francis; "her tale may interest us, and give us food
for ref[lection].  I am sure one cannot hear the misfortunes of others, 
without
feeling grateful for the luxuries and blessings one enjoys [over] and above 
the
common lot of mankind."

     "That is very true, Sir Francis," said Mrs. Fraser; "and I am sure we
ought not to pass those whom we can assist by a trifle, when our means will
permit our doing so."

     "You are perfectly correct, ma'am."

     "Have you no husband?" inquired Mrs. Fraser.

     "None, ma'am, none.  When I had one, I had a good home over my head.  I
would not wish for happier or better days to come again."

     "What was your husband?"

     "A respectable tradesman, who kept a good house and his own servants.  
We
spent such a life as that for nearly fifteen years."

     "And how came it to a close?"

     "His death, sir, which was brought on by a sudden cold; in a few days 
he
was a corpse.  I can never forget that dreadful day.  We were living very
comfortably and happy.  My husband had just at that time entered into some
speculations that promised to make a handsome fortune in a few years; and 
all
promised success and happiness, complete and continued."

     "How great a change!" said Miss Stevens.

     "Yes, miss, great indeed.  My husband hearing some news that caused him
to be anxious to ascertain its truth, he left home one wet night, and got
drenched through; and where he went to, he was obliged to remain in damp
clothes, and not being a strong man, he took a violent cold, and 
inflammation
followed.

     "After this he had medical advice; but he soon sank, and was pronounced
beyond recovery; he died a very few hours after that, and I was left a 
widow.
A few short hours caused a great change in my circumstances."

     "What became of the business?"

     "Why, that was carried on for a time; but an accident deprived me of
that."

     "What was that?"

     "I will tell you, sir.  My son was about fourteen years of age when his
father died, and was just able to carry on the business; and I believe we
should have done pretty well, because he was a steady youth, and I could 
trust
him; and he looked after the men employed, and I was not robbed.

     "However, a severe misfortune awaited me.  I thought the loss of my
husband a dreadful misfortune; and I believe it was; but in his case he left
one behind who could help to maintain me.  His loss I mourned; but it did 
not
produce the same disastrous results that the loss of my son produced."

     "How came you to lose him?" inquired the captain.

     "Why, sir, I had occasion to have some business transacted at Bristol.  
I
could send no one else, though I could ill spare him; but then I was 
compelled
to send him, and did send him.  It was to accommodate some terms of sale; 
and
he only knew the affair.  He, therefore, went to Bristol.  He was pleased
enough, being his first journey; and I could hardly have resisted his
importunity, if I had been so inclined.

     "He left me, and arrived safely in Britol, and was there a day or two,
when, walking about one evening by the water-side, he was seized by a
press-gang, and carried out to sea.  It was useless for him to complain or 
to
entreat; they would take him, and forced him on board a man-of-war."

     "He served his king and country, then?" said the captain.  "I honour 
him,
upon my soul; and you are going to learn something of him-- if he be dead or
alive?"

     "Yes, sir; I know this much, he was alive about two years ago, and
expected to reach Portsmouth in a couple of years."

     "Well, proceed."

     "When I heard my fate-- the detention of my son-- I was thrown on a bed 
of
illness, in which I lay for nearly three months, during which time I was
completely robbed, and run into debt; and when I recovered, I had but a few
pounds in the world, for an execution had been put into the house, and all 
was
sold.

     "Thus was I left without a friend or a soul to comfort me, or any
relative upon whom I could call for aid and assistance.  I had no right to 
do
so to any one; and after my misfortunes, I found that my former friends
deserted me.  I found that it was necessary to have the means of purchasing
friends, just the same as anything else.  I could obtain them for money; but
without money I had no friends."

     "I was by far too independent to ask for what I felt I was capable of
earning.  I could live upon little, and I at once left all who had formerly
known me, before I attempted anything.  I was determined that I would not 
even
ask work at their hands, but get it among strangers.

     "Of course this caused me to seek a subsistence in the lowest capacity,
and I cared not for it, because it put a still greater barrier between me 
and
my late acquaintances.  It was a long time before I obtained any employment,
because I was unknown to any one who could recommend me, or who wanted my
services.

     "This was to be expected; but the first place I obtained work at was
through the interest of my landlady; and then I obtained more afterwards, 
and
one led to another, till I obtained a hard-earned but honest living.

     "I had a little money by me-- some two or three pounds; in case of 
being
out of work, or in case illness overtook me, then I had something to fly to,
the workhouse being a place of all others I most dreaded; sooner than go 
there
I would consent to die by the roadside, and I have put my resolution to the
test."

     "You lost your work?"

     "I fell ill for some months; all my little store of money was gone, and
my rent grew in arrear.  I became more and more deeply indebted, and what 
food
I obtained was given me by others out of charity; but this could not last
long, and a soon as I was able to walk, my landlady asked me for my rent.

     "I then told her that I had no money, but that, in a few weeks, if I
could find food to enable me to get up my strength, I should then be able to
work, and I would then pay her off by degrees, until I was out of debt.

     "She knew what I had been, and had some thought that I had money, or if 
I
pleased I could obtain it from my former friends, and expected me to make 
the
attempt; but this I refused, and upon my doing so, she, after the first
expressions of astonishment and anger, gave me the alternative of doing so 
or
leaving the house.

     "I was turned out, and had no refuge.  I wandered about, and knew not
where to go, or what to do; indeed, I was houseless and friendless-- a
wanderer without a penny.  I could not now obtain work-- I could not do it;
and my appearance caused people to shut their doors against me, and I 
wandered
about begging.

     "This was the first time I ever took what I had not earned, save what 
was
voluntarily given me when I was ill.

     "One evening, as I was creeping about, I heard some men conversing 
about
the different vessels that were out at sea, and one of them named the one in
which my son was.  I instantly listened, and heard one of them say that she
was on her voyage homewards, and would be home in a month.

     "I had no sooner heard this than I had some hope.

     "'I will go,' I said, 'to Portsmouth.  I will meet my son, and he will
not refuse to support his unfortunate mother.  I know his disposition too 
well
to dream of it; and should he be unable to do so, I will beg for him.'

     "I slept in Bath that night, and then began to consider how I should 
get
to Portsmouth.  It was a long road; many weary miles must be walked over ere 
I
could get there; and as for the means, I must trust to the charity of the
passengers.  It would not be much more than what I was doing.  I could sit 
on
a doorstep and beg; but to walk on the road where there were few or no
passengers, I might starve.

     "However, I resolved to make the attempt, because I loved my son; and 
if
I could see him I should see an end to my misery.

     "I started out about four days ago, and I have got this far; but I have
had only bread on the road, and almost despair of being able to reach there;
and the charity of people is not enough to support life upon."

     "And where have you slept as you came along?"

     "Wherever I could, sir; beneath the haystack, or even a hedge."

     "Where did you sleep last night?"

     "Beneath a haystack about seven miles from this place."

     "And is that all you have got through to-day?"

     "Yes, sir, every step; and considering my weak state, I consider it 
good
travelling, and shall feel thankful for even that rate of travelling.  You 
do
not know how intensely I wish to get to see my son."

     "I have no doubt of it, my good woman, and if I can, I will help you on
the road.  I think yours is a case that deserves some attention.  If you
choose to remain here all night and rest, you may.  You shall have food till
you go, and some food shall be placed in your hands before you go."

     "Got bless you, sir," said the poor woman, in tears; "you will, indeed,
do an act of kindness to me."

     "You will stop?"

     "And be be grateful to you for your kindness."

     "Here, waiter," said Sir Francis.

     "Yes, sir," said that worthy, running up.

     "Just take this person, and see that she wants for nothing-- let her 
have
a bed here and breakfast in the morning, and let me know what the charges 
are,
and I will pay for it-- do you hear what I say to you."

     "Yes, sir," exclaimed the waiter, who considered the charge as one
beneath his dignity; but he was forced to obey, and the woman was desired to
follow him, which she did, after thanking Sir Francis Varney for his 
humanity
and generosity.

          *             *             *             *             *

     "Upon my word, Sir Francis," said Mrs. Fraser, "you do those things as 
if
they were common occurrences to you."

     "Why, madam, I am-- and perhaps I ought to abstain from making the
confession-- one who does not love to come in contact with misery; but then
one does not feel justified in turning away from it."

     "You must have a deep purse to be able to satisfy all such claimants."

     "I cannot do that, if I were inclined, or they were deserving, which 
many
are not, as you no doubt must be well aware."

     "Indeed, that is a fact.  Very few of the claimants possess the same
strength of right to our pity and commiseration.  I am certainly struck with
the woman's manners, and her artless mode of telling her story."

     "Exactly.  It bears the impress of genuineness about it."

     "So it does."

     "And when that is the case, I cannot resist the sense of my duty, which
impels me to aid the distressed.  But then I injure no one.  I have ample
means; and, therefore, others may do less, and yet deserve more credit.  I
have no heirs to come into my property, and I cannot, therefore, injure any
one; if I were to give it all away, I should be entitled to do so."

     "You are as good, Sir Francis, as you are courageous and fortunate," 
said
Miss Stevens; "I am sure I have every reason to be thankful to you for two
preservations."

     "Nay, say no more about the past; you say things at which I ought to
blush to hear, for my modesty is greater than you imagine; but, seriously, I
take more pleasure in it than most people, and that may be a set-off against
my disinterestedness, for I am only laying out my money in pleasure and
amusement."

     "No, no, that will not pass."

     "It will, I hope; but permit me to return and see how they have 
disposed
of this temporary protege of mine."

     "Certainly, Sir Francis; don't let us detain you; we shall remain here
some time longer, and then we shall leave the shelter of this house."

 Next Time: The Entrance into Bath. -- A New Scene. -- The Hotel and the
 Lodgings. -- The Attentions of Sir Francis Varney.




                             CHAPTER CXL. [sic]

                               [Chapter 149]

THE ENTRANCE INTO BATH. -- A NEW SCENE. -- THE HOTEL AND THE LODGINGS. -- 
THE
ATTENTIONS OF SIR FRANCIS VARNEY.


     After Sir Francis Varney had left the place where the Frasers were
sitting, there was a long silence, in which each of the party appeared to be
engaged in meditating deeply upon something or other, and yet each shrunk 
from
expressing them.  The first who broke the silence was Captain Fraser, who
said, --

     "Well, my dear, what do you think of our new acquaintance?"

     "I think he is a most amiable man."

     "Very courtly," observed his his sister.

     "Yes; a sure sign of good breeding-- of good company."

     "He is that," said Captain Fraser.  "I never met with one in whom
dignity, ease, and complete and unceremonious courtesy were so blended."

     "And he appears to be a very kind and amiable man."

     "But," said Miss Stevens, "he is also a very strange and a very 
singular
man-- a very singular man indeed!  I never saw such a man before, or any one
approaching him.  What a strange complexion!"

     "He has a singular complexion, and it strikes me he is well aware of 
it,
and that is the reason why he prefers a country to a town life; and his
solitariness, together with his manners, all indicate that his peculiarity 
in
this respect causes him much annoyance."

     "I dare say it may," said Captain Fraser.

     "I never saw anything so truly terrible!" said Charles.

     "Hush! do not speak in that way, Charles; it is ungrateful."

     "I hope not; it is merely the truth.  I never saw a corpse so pale!
Indeed he is just such an one as you might imagine to have started out of a
grave with an unwholesome life, and whoever had resuscitated him had 
forgotten
to warm his blood, or to put blood into his veins."

     "How very absurd you are, Charles!  I am sure Sir Frances Varney 
deserves
better of you than that.  You are under a great obligation to him.  I feel
assured he feels the peculiarity of his complexion-- I mean it has an effect
upon his mind; and, if we knew the cause of it, it is possible some
disinterested action, terminating in evil to himself, has been the cause of
it."

     "Well, sister, I do not mean to say that you can admire such a visage;
but you ought not to say I am ungrateful, for I am not; and, moreover, I 
never
saw any gentleman whom I liked better-- his conversation is quite superior;
but then, gratitude, surely, does not prevent one noticing so glaring a
circumstance."

     "Certainly not," said Captain Fraser; "though I fancy it would be 
better
to remain silent upon such topics, if we cannot commiserate them."

     "I think you are quite right, Fraser," said Mrs. Fraser; "he deserves
respect at our hands, and the less that is said in regard to his misfortunes
the better."

     "I think the evening is getting very cool," said Miss Stevens; "will 
you
remain here any longer? -- I shall return to the house."

     "We may as well all go-- especially if you feel chilly."

     "I do."

     "Then come along; to-morrow we shall be in Bath.  Come, sister, you 
must
be quite well to share in the gaieties of the place.  You know you said you
should have the greatest pleasure there-- you have been anticipating it all
along."

     "I did," said her sister.

     "Well, but you will do so now.  Why should your expectations not be
fulfilled?  I can see no reason why they should not.  Bath is a gay place, 
and
a city apparently made soley for the amusement of those who can pay for 
them."

     "I have been so alarmed and terrified, sister."

     "I know that, my dear; but you have had now two days' constant change 
of
scene, and lived, I may say, almost wholly in the open air, so that you 
ought
not now to be very nervous, sister."

     "I might have been worse under other treatment," replied Miss Stevens;
"but at the same time you can have no idea of what it is to suffer from such
an outrage; you cannot conceive anything like it."

     "I dare say not; I am sure it must have been dreadful."

     "It must," said the captain; "but we will not say anything about a 
matter
so disagreeable and so inexplicable."

     "Suppose we go in."

     "With all my heart; we shall be in Bath to-morrow, and you will have
nothing to fear; how does your arm feel now?"

     "Sore, but much of the inflammation has gone down; that I think will 
soon
be well, and then I shall be able to use it as I used to do; I don't think 
it
will leave any permanent injury of evil behind."

     "I am glad of it," said the captain.

     They now all returned to the inn, while the whole of the party passed 
the
remainder of the evening in company, retiring at an early hour with the view
of rising early for the purpose of getting into Bath in the afternoon, or
before the evening set in, at all events.

          *             *             *             *             *

     The next morning came, and with it a cloudless sky.  They were all in
high health and spirits, and sat down to a breakfast that was especially
prepared for them.

     "What has become of your protege?" said Mrs. Fraser to Sir Francis.

     "I have not seen her this morning.  I have not risen long, and I have 
had
no time to spare, but intend to see her before I go, and see that she has
means to reach Portsmouth in safety."

     "Will you send for her here, Sir Francis?"

     "Certainly, if you wish it," said Sir Francis; "I will tell the waiter 
to
inquire if she be ready, and, before she goes, to send her up."

     "That will be the best."

     This accordingly was done, and in about a quarter of an hour the poor
woman came up to the room; there were several alterations for the better in
her appearance, and she did not look so careworn and cast down as she had
done; she appeared thankful, and refreshed with rest and food.

     "You are now ready to start, my good woman?" said Sir Francis.

     "I am, sir, thanks to you."

     "I wish you all possible success in your mission, and I hope your son 
may
be living, and prove grateful to you, as his mother."

     "If living, I am sure he will, sir; and I do not doubt now but I shall 
be
able to meet with him, thanks to your bounty."

     "I hope you may.  Have they treated you well in the house, below?"

     "Yes, very well, sir, and kindly."

     "I am glad of it.  Have you any food given you to carry you on your
road?"

     "I have, thank you, sir."

     "Then there remains now nothing to be done, but to give you some silver
to enable you to provide lodgings, and now and then a lift on the road."

     "Thank you, sir," said the unfortunate widow, as she took the silver
which Sir Francis held out to her.  She could only shed tears of gratitude;
and Miss Stevens added some to it from her own pocket.

     "You have our best wishes," said Sir Francis Varney.  "Go now; we have
done all we can for you-- good day."

     "God bless you," said the woman; "may you never experience misfortune, 
or
ever know the want of even luxuries; you who can give, deserve to have.  The
poor and unfortunate have few such as you, sir, for benefactors."

     "That will do," said Sir Francis.  "Good day to you."

     "Good day, ladies and gentlemen," said the woman, curtseying low, and
then turning round, she left the apartment.

     "Poor thing," said Sir Francis, "she has a long journey before her.  A
temporary aid given to poor people, often lifts them above want, and places
them in a decent position in society.

     "So it does," said Mrs. Fraser.

     "Yet, you see, people disclaim charity, and say private charity is
pernicious in its effects.  But are there not two sides to any picture?  An
individual might as well say it was pernicious to take medicine because 
people
sometimes poison thmesleves with some of the ingredients.  Besides that, it
does good to the state; for it often prevents such a one from coming to the
state, and being a burthen upon society at large.  I am really of opinion 
that
much temporary distress might by aid be avoided; while, without that aid, it
would, in all probability, become permanent."

     "There is much wisdom in what you have said, Sir Francis; though you 
must
be aware that it opens a door to much abuse and reliance upon the charity of
others, which can scarcely be credible."

     "Oh, yes; I expect there is an abuse of everything; but we do not, from
that, argue its total cessation."

     At that moment the landlord entered the room, saying the carriage was
ready, as it had been ordered.

     "Then we may as well at once proceed to the carriage, which is waiting,
and we are ready to depart."

     "And," added Sir Francis, "I am ready too."

     They once more left the house they had slept in, and the carriage again
bore them onwards towards the city of Bath, which was now only three short
stages from them; and where they could arrive at almost any hour they 
pleased,
if they chose rapid  travelling; but this they did not, because it deprived
them of much of the pleasure of travelling -- the views and beauties on the
road.

     There were many gentlemen's seats on the road, which called forth 
comment
and admiration; as well as many smaller estates and houses, that were often
picturesquely situated, as well as lonely.

     At length they came within sight of the famed city; and, each moment 
they
neared it, saw fresh evidences of a large and populous place.  However, they
stopped not; but the closer they came to the town the faster they went, 
until
they were really within the city.

     "Here we are in Bath at length," said Sir Francis.  "It is a fine city,
and much of fashion and talent may be found here."

     "I am glad we have arrived here at last," said Captain Fraser.

     "And so am I," said Mrs. Fraser; "for I am almost tired of riding every
day.  I begin to want rest; I want to stop for a time in one place."

     "We get fatigued, even with a change," said the captain, "after a time;
and yet our lives are a complete round of change."

     "Yes; if you consider the character of time."

     They now stopped at one of the principal hotels, into which they all
entered, and ordered their dinner; and, while the ladies arranged themselves
for the occasion, Sir Francis Varney and Charles walked out into the town,
where they amused themselves with looking at the different objects which 
were
presented to the gaze of the stranger.  In all these things Sir Francis
appeared to be well versed -- knew what was now, and what had been formerly.

               *             *             *             *             *

     Two days had passed by, and there had been but little time lost, so far
as the visiting of one part of the city and another was concerned, and they
gradually became acquainted with and visited the different places of 
amusement
-- at least, so many of them as could be visited by them in the time.

     Sir Francis Varney was the chaperon; and, as he obtained attention and
consideration wherever he went, he was a valuable aid and assitance, and the
family had now got quite used to him, and he to the family.

     The peculiarity of his countenance or complexion wore off, his pleasing
manners producing an effect that acted as an antidote to that, which was
likely to cause some peculiar feeling in all who looked at him; but his
courtly manners completely took from any one with whom he came in contact 
the
power and the desire to exhibit any dislike or aversion.

     However, there was not one among all those who looked upon him who did
not look upon him with various emotions; but they were only such as result
from a source that acted upon their feelings and tastes, without producing 
any
deep or permanent emotion in any one.

     Great care was taken by Sir Francis in dress, and his display was
altogether good, but there was no ostentation; his manners were those of a 
man
who was used to the position and sphere above what he even then moved in.

     There was no mistake in the matter at all, and the Frasers were well
convinced that he was what he appeared to be; and there was, moreover, an
evident partiality for Miss Stevens manifested by him, which had already 
been
more than once remarked by the captain and his lady, who tacitly approved of
the honour, though nothing was broached on either side.

     "Sir Francis appears to be a very gentlemanly man," said the captain.

     "Very," said the lady -- "very.  I never saw one whom I could find so
little fault with; indeed, I may say he had none."

     "That is a very extensive compliment, at all events," said the captain.
"No fault is a thing you can say of but very few people indeed."

     "I mean, as far as personal behaviour is concerned.  Of course I know
nothing more; his demeanour appears perfectly unexceptionable.  I am sure I
never saw any one at all his equal in that respect."

     "Perhaps not.  He appears to be very attentive to your sister; indeed, 
I
should say he appears to be very partial."

     "I think so too.  What do you say to Sir Francis Varney, Mary," 
inquired
Mrs. Fraser, "as a lover, eh?"

     "I cannot think of him in such a light," said Miss Stevens.

     "And wherefore not?" inquired the captain.

     "Because I could not bear the idea.  I don't know why-- I can't tell 
you;
but I could not do so-- it would be against my nature to accept of such a
lover.  It would much pain me to refuse one who had done so much for me; but 
I
could not accept of him."

     "Upon my word you appear to feel strangely upon this matter," said the
captain; "but I think you might think twice before you answered thus."

     "No; think how much I might, it could make no alteration in my mind; 
for
the more gratefully I think, and the more I endeavour to be, yet the 
stronger
would be my repugnance to have such a man for a lover."

     "Dear me, Mary! how can you say so?"

     "I do indeed."

     "Ah, well! girls will be girls; but he has not done you the 
distinguished
honour to ask you, so you must not refuse in anticipation.  You may consider
the grapes are sour because they hang so high."

     "You ask me a question, to which I have given you the best answer I can
upon the moment.  Besides, we know nothing of Sir Francis."

     "We know enough of him, I think, to speak and think with the utmost
gratitude of him.  Not that that should make any of us overlook the
precautions that are usual on such occasions.  And as for your opinion, why,
that might be amended by time; and I am sure that what we do know of him is
enough to cause us to respect him, and to have confidence in him.  He has 
not
sought our acquaintance, and that is one guarantee in his favour."

     "So it is."

     "But all this is useless.  Sir Francis appears very sensitive.  He is 
of
retired habits and tastes, and, perhaps, something of that may result from 
the
disadvantage under which he lies, which he may feel severely."

     "So he might; and, therefore, I would never, if I could help it, make 
any
personal allusion of any character before him, even though I were speaking 
of
some one else, and it had no reference to him, as he might apply it to
himself."

     "That is quite right, and just what [i]t ought to be."

     Sir Francis Varney, when he walked out into the city of Bath, appeared 
to
be lost in deep thought, and walked along as if he saw nothing that was 
going
on aroung him; he was lost in meditation -- something weighed heavy upon his
mind, and he now and then muttered inaudibly to himself.

     Whatever might have been his purpose, he merely wandered about without
going to any one place, as if he were in the search for an adventure, rather
than having any specific and determinate object.  But, after much wandering
about, he came near the corner of a street, where he saw two persons
conversing together.  A stray word appeared to rivet his attention, and he
paused, and then stepped into the shadow of a doorway and listened.

     "You see, Martha, Aunt Matthew is an old miser.  She would sooner see 
all
the world at the last gasp, before she would dream of parting with a 
shilling.
I am sure it is much too bad."

     "What is too bad?"

     "Why, that she, and such as she, should have so much money, and others,
who would work hard, should have none, or even the means of procuring it."
 
     "Yes, it is hard; and yet if those who have it did not keep it, there
would be no one who would be worth money."

     "That is all very well; but the more money circulates, the more hands 
it
gets into; and that, of course, enriches every one who has for a time the
possession of it, for they do not part with it unless they have value for 
it."

     "Well, well, that may do very well; but it does not appear to me to be
any business of mine that such an one should beg anything of anybody else; 
but
no matter, she has money enough."

     "She is single, is she not?"

     "Yes," replied the other.

     "Then you may, after all, possess all she has."

     "I may, but she is fat and forty; she may live for years, and in the
menatime I may be a beggar all my life."

     "No, no, not so bad as that."

     "And what is worse than all, while she is living, she is decreasing the
money she has, and it will yearly get less and less, till, if any comes to 
me,
it will be so small a portion of it, that I am sure there will be but little
good come of it."

    "Indeed.  If she be such a miser as you speak of, I should have imagined
that the property, personal or real, would increase under such management as
that."

     "It would, if she were not living on the principal."

     "On the principal-- what do you mean?"

     "That she lives on the principal, as I told you.  She has got some
strange fancies in her head, and one of them is, that the banks will break,
all and every one of them, from one end of the kingdom to the other."
 
     "What a notion."

     "Yes, and that is not all; she believes that all banks will break, so 
all
the public securities will be of no use, but only so much waste paper; and
real property will all be seized, and there will be I don't know what
universal ruin, desolation, and disorganization."

     "What does she do?"

     "Why, keeps all her cash at home; and then goes to her strong box and
takes out her bright gold guineas, which appear in such abundance, that it
would seem as if it could never sensibly diminish; and thus she has been 
going
on for a matter of two years or more."

     "Upon my word, what can she dream of?  If she go on in that manner, I 
am
sure, too, that she will be a beggar."

     "That is certain; but she thinks not, and you can't argue her into any
other belief whatever that is contrary to this matter.  However, I have no
favour in her eyes, because I am her relative."

     "And why should that be?"

     "Because, bring her relative, she thinks I may be wishing her dead 
every
day she lives; so , you see, if she go on with this feeling about her, she 
may
take a complete dislike to me, and I should never have a farthing left me,
even if she died before all was gone, and dissipated."

     "Very true.  Where do you live?"

     "I have been living with my aunt.

     "Indeed!  And where may that be?" inquired her companion.

     "Where-- why, don't you know number one hundred and nine, Chapel-
street?
but I have left there-- that is, I shall do so to-night."

     "Will you?  You are wrong."

     "I doubt it, very much-- very much indeed."

     "What motive can you assert there is, to make it good policy in doing
this?"

     "She will think I do not care about waiting for her money; and that
motive being observed, I am sure it will influence her in my favour."

     "Then, you will not go back to-night?"

     "No, not at all."

     "Well, you know best; but I should.  However, I must now leave you, and
bid you good day.  I must go."

     "Good day," said the other, and they quitted the place.

     When the two speakers had left the spot, Sir Francis Varney came forth
from his hiding-place, and gazed after them for some moments in silence; but
when they were no longer in sight, he muttered, --

     "Could anything be more fortunate!  I am reduced to the last guinea.  I
have not another pound to pay my way with.  Just at a moment, too, when I
think I may be successful at last in securing a victim."

     He then walked onwards until he came to the neighbourhood of the street
he had heard the stranger name, and then he paused and approached the house
with some curiosity, but passed by it without stopping.

     It was a corner house, and a blank wall ran a short way down the 
street,
being the side of the house, and a small portion of ground called a yard; 
here
the wall was lower-- here there was a chance of getting over, and here Sir
Francis Varney paused a moment, as if examining the place with care and
scrutiny.

     He looked all around, and saw no one approaching; he heard no sound, 
and
he saw no face in any window that was within sight.  It was, moreover, too
dark to be seen, and he, without a moment's hesitation, ran a few paces
towards the wall, and by a violent effort succeeded in placing one hand upon
the summit, and then the other soon followed.

     Sir Francis Varney was a man of great agility and strength, and he was
not long in drawing himself up to the top, and then he dropped down.

     It was fortunate he dropped heavy, and also fortunate, from that
circumstance, he fell upon something soft.  The good fortune of the
occurrences was dependent upon each other.  We say it was fortunate he fell
heavy, because he fell upon the old lady's yard-dog, an unamiable cur, and
prevented an alarm, for the dog was crushed, and unable to utter a single 
howl
before the animal died.

     There was now nothing to do but enter the house if the back door was
open; but upon trial this proved not to be the case.

     This was a matter that required some consideration; the door was not to
be forced, and he hoped to get in by that means, but he was foiled; but yet 
it
was something to have possession of the yard, he could hide here; but yet 
that
increased his danger, for if he remained there, he was liable to a 
discovery,
and that, too, before any attempt had been made upon the coffers of the old
 woman, and no good effected by him.

     What to do he could scarely tell; but after some thought, he determined
to attempt the back windows in the parlour, or room above the ground; and to
effect this purpose, he would have to get upon a water-butt, and thence to 
the
railings facing the window of the room, and which appeared to have no
shutters.

     Having once made up his mind, he set about it at once, and was soon on
the top of the water-butt, and made good his hold upon the small balcony, 
and
then he drew himself up.

     This was a work of some difficulty, because the balcony was very close 
to
the window, and left him no room to lean over; but yet he succeeded, and 
found
to his great joy that the window was only closed without being fastened; he
had only cautiously and noiselessly to lift it up, and he could enter it.

     This he did at once, and then stood in the room; but all was dark, and 
he
could not hear a sound throughout the house, for he listened many minutes,
lest he might be suddenly intruded on by some one, and then there would be 
no
escape from there, and he would possibly lose all.

     Caution, therefore, was the order of the day, and he gently closed the
window, lest the draught might be felt in some of the other parts of the 
house.

     That was very fortunate, for there was every possibility of a discovery
resulting from such a course; for any one, feeling a greater than usual
draught, would soon inquire into the cause.

     Having got thus far, he opened the door and walked into the passage, 
and
then he heard the sound of conversation being carried on in an undertone; he
listened at the door, and heard two female voices.

     "Betty," said one.

     "Yes, ma'am," replied the other. 

     "Have you shut the shutters, and locked up all the doors?" 

     "Yes, ma'am.

     "The kitchen-door?"

     "Yes, ma'am-- all right as can be; nobody can get in, I'll warrant."

     "You don't say so?"

     "Oh, but I do; the dog's out in the yard, too."

     "When you have had tea, I'll have him brought in; he mustn't lay out
there, poor creature, to spoil his coat, and catch cold.  I'm almost 
thinking
I ought not to let him stay out to this hour."

     "He's well enough-- he'll not hurt-- he's got the kennel to sleep in, 
and
he's plenty of straw; there's many a one about these parts as would be glad 
of
such a bed.  I've taken care of him."

     "Very well, Betty; sit down to tea, and, when it is over, I'll bet you
anything that old Martha Bell will be here."

     "Lord bless me, ma'am, you don't say so!"

     "Yes, I do; but I won't be at home; she and I have fallen out of late,
and I'm not inclined to make up the quarrel, for she won't believe the banks
 will break, and you know they will, Betty."

     "To be sure, ma'am, they will-- I know very well they will; it's quite
certain-- as certain as the almanac."

     "Yes; and, what's worse, she wanted to borrow ten pounds, and that, you
know, will never do at any price; she would break, too, and then I should 
have
loss number one, and no one can tell how soon number two might follow."

     "He! he! he!" said Betty; "oh, lawks, I shall split." 

     "What's the matter now-- what are you laughing at, silly?"

     "Oh, you are so funny, ma'am; I'm sure you'd make anybody laugh-- you 
do
joke so, it makes one laugh." 

     "Laugh! -- what is there funny in losing ten pounds, I should like to
know?  Nobody would laugh at that, I should imagine; I am sure I should 
laugh
at nothing of that sort.  If you were to lose ten shillings, I am sure that 
I
should not laugh at you, nor do I think you would, either."

     "No, ma'am, I'm sure you would not, and I am sure I should not; but you
do say such things that make me forget all about the money."

     "Well, then, go down stairs and fetch some more coals."

     "Yes, ma'am," said Betty; and, before Sir Francis Varney had time to 
slip
back and open the door of the other room, the door of the one he was 
listening
at was suddenly opened, and Betty stood before him.

     She came out plump, before he had time to step back; and she ran 
against
him before she was aware any one was there; for coming from a room where 
there
was light, she could not see at all in the dark passage.

     "Oh, my----"

     She had got thus far in her exclamation, when she received a heavy blow
from the intruder, which felled her senseless to the floor, and, as quick as
thought, he drew his dress sword, and plunged the point through her heart. 
Not
a groan followed -- she was dead, and might be said to have died while 
bereft
of sense or motion.

     "What is the matter, Betty?" said the woman -- her mistress.

     No answer was returned, and Varney paused, as if uncertain what to do.
He was in some doubt if he should or not go in, or await the woman's 
approach
to where he stood.  He had not been seen, or she would have screamed out; 
and
if he went to her she would see him, and have time to alarm people.

     He paused, and awaited her coming; but she appeared to defer doing so,
and merely said, --

     "Betty-- Betty, what has ailed you?  What can be the matter?  You don't
mean to say that the tea has got into your head?  No, no," she muttered, 
after
a pause; "that can't be the case.  She must have been to my medicine bottle,
and that has been too strong for her.  I shall discharge her.  She'll be
breaking something or other, and then who knows where that will end-- begin 
by
breaking a basin, and end by breaking a bank."

     So saying, she muttered something unintelligible to Varney, and then
began to rise and walk along the room towards the door.

     This was a moment of suspense -- the door opened suddenly, and then she
stood before Varney, who made a rapid thrust with his sword.  This would 
have
been as fatal as that which he had dealt Betty, but the mistress was more
fortunate, at the moment, for a steel busk was the means of preventing its
taking effect.

     "Murder!  What do you want!  Oh, you wretch-- I know you now!  Depend
upon it you shall be hanged!  Murder-- murder!"

     "One word, and you are a corpse," said Varney.

     "Mercy-- mercy!  Will you spare me-- will you spare my life?" 

     "I will."

     "Oh, thank you-- thank you!  I never hurt you, and I don't think you
would me.  I am very sorry that I made any noise-- but you will spare me?"

     "Yes, upon one condition."

     "On a condition?" said the woman, tremblingly.

     "Yes, upon a condition."

     "Tell me what it is you require of me, and I will comply."

     "Then," said Varney, after a moment's pause, "show me where you keep 
your
money.  I must have money, so give me plenty."

     "Plenty of money, did you say?"

     "Yes, plenty.  I want some.  You have money I know-- gold-- gold in
quantity."

     "Ha, ha, ha! gold!  Oh, yes-- gold!  Ha, ha! how funny!"

     "Funny!  Is my sword funny?" asked Varney; "because, if you think so, 
you
may have a small portion of it, which you may consider funnier still."

     "No, no; but I have no money-- none at all, save a little money I have
for immediate expenses.  I have but little; for nobody now-a-days keeps 
money
in houses, if they can get any at any time."

     "But you have plenty of money."

     "I haven't any, upon my----"

     "You have.  You keep it in the house, you know, because the banks might
break, and you would lose all.  Now give me some at once, or you are dead as
any nail in your house-- mark that!"

     "Oh, dear! -- oh, yes!  What would you have of me?"

     "Money," said Varney, pressing the point of his sword against her side.

     "Oh, mercy!  I'll tell you all; but-- but you must be satisfied with 
what
I have got, and not leave me a beggar, or kill me because I have no more."

     "I will be satisfied with what you have got; but that I know to be much
more than I can carry away with me."

     "Oh, good lord, you don't know me, or else you would know the reverse 
of
that.  A poor lodging-housekeeper is not the person to have much money in 
the
house; but if the truth must be told, I have up stairs my quarter's rent,
which I ought to give my landlord.  I can give you that, but God knows how 
he
will believe me when I tell him I have lost it."

     "You have all your property about you.  You have gold in quantities."

     "I have not."

     "Then take the fruits of your obstinacy," said Varney, in a fury; and,
making a savage and sudden lunge at her, he passed his sword through her
breast, and with a smothered scream she fell to the earth, where she lay
gasping and writhing for several seconds, when a rapid gurgling sound came
from her throat, and she died.

     "'Tis done;" said Varney to himself; "'tis done, and it would have been
as well if I had done it as first; but no matter, 'tis done quietly."

     There lay the two bodies upon the flooring, the one in the passage by 
the
door, and the other in the parlour.  There was a long pool of black blood,
extending from one to the other of the two corpses-- they mingled their 
blood
in death, though they held different positions in life.  What could be done?
there they were, and even Varney could not pick his way without treading in
the blood.

     He at once entered the apartment, and began to examine the whole place,
but he did not find much there-- a few odd pounds, and yet he turned
everything upside down, to use a common phrase; but yet there was nothing of
the sort which he hoped for, and expected to find.

     "Can I have mistaken the place?" was his first thought.

     Upon consideration, he saw reason enough to make his mind easy upon the
score of mistakes in that matter.  There was the number and the street, and
the old woman, and her conversation answered exactly to what he had heard; 
and
after a few moments' consideration, he muttered, --

     "It must be right; there are more rooms than one in the house.  I will 
go
and search through the rooms, and if I don't find any, I will set the house 
on
fire.  Indeed, I think that will be better done, it will prevent the deed
taking light, and as little suspicion may be as well incurred as can be."

     This was a thing only thought of to be resolved on; but he cast that
aside, and proceeded with his search, and having finished that room, he
splashed through the blood, and once more stood in the passage.

     "And now for the bedrooms," he muttered. 

     The candle he held was the only one he could obtain, and he was 
compelled
to walk steadily, lest he should lose its aid by going out; however, he soon
got up stairs, and walked into the best bedroom, where he again began to
search about for the hidden treasure, but found it not.

     "Curses upon the stupidity of the old fool, where does she hide her
money?  I am sure she has it here, and I wanted to get back without delay.  
I
did not want to be away long, and here I have been, I dare say, an hour."

     This was true, and he turned things over and about in great hast; but 
his
endeavours had liked to have been useless, as regarded the discovery, only 
his
eye chanced to light upon a panel.

     He started up and pulled away a part the bed-curtains, behind which it
was partially concealed. 

     "Ha! ha! what have we here?  What I have been wishing to find, no 
doubt.
This is the secret hiding-place of her gold-- the treasury."

     However, whatever it might be, it did not appear to be in his power to
determine, for he could not open it.

     This was, of course, a provoking state of things; and Varney seized 
hold
of each implement that came to his hands, but threw each down again, being
unable to effect his object by any means whatever.

     He started up suddenly, after making many desperate attempts to break 
the
door open, which, however, were futile, and exclaimed, --

     "There are keys to these places, and I am sure the old woman must have
them about her, if this place be really the receptacle of her wealth, as I
have every reason to believe it is.  I will find out, if I can; no doubt,
however, I shall find it upon her somewhere-- I'll try."

     He immediately went down stairs and found the body of the old woman; it
was fast stiffening; but the clothes were all sopping in blood, and he 
turned
her over hastily until he found out the pocket; and from that he drew a 
bunch
of keys.  They were all bloody, but he did not hesitate about seizing them.
 
     "These will, no doubt, let me into the secret.  I shall find my way in,
now, and then the house will no longer hold me."

     He turned, and quitted the corpse; and, in going upstairs, he saw for 
the
first time that the stairs all bore the imprint of his own foot; he saw they
were stained in blood, and were clear, distinct, and well defined.

     "It matters not," he muttered; "fire will, and shall efface that; and,
besides, if it did not, what care I?"

     He ran up the stairs, and again entered the bedroom, and was once more
kneeling before the door of the cupboard.  The bunch of keys was composed of
many, and he tried one after the other, until, after many trials, he came to
one, which was of a peculiar make and shape, and which convinced him he was
now in possession of the right key.

     "I think I have succeeded, now," he muttered, as he put the key into 
the
lock.  It fitted very closely into the lock, and then it slowly turned, and
he saw the door open; but it only disclosed another door.

     "What is the meaning of this?" muttered Varney; "what, is there another
door to be found?  I suppose some of these keys will fit this as well."

     However, he was not compelled to make the search, for the key of this
 inner door hung up by one corner, on a little hook, in a niche which had 
been
 apparently cut out on purpose.

     This was soon opened, and then came rather a startling sight.

     In a small cupboard were packed a heap of human bones-- more than 
bones,
for they had yet the flesh dried and sticking to them-- the skull was brown
and bare, save here and there remained some hair.

     "What is the meaning of this?" he muttered, angrily -- "and have I
troubled myself in this manner for only these few bones?"

     It was, however, an apparent fact.  There was the place, and it was now
opened, and the contents were plain enough -- bones! -- bones! -- human 
bones!
There could be no mistake; and Varney rested his hand on his knee, and gazed
intently into the cupboard at the bones, and everywhere else.

     He was about to rise, when, somehow or other, he was induced to push 
the
bottom shelf-- why, he could not tell; but, when he had done so, he found it
give downwards.  Yes, the whole cupboard went down; he pushed, and pushed,
until the roof was no higher than the floor; then, indeed, he saw a sight 
that
caused him to feel a satisfaction.

     "Ah!" he exclaimed, "ah! this is what I have sought, and I will have 
it--
gold! -- gold! -- aye, here is gold in heaps, more than I can carry."

     He stretched forth his arm, and leaned into the cupboard, and then
examined the contents, and felt assured that there were several thousands of
pounds; the glittering heap before him was what he wanted, and for which he
had remorselessly committed such fearful crimes.

     "But I must make haste-- I must make haste.  I shall lose what I have
such a certainty of possessing."

     So muttering to himself, he put as much gold into his pockets as he
could, and carrying a bag under his arm, he re-locked the cupboard.  Having
retraced his steps below, he replaced everything; while at the same time he
carefully examined his person, to see that there were no traces of his deeds
upon him; and then, wrapping himself up in his cloak, he left the house, and
proceeded towards his hotel.

 Next Time: The Scene at the Hotel. -- The Relation of the Cause of Sir
 Francis Varney's Paleness.




                            CHAPTER CXLII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 151]

THE SCENE AT THE HOTEL. -- THE RELATION OF THE CAUSE OF SIR FRANCIS VARNEY'S
PALENESS.


     When Sir Francis Varney reached his hotel, he hurried to his own
apartment, and then he called for his luggage; and when that was brought to
him, and he was alone, he unlocked a portmanteau, and placed his gold in it;
and then, having taken care to dress himself, he again met the Frasers 
below,
at the evening meal.

     "I have been strolling the streets for an odd hour," he said, "and find
things pretty much as they used to be; I don't see many alterations worth
speaking of.["] 

     "And yet they say they are improving daily."

     "They may be; but only in parts and places; and it does not alter the
general plan of the place, though appearances may be benefitted."

     "Exactly; that, I dare say, may be the case; as, indeed, it is most
likely to be the fact, expecially when we see that, save in the case of 
entire
new streets, all improvements are effected by individual exertions."

     "Exactly; but life and happiness is the result of individual 
exertions,"
said Sir Francis; "but yet many shrink from prosecuting a scheme of 
happiness,
lest barriers be placed in their path that would be as injurious to all as
they are effectual."

     "Indeed, that is often the case."

     "I have met with many instances of blighted devotion since I have
wandered about over the green vales of England."

     "I dare say you have met with some adventures?"

     "I have, sir.  I have met with many that, perhaps, few men would have
ventured into, and ever expect to come out alive; but I have not done so
without paying dearly for my temerity."

     "Indeed; have you incurred much danger?"

     "I have, sir."

     "But still it must be pleasant to fall back upon the remembrances of 
the
past, and recall scenes and events that possess interest to your mind."

     "It is so.  I remember well that, some years ago, when I was in the
north, that an occurrence took place that has left a lasting memorial upon 
me,
and one I can never forget as long as I live."

     "It must have been a serious affair."

     "It was a serious affair-- a very serious affair.  I was going to
Scotland, when, by some accident, the carriage in which I was travelling 
broke
down, and it was unable to proceed, and I took up my abode at the nearest 
inn;
where I determined to remain until the carriage was repaired, which would, 
it
was said, take a couple of days, at the least.

     Well, in the evening of the first day, I walked about visiting the
different places where I could hope for any pleasure; in doing so, I was
wandering slowly down a lane, when I heard voices on before me.  The wind 
blew
from them to me, and I heard all they said.

     "Then this evening," said one.

     "Yes, yes; I consider this the most favorable opportunity than can be
taken advantage of."

     "Well, then, we had better go at once."

     "Yes; now we are on our road there, you see, and we shall be soon 
there;
there will just be light enough to reconnoitre."

     "Very well.  We can secret ourselves somewhere about the place, where 
we
shall not be discovered, and then we can get into the house at our leisure."

     "But we may have to meet with opposition."

     "Then, we must resist, too.  You don't intend to be taken, I suppose?"

     "No, not I."

     "What did you intend to do if you were caught?"

     "Fight my way out, or, if need be, I can push my knife into the ribs of
any one who may be in my way."

     "Right.  I shall be inclined to do for any one who wants to keep me
against my will-- you may reckon upon that for a certainty; and if the old 
man
but as much as moves or utters a single cry, I will do for him."

     "You don't mean that, do you?"

     "I do, and will do it."

     "Then I know, and I will do the same.  I like to have a pal that will
stick by me, and have no nonsense.  However, we need not be in a hurry, and
just do what is necessary-- go to work steadily and determinedly."

     "Agreed.  We will now go on-- strike off to the left here, and we come
then to the house.  There's only one man servant, but he can be dealt with;
and as for the old man himself, he cannot do much."

     Then they both proceeded across the fields until they came to some 
thick
wood, when I lost sight of them.

     Well, I knew the house they were both going to, and I determined to
proceed by another route to the same place.

     I followed the lane as far as it would go, and found it led up to the
very house which I had heard the men declare their intention of robbing, and
possibly of murdering the owners-- the inhabitants, I must say, for master 
or
servant alike they would not hesitate in destroying.

     I entered the house-- the door was open, -- after having walked up a
broad and stately avenue of linden trees which lined the way up to the hall
door.  I was for some moments unable to make any one hear, but soon after I
heard some one approaching the hall.  I paused, therefore, and presently 
there
came an elderly gentleman, with a grave but pleasant countenance, upon whose
shoulders fell a profusion of snow-white locks; he was venerable, yet 
pleasing
in the expression of countenance.

     He bowed when he saw me, but looked rather surprised.

     "I dare say, sir, you appear surprised at my intrusion; but I do not 
come
without a motive."

     "I dare say not, sir.  But you are welcome; will you walk in?"

     "Thank you," I said, "but I have come to put you on your guard against 
an
attempt at robbery, and possibly murder, that is to be made upon your house
to-night."

     "Indeed, sir.  I can hardly believe any one would be so wicked as to do
anything of the kind; and yet, I am sure you would not say so if you had not
some grounds for such a belief."

     "I have," I replied, "and I will relate them."

     I then related to him distinctly all that I had overheard in the lane,
and the direction the men had taken.  He appeared very thoughtful for some
moments, and then he said to me, as he led the way up stairs, --

     "Will you walk up stairs with me?"

     I did as he desired, and followed him up stairs, until he came to a 
samll
observatory erected in the top part of the house.

     "You say you saw them enter the copse between here and the lane 
yonder."

     "Yes, I did; and I imagine they may be seen if watch is kept in such a
place as this; for I am sure they intend to examine the house, as to the 
means
of approaching it, and they expect to find only yourself and a man-servant."

     "They would have met but little more, indeed; however, I am fore-
warned,
and I will take care to be fore-armed."

     "That is my object in coming to you; to effect this is all I seek; and
now I will bid you good evening, for I have got some distance to walk before 
I
can get back to the hotel where I am staying."

     "Are you staying at an hotel?"

     "Yes," I replied; and I named the place where I was stopping, when he
said, --

     "You are welcome, if you are pleased to do so, to remain here; I shall 
be
most happy with your company."

     "Thank you," I said; "and frankly I must say, I should like to see the
issue of this affair, and will accept of your invitation, though, perhaps, I
have accepted of your invitation too readily."

     "Not at all-- not at all, you are heartily welcome; we will sit up and
wait for these fellows; when we have beaten them off, we can retire in
security to rest, without fear of disturbance."

     "Do you see them?" I inquired, as he was looking through a telescope
towards the point I had named.

     "No, I do not see them yet," he said; "no, no; and yet I-- I think I 
see
something now through a portion of the copse-- it's difficult to tell what
they are about; if they go much further in that direction, they will be 
plain
enough; there-- there they are; I can see them both plainly enough."

     "Two of them?" said I.

     "Yes," he replied, "I see two; they appear to be looking this way; what
are they doing now?  Oh, I see, they are making for a place of concealment
nearer the house.  Well, sir, I am much obliged to you-- very much, indeed;
for you have evidently saved my house from being robbed, and myself from
murder-- I owe you my life."

     "Nay, sir, not so bad as that; the villains might not have been
successful enough to have effected an entrance before you were alarmed."

     "And if they had, what could I have done?  Why, truly, I have fire-
arms,
but I should have been loth to have used them, and my hesitating might have
cost me my life; so I have to thank you for life and property."

     "As you please," I said; "but what steps do you intend to take towards
your own and your property's preservation?"

     "I shall obtain the aid of another, and quietly await their coming; but
as I think, from their appearance, they are not mere country people who come
about robbing from distress, but men who make a kind of profession of
housebreaking, I will have both taken and dealt with according to law."

     "It is their deserts," I said, "for a more deliberately planned affair 
I
never yet heard of; and what makes it so very black, is the fact of their
early making up their minds to murder any one."

     "No doubt," he replied; "but that is an inducement to take them in the
fact.  I will send for one man, and, what with ourselves, we can secure the
villains; we are enough to do that."

     "They are desperate," I said.

     "But they will yield to numbers," he said."

     "No doubt; but there must be a yet greater number; the odds, in my
opinion, are not great enough to secure victory.  These are desperate men, 
for
they will not be taken, and two to one will not deter them-- one, or even 
two
lives may be sacrificed before they are secured, if they do not get off."

     "Well, then, you appear to think that we had better obtain more aid?"

     "I do," I replied.  "At least, a couple of men, if not, three, over the
number you first spoke of, if you wish it to be perfectly harmless in its
results."

     "I should so desire it," he replied.

     "Then you'll find that requisite," I answered.

     Then I was invited down stairs, and great hospitality shown me by the 
old
gentleman, who was an exceedingly pleasant companion.  He was well informed,
and a well read man, and was the only inhabitant of that large mansion.

     He had been many years a widower, and had but one child, a son, a young
man of great promise; he was abroad on a tour, and he was awaiting his 
return
with great anxiety, as he was somewhat longer than he had anticipated.

     We sat conversing for some hours.  We had a handsome supper, and
afterwards some choice wine, and then in came three stout countrymen.

     "My friends," he said, "I want you to keep watch and ward to-night in 
my
house, to protect it from robbers."

     They agreed to do so, but expressed some surprise at what had occurred,
and appeared to believe it hardly possible that any one could have been 
wicked
enough to compass such an object.

     However, he told them all I had said, and they were sent below, where
they were served with a very good supper, and promised reward, with
injunctions not to speak after a certain hour.

     This all arranged, I and my host seated before a fire, and with some
wine, we passed the time agreeably enough.

          *             *             *             *             *

     "The time passes," said my host, as the clock chimed the hours.  "I
wonder if anybody is about now?"

     "I should think," I replied, "they must be about thinking of what they
have in contemplation.  I am sure it is a quiet hour in this part of the
world, and I should imagine that no human being can be asake about here."

     "None, I dare say, save ourselves, and our assailants, if they have not
altered their minds, and given up their intentions, or altered the night 
they
intended for the attempt.  Who can tell? they may have done so."

     "I hope not."

     "No; it will be very uncomfortable to be in constant dread, never 
knowing
any night I lay down what I may come to before morning; I may lose my life,
and never again see my son."

     "Yes," I replied; "but had we better not put out the lights?"

     "I will order it to be done."

     As he spoke, he rang a bell, and when a servant appeared, he said to
him, --

     "William, you had better put out all lights, and be quite silent; and 
if
you hear any noise, get out of the way, and remain silent, unless they try 
to
get away and elude us."

     "Very well, sir."

     "And as soon as you hear them at work, you had better steal up and let 
me
know, as I intend to be present when they are taken into custody, as I have 
a
particular desire to see it done."

     "Very well, sir; but you don't know the danger you run.  These men are
desperate men, and they care not what they do."

     "I know all that, William; but hasten down, and see my orders 
executed."

     "Very well, sir," said the servant, who at once left the room.

     "These people," said my host, "are not willing that I should run any
risk; perhaps they think they will not have so indulgent a master in the 
next. 
Perhaps they are right; for I give but little trouble, and my servants are
mostly out visiting some of their relatives."

     "Indeed.  I thought you were somewhat slenderly attended."

     "I am.  I have two very ill away at this moment, and I have another 
away
on a visit to some relative."

     "Indeed; they have an easy life under you."

     "It is much the same as not having them at all; and yet, I must say, I
have nothing to complain of; my wishes are complied with, and I have all my
work done well, and punctually to a minute; and, if they have extra work to
do, they never complain, but set about it cheerfully."

     At that moment we heard William creeping up the stairs, and my thoughts
soon reverted from the contemplation of the calm contentment in which all 
here
appeared to dwell, to the confusion and bustle that was now likely to ensue.

     "Hilloa, William!"

     "Yes, sir, they are come," said William, in a low voice.

     "Where are they getting in at?"

     "In at the pantry window, sir.  I can hear them unbolting the shutters.
They have cut a hole out of it, and they will be clear in in another 
minute."

     "Very good.  Now do you all keep together, and, at the appointed 
signal,
rush upon them, and bind them hand and foot."

     "It shall be done, sir, as soon as they get into the kitchen."

     "Very well.  I will come down and watch the operations; but don't let
them get back again."

     "Oh, we'll take care of that."

     "Make haste," he said, "and station some of them under the stairs, so
that they cannot escape.  They must both be taken."

     "And they shall."

     "Go one.  Will you come down with me," he said, turning to me, "or will
you remain here till we have secured them?  You, sir, are a stranger, and,
perhaps, you had better remain here."

     "No, not I," said I.  "I will go down with you, by all means, and we 
will
see how these fellows behave themselves under these circumstances.  Let me 
see
them.  I was the first to discover them, and I hope you will not refuse me
permission to be present at a _denouement_ which I have, in some measure, 
been
instrumental in bringing about.  I wish to be present."

     "Then follow me," said my host; "we shall not be too soon, for several
minutes have elapsed."

     I waited not a moment, but hurried down stairs, and found that, as I 
was
going down the kitchen stairs, the robbers were well aware of the fact that
they were entrapped; and, in their rage, they fought with desperation, and
forced their way out of the kitchen, and through the barrier placed below;
and, seeing they would effect an escape, I jumped over the rails, and stood
between them and the way out.

     I had but my sword, and I drew that, and placed myself in a position,
threatening destruction to the first who should attempt to pass.

     This, however, was disregarded; and the two men rushed at me, hoping to
bear me down, but my weapon ran through the first, when a pistol bullet laid
me low, and the man rushed over me."

     "Good Heavens! and were you shot, Sir Francis?"

     "Oh, yes, and was severely injured; and it was some months before I was
cured, the bullet having wounded an artery."

     "That was dangerous."

     "Yes, so much so, that two surgeons declared that, had I bled another
half-second, I must have been dead-- that I must in fact have bled to death,
and I should never have recovered; for I had, they thought, scarcely half an
ounce of blood in my whole body-- scarcely sufficient to cause the heart to
beat."

     "It was a fearful state-- where did you remain?"

     "I remained at this gentleman's house the whole of the time; he was 
very
liberal, and very generous; I wanted for nothing.  He said that, but for the
immediate attention of the surgeons, he thought I must have bled to death; 
he
saw me fall, and one of the men, without waiting for orders to do so, ran 
for
a surgeon, and hence the rapidity with which the medical man was in
attendance. And, what was worse, I had, in about two months afterwards, to
undergo an operation to have the bullet extracted."

     "Good Heavens! you had a severe time of it?"

     "I had; and I had nearly lost my life a second time, for I lost a vast
quantity of blood again; and, ever since that, I have been of the
extraordinary pale complexion which you now see."

     "I thought it was natural," said Mrs. Fraser, suddenly; but a look from
Mr. Fraser told her she had done wrong.

     "No, ma'am, it is not, indeed, natural."

     "It was not until the loss of blood occasioned it, I presume?"

     "No, captain, it was not; it resulted partly from the dreadful loss of
the vital fluid which I sustained, and partly from a most violent virulent
typhus, which I took in consequence of my looseness of system-- that, I
believe, did more than anything else towards bringing me to my present
positon-- for, before, I was considered fair and florid in complexion, but 
my
friends hardly knew me, or professed they did not, and I have not see them
from that day to this."

     "Upon my word, Sir Francis Varney, you have had some extraordinary
occurrences in your life.  I am amazed at them; indeed I could scarcely
believe one person, especially a gentleman of your propery and standing----"

     "Why, as for that, I can only say that my position and rank here have
given me the means to enable me to go through them without any 
inconvenience,
for I have no home or place dedicated to domestic delights; such a life I
should be proud and happy to possess, but which I can never accomplish;
indeed, I may say, I fear to make the attempt; but, no matter.  The prime of
life will, in a few years, pass away, and then I shall be past the desire 
for
a home; and yet Varney-hall in the north, is an ancient, palace-like abode,
that would grace a duchess."

     "Is that your ancestral hall?"

     "It is," said Varney, with emotion.

     "And now uninhabited?"

     "Oh, dear, no.  When I determined to lead the life I do, I could not
permit the old place to become ruinous and deserted and, therefore, let it,
and those who now live there, are well able and willing to keep the place in
repair."

     "That is fortunate."

     "Well, sir, I hardly know what is fortunate or unfortunate as regards
myself; but I have one of my old fits of melancholy come over me."

     "Nay, you must battle against them, Sir Francis."

     "I have ever endeavoured to do so, but I don't know how it is-- I 
cannot,
somehow or other, bear up-- I feel a terrible depression of spirits."

     "I am truly sorry to hear it; but let us hope that the gaieties of Bath
will restore you to your wonted serenity."

     "I am sure I wish it," said Mrs. Fraser; "but where are we to go
to-morrow? -- can you tell me that, Sir Francis?"

     "To the pump-room in the morning-- the library and the assembly in the
evening, if you are inclined to do all at once."

     "Yes; well, then, suppose we make the attempt; we can but give in if we
find it too much exertion, though I am inclined to believe we shall not find
it beyond our strength," said Mrs. Fraser.

     "Then that is our agreement," said Sir Francis.

     "Yes; it is."

 Next Time: The Scene of the Murder. -- The Visit to the House. -- The
 Mysterious Disappearance of the Treasure.




                            CHAPTER CXLIII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 152]

THE SCENE OF THE MURDER. -- THE VISIT TO THE HOUSE. -- THE MYSTERIOUS
DISAPPEARANCE OF THE TREASURE.


     The next day came; there was much excitement in the family of the
Frasers; each one could see the partiality of Sir Francis Varney for Miss
Stevens.  She herself could not pretend that it was not so, or that she was
unable to see it.  It was quite plain and evident, and yet it gave her great
pain, because she had an unconquerable aversion to him, who was her
benefactor, and to whom she owed so much.

     This, however, was a strong and inexplicable feeling in her own mind, 
and
she felt that if death or Sir Francis were her only alternatives, she must
choose the former.  This was from some feeling, from what source it sprung 
she
could not tell you, that appeared to forbid her permitting the approach of
such a lover.

     It might have been instinct, or it might have been that she had taken a
personal dislike to him on account of his complexion; and yet she could not
admit so much even to herself as that, and yet it must have had an origin.

     She looked at him much more and more each hour, and more and more did 
she
dislike him.  At length she felt so much repugnance to him, that, if it were
not for the deep gratitude she owed him, she would fly from and not even
endure his society, good as that she was compelled to admit really was.

     When he offered her his arm in their walk to the assembly-rooms and the
pump-room, they were much pleased with the appearance of everything, and 
with
the attentions of Sir Francis, who certainly did all he could to make the
party comfortable and amused, he was so well acquainted with every object.

     As they returned to the hotel, at which they all remained, they passed
the house of the old woman who had been so cruelly murdered the night 
before.
Sir Francis cast a cursory glance at it as they passed, but there was no 
sign
of the door having been opened, and the murder had not yet been discovered;
and this arose from the fact that the old woman was an eccentric, and her
shutters had remained in that way before; and, therefore, no one took any
particular notice of it.

     When the party had reached the hotel, Sir Francis said, --

     "You will, I presume, attend the ball this evening at the
assembly-rooms?"

     "We should wish to do so," replied the captain.  "Do you intend to go,
Sir Francis?"

     "I will, captain.  It is now some time since I went to such a place, 
and
I think the change will be so great and agreeable, that I will go."

     "Then we shall have the advantage of your guidance," said Captain 
Fraser;
"and I hope we shall long have the pleasure of doing so."

     "You are very good in saying so, captain; and, if agreeable to yourself
and the ladies, I am willing, and shall be happy to bear you company."

     "I am sure," replied Mrs. Fraser, "we shall always be happy with Sir
Francis Varney's company, and thank him for his condescension-- shall we 
not,
sister?"

     "Yes.  I am sure I shall be much obliged to Sir Francis for this, as 
well
as many other services he has done us."

     "Do not talk in this manner," sadi Sir Francis, -- "do not speak of the
past, Miss Stevens; it is the present I would wish you to think of; at the
same time, I desire only to be accepted, because I may not be thought
intruding."

     "Dear me, Sir Francis, how you talk!  Really, I am afraid we have said
something to give you displeasure, or my sister, here, has misbehaved 
herself;
if so, I shall really take her to task for so doing."

     "You will be acting unjustly if you do.  But permit me to leave you for 
a
short time.  I have some matters to transact.  I expect a remittance of 
money
to this place, for I usually appoint some particular town or city, for I do
not consider it safe to carry any great amount of money about me; it gives
such temptations to robbery and violence that, travelling as I do, from 
place
to place, I am especially liable to such attempts."

     "Certainly, you are."

     "Then I will bid you good evening, for the present," said the baronet,
and he left the room.

         *             *             *             *             *

     When Sir Francis left the apartment in which he had been with the
Frasers, he walked to his own apartment, and taking a large cloak and a 
small
portmanteau he had purchased, he made his way to the very house where he had
the night before committed such a double murder.

     Before he reached there, however, he put the cloak on, and when he
approached the house, he found the street entirely deserted; then hastilly
stepping up, he put the key into the key-hole, and at once opened the door 
and
walked in.

     He paused a moment or two, and then went down the passage a few feet,
until he came to the body, for which he felt with his foot.

     "Ah!" he muttered; "I see all is right-- quite right; here is the body-
-
nobody has been here to disturb it."

     He took out materials for obtaining a light, and then he pushed past, 
and
walked up stairs, until he came to the bed-room, where he again opened the
strange receptacle of gold and bones; but, as he did so, what was his
amazement to find a small packet of paper lying down, but all the gold gone!

     He started up in an instant, and laid his hand upon his sword, but at 
the
same time he appeared rivetted to the spot, and paused in this attitude for
more than a minute.

     Then, recovering himself, he gazed round slowly and carefully from side
to side, as if to assure himself he was not trapped.  But hearing no sound -
-
nothing stirring from any quarter whatever, he began to think there might be
some mistake in his vision.

     "Surely-- surely," he muttered, "no one could have come in, and, seeing
the bodies, possessed themselves of the money, and then walked out.  They
would surely have given the alarm; besides, any one who had entered would
never have gone further than the bodies.

     "It is impossible," he muttered, and he again stooped down to examine 
the
cupboard from which the treasure appeared to be abstracted.  But there was
nothing to be seen, save the bare boards; no signs of the treasure remained.
This was a strange and mysterious disappearance of what could not have gone
without human means.

     "How did they get at it?" he muttered; "the place was locked, and in 
the
same order as I left it; there is no getting into such a place without
unlocking or forcing open the cupboard, or, I may say, chest, for this is a
stong place; it is not broken open, and I have the key."

     Varney paused for several moments, and then he picked up some paper,
which was folded up, and seeing it was written upon, he thrust it into his
pocket, and again looked into the treasure coffer, but all was gone.

     "D---n!" muttered Varney, furiously stamping his foot, as if at that
moment only he had become perfectly aware of his disappointment.  "What can 
be
the meaning of this?  But this is no place for me; some one has been here, 
and
the murder is known.  I must quit it-- eh?"

     At that moment there came such a peal at the door with the knocker, 
that
made the house appear as if it were a pandemonium of noises and echoes, 
which
followed the first stunning sounds that filled the place.

     Varney started and listened.

     "Ah," he said, "they have tracked me here.  What can that mean?  Have
they, indeed, laid a trap for me?  Do they think I am caught?  But, no-- no, 
I
am too fast; they know me not, nor can any one have traced me here, for they
know not where I came from, and-- but there, it is useless speculating; they
may have laid a trap to catch whom they could, or they-- ah, they have seen
the light, and the house being shut all day, they now want to see if 
anything
is the matter; but I'll warrant all is safe and clear; there is nothing 
known,
and all I have to do, is to get away."

     That was very true; all Sir Francis had to do was to get away; but it 
was
somewhat more difficult to perform than he had any notion; for, as he came 
out
into the landing, he found there was an unexpected obstacle in his path.  As
soon as he attempted to descend to the back parlour for the purpose of 
getting
out of the back window, he found the door had been burst open by the
impatience of the mob who stood below, and the door not being very strong, 
the
shoulders of those who were nearest were sufficient to force it open.

     In a moment the passage was filled with the crowd, the foremost of whom
tumbled over the body, and were up in a moment.

     "Good God!" exclaimed one, "here is somebody lying down in the 
passage."

     "It is a corpse," said another.

     "The woman's murdered," said another, "Get a light-- get a light, and 
let
us see what is the matter.  Here is a dead body-- a light-- get a light, 
can't
some of you?"

     "Well, I suppose we can; but what of it?  I expect it can't be done
without giving anybody time to do it in; if you think it can, you had better
do it yourself, and perhaps you'll begin now."

     However, there was a light produced, and that put an end to the
altercation, and silence was immediately restored, when they saw the 
congealed
blood, and the body lying in it; and then one, on pushing his way into the
parlour, exclaimed, --

     "And here's the old woman, she's dead and cold."

     "She's murdered!"

     "Yes, there's no doubt about that, poor creatures; and no one at hand 
to
lend them any assistance.  What a horrible affair!"

     "Yes, horrible; but who's done it?  There are rooms up stairs; they had
better be searched; let's go up at once."

     "Aye-- aye."

     Sir Francis waited not a moment more; he had heard enough to convince 
him
his only chance was to escape while he could, for if they once seized him
under such circumstances, he would not be able to escape again, and he
immediately rushed to the back window; but there was no balcony there; he
could not get out there, so came to the landing, and just reached the short
steps that led to the roof, and there, had scarcely got the trap-door
unbolted, when the heard a voice say, --

     "Up stairs, lad-- up stairs.  I hear somebody there trying to get out--
up stairs, lads, and follow him-- up stairs."

     There was a shout, and then all rushed up stairs, and Varney had 
scarcely
got into the loft, when some one called out, --

     "I see his legs-- he's got into the loft.  Up the steps."

     "Hurrah! hurrah! up the steps, my boys; follow me," sadi one man, as he
got on the landing, and ran to seize the ladder; but Varney saw the 
necessity
of preventing immediate and hot pursuit, lest he should be recognised and
followed to the hotel, when that would be death to his hopes.

     Just as the man had reached the ladder, Varney lifted it off the hooks
upon which it hung, and flung it back against the man, who fell back, and 
he,
with the fallen ladder, created a dreadful confusion amongst those who were
coming up stairs, many being knocked down, and the remainder retreated,
thinking that at least there were a battalion of murderers.

     This gave Varney time to get to the roof, and he then crept along 
several
house-tops, without being discovered, though he could hear the shouts and 
hum
of the mob, as they gathered round the house he had left.

     Then how to get out of his present position was a question he was not
well able to tell.  He must let himself out through some of the houses, and 
to
do that without raising a hue-and-cry, was a question he was not able to
solve.  Once or twice he thought of letting himself down from the outside; 
but
this he gave up as being impossible, for destruction to himself would be the
instant result.

     "I must get into one of these houses, and remain concealed," he 
thought,
"till the dead of the night, and then I could get through the house without
any trouble, or fear of detection-- but then the Frasers.  I must not
disappoint them."

     This last consideration appeared to determine him, for he immediately
crawled to one house that appeared to be the best calculated for his 
purpose,
and he at once entered it by means of a small window that belonged to an
attic.  In this room was to be seen only a bed, and a few chairs, and a 
table.

     All was silent, no one was moving; he stepped up to the bed, but was
somewhat startled to find it occupied by some odd-looking human form, 
wrapped
up in a curious and uninviting manner.

     "Ah!" thought Varney, "I didn't think to have found any one in 
possession
of this place so early; but they sleep, and that is enough."

     He had scarce said so, when a voice said,

     "Nurse, nurse-- confound you, why don't you bring my posset?  Do you
hear, cuss you? here have I been kept here for two hours without my supper,
and what you gave me last night had no rum in it.  How's a man to get well,
and kept upon short allowance?  I tell you it cannot be done, not at any
price.  Will you bring me my grog posset, or won't you?  You inhuman wretch,
to keep an old sailor upon short allowance of grog and won't give him any
except in the shape of a posset!"

     This was pathetic, but Varney paid no attention to it, and gently 
glided
out of the room.  When he quitted the apartment, he descended the stairs, 
and
then he came to the passage or hall, when he was met by a stout female.

     "Whom do you want?" exclaimed the fat female.

     "Madam," said Varney, "are you aware of the calamity that has befallen
you?"

     "No, sir.  What-- what is it?"

     "The lunatic in the top room has in a fit of malignity set the upper 
part
of your house in flames.  You had better take care of yourself."

     "Oh, my God! the house is on fire!" said the fat woman.  "Oh, mercy,
mercy!  Fire! fire! fire!  The house is a fire."

     Varney turned round and opened the door, just as several people were
rushing out of their rooms at hearing these alarming exclamations.

     "That will do," muttered Varney, as he closed the door behind him, and
then walked hastily towards the hotel, to which, however, he did not go 
quite
straight; he went a little on one side to avoid meeting the crowd, as being 
an
unpleasant mass of human creatures which are singularly unpleasant to meet
with, leaving them to secure themsleves and find the murderer, if they were
able to do so.

 Next Time: The Assembly. -- Sir Francis's First Overtures to Mary Stevens. 
--
 The Breakfast Scene. -- And the Honour Declined.




                            CHAPTER CXLIV. [sic]

                               [Chapter 153]

THE ASSEMBLY. -- SIR FRANCIS'S FIRST OVERTURES TO MARY STEVENS. -- THE
BREAKFAST SCENE. -- AND THE HONOUR DECLINED.


     Sir Francis Varney, as soon as he reached his hotel, changed his
habiliments, and sought the Frasers, whom he found ready for the assembly,
and somewhat fearful he was not coming; but he easily excused himself on the
score of illness, and then they persuaded him to remain at their abode, and
they would all do so too; but at the same time Sir Francis insisted that his
indisposition was but temporary, and he would rather visit the place, as it
was a ball night.

     Thus persuaded, they agreed, and the five of them proceeded to the
assembly rooms, where they amused themselves as fashionable people usually 
do.
They danced, and were highly delighted with the place, which was certainly 
of
a very superior description, contained the very _elite_ of the Bath 
visitors,
and appealed to advantage.

     The wealth and beauty to be found in the room would have caused many a
heart to bound with rapture, whether it was the miser's or the lover's; for
both could there find that which gladdened them most, gold and beauty --
wealth and youth; each could gloat his eyes on that he held dearest.

     "Did you ever witness a scene like this?" said Sir Francis Varney, as 
he
led Miss Stevens to a seat, and handed her refreshments.  "Did you ever 
behold
one in which was collected so much beauty and youth?"

     "There are many happy faces," said Mary Stevens.

     "And hearts, too, I hope," said Varney.

     "I hope so, too," replied Mary.

     "There are several here who have never been to a ball before; 'tis 
their
_debut_ in life, and a fine and lovely commencement it is; and if all their
future years should be such a round of pleasure and gaiety as this, they 
needs
must be happy."

     "I am sure they must.  People here seem to wish to make each other
happy."

     "And if they strive in heart, they must succeed in doing so, and in
making themselves happy too."

     "No doubt they do."

     "And you, Miss Stevens, would you not make yourself happy when you make
others happy?" inquired Sir Francis Varney.

     "I certainly do feel happy when I am an instrument in the hands of
another doing good, and seeing it really gives others happiness."

     "That is one of the noblest ends of life."

     "And one which you, Sir Francis, have pursued to some purpose.  You 
ought
to be happy, if any man can claim happiness."

     "I am, in one respect; but when there is a great void in life, which 
has
to be filled-- when that void is in the affections, can it be surprising 
that
sorrow and grief are there?"

     "I cannot give you an answer, because I have no knowledge of such an
existence; had I, it would be otherwise; but I cannot say yea, or nay."

     "Well," said Sir Francis, "it is so; that void is in my heart; and,
before I saw you, I felt it not; but now," he paused, "but now I feel it--
feel it deeply, and I shall ever do so unless-- but I hardly dare say more--
my heart will never again know sorrow, and never again feel tranquil.  Wants
and wishes have sprung up which, until now, have never presented themselves
in the shape of possibilities, much less probabilities, and which now are
realities."

     "This is a strange conversation, Sir Francis."

     "It is, Miss Stevens, and I feel it to be so; but, unfortunately, I 
have
a certain difficulty to overcome, which, perhaps, accident, more than 
courage,
wiil enable me to break through.  But, to speak plainly, before I saw you, 
the
whole world was alike to me; I cared not for one more than another; but, now
the world has new charms, I have new hopes and wishes.  God knows if they 
are
to be dissipated, like the morning mist before the glories of the rising 
sun.
Love has made sad havoc in my heart; and to love and despair is the 
bitterest
lot humanity can fall into.  Man can bear all that adverse fate may entail
upon him; but that saps at the foundation of the superstructure, our love of
life, without which, society could not hold together; and, with disappointed
love, there is no love of existence."

     "Indeed, Sir Francis, I regret to hear it."

     "Will you prevent it?"

     "I cannot now answer you any such question, if I were inclined to do 
so--
I have not the power.  See, Sir Francis, there is another set."

     "Will you dance?"

     "No; I do not think I will dance any more to-night; but I shall be glad
to rejoin my sister and brother."

     "I will lead you to them, with pleasure; but will you allow me to name
this matter to Captain Fraser?"

     "I have no right to dictate to you, Sir Francis," said Mary, with 
evident
embarrassment, "much less would I do so, or endeavour to do so to one to 
whom
I owe so much; and yet I fear it will be fruitless."

     "There, yonder, are your friends."

     As Sir Francis spoke, he pointed to another end of the room, to which 
he
was leading her, and which was occupied by many of the most fashionable and
beautiful; they also had to pass down a lane of fashionables who were
occupying seats, having been fatigued by dancing-- many not having danced at
all, but come to keep watchful and Argus eyes upon the sons and daughters 
whom
they brought with them.

     These, at least, noticed them-- all eyes were fixed upon them, and Sir
Francis, certainly with an air of triumph, led the beautiful Mary Stevens
towards her friends, who were gazing at them with attention.

     Mary thought herself somewhat awkwardly situatied, and knew not how to
release herself; and also felt that any attempt of the kind would really be 
as
ungracious as it would be ungrateful, and so resigned herself.

     A few yards more, and then she was once again in the company of her
friends, but not released from Sir Francis, for he seated himself by her 
side
with the ease of one who was well accustomed to their society, and of those
around him.

     "Well, Sir Francis," said Mrs. Fraser, "you have not been unnoticed in
the ball-room.  You have created quite a sensation; your dancing is 
superior,
and your tall figure has set you off."

     "You mistake, Mrs. Fraser; the object of such general attention was no
other than your beautiful sister-- my fair partner."

     "Don't make her vain."

     "That, indeed, would be a misfortune; but she has such an excellent
capacity of mind, that she runs no danger of such a misfortune; but even 
were
it not so, there would be much excuse."

     "You are flattering, Sir Francis."

     "Not I, I assure you.  How do you find yourself?"

     "I am getting fatigued.  My recent journeys must plead an excuse for my
weariness at such a time and in such a place as this."

     "I am not suprised at this, considering how you have been riding about
for many days past.  Would you choose to retire to-night, and remain later 
on
another occasion?"

     "I think," said Captain Fraser, "it may be as well.  What do you say, 
my
dear?"

     "I am quite willing."

     "And so am I," said Mary.  "Indeed I would much sooner we left early-- 
if
midnight can be called early."

     "It is much past that hour now."

     "Then I think we are decided upon going."

     "Very well," said Sir Francis; "then I will obtain a carriage for our
use, and then we shall retire to our homes."

     "If you please, Sir Francis."

     Varney then rose, and went out for the purpose of procuring what was
wanted, and, by the aid of a little silver, he soon obtained what he 
desired,
and then returned to inform his friends of the success of his mission.

     They then left the ball-room, and proceeded at once to enter the
carriage, which was so placed that they could at once enter without any
inconvenience; and they soon gained their hotel, and, after a slight repast,
they separated.

     It was late next moring when Sir Francis Varney entered the room in 
which
he usually took breakfast with the Frasers; but, though late, he only met
Captain Fraser.

     "I am afraid, Captain Fraser," said Varney, "I have kept you all.
Perhaps the ladies are gone out?"

     "No, no; they have not yet come down.  Indeed, had you been in five
minutes earlier than this, you would not have found me here."

     "Well, I know not the reason, but I slept well myself.  To be sure," 
said
Sir Francis, "I did not fall readily to sleep, and that may account for it."

     "Indeed! and do you not sleep sound?"

     "Usually-- I may say, generally; but sometimes some reflections keep 
the
mind actively employed against one's own wishes."

     "They do so, Sir Francis.  I have myself found that to be the case; but 
I
am sorry my female folks do not come down."

     "Nay, nay, Captain Fraser, do no wish that on my account.  I am rather
pleased they are not down than otherwise."

     "Indeed, Sir Francis!"

     "Yes," replied Sir Francis, " as it leaves me an opportunity of saying 
a
few words to you, Captain Fraser, upon a subject that concerns myself nearly
and deeply."

     "You amaze me, Sir Francis."

     "I had hoped you might have had some guess at it, Captain Fraser, as it
would have helped me through my task; for my heart almost fails me when I
think of the possibility of want of success-- my want of nerve is not
habitual."

     "I can depose to so much, Sir Francis; you showed courage, and nerve,
where courage and nerve were most wanted."

     "Ah, well, Captain Fraser, If I had been brought up to your noble
profession, I should have been better able to make an impression; but I will
do my best; but the subject is a grave one, as it relates to my feelings
toward your sister-in-law, Miss Mary Stevens."

     "Indeed, Sir Francis!"

     "Yes, Captain Fraser.  I, who have passed through so many ordeals of
beauty, have at last been compelled to bow before the shrine of beauty.  I 
am
a devoted and humble admirer of Miss Stevens's charms and virtues."

     "Well, Sir Francis?"

     "I now beg your permission to visit her, and be accepted in your family
in the character of one who ardently wishes and desires to become a member 
of
it by means of an union between myself and that young lady."

     "Personally, Sir Francis, I have the greatest pleasure in hearing you 
say
so much."

     "Then I am likely to be fortunate."

     "So far as my approbation, and my consent are concerned, Sir Francis, 
you
certainly are successful; but, according to the vulgar proverb, as one 
swallow
makes no summer, so one individual's consent is not decisive where two are
required to concur."

     "Certainly, Captain Fraser.  I was not wishing to put the young lady
aside; but having your consent, I may go on to endeavour to obtain the
happiness I so much look foward to-- but I may count upon your good 
offices?"

     "You may, most certainly."

     "And your amiable lady?"

     "Yes, I think I may say she will unite with me in using all due means 
of
aiding you in your wishes-- but here she is."

     At that moment, Mrs. Fraser entered the apartment, and advancing to Sir
Francis, offering him her hand and saying, --

     "Sir Francis, how do you do this morning?  I am afraid I have kept you-
-
ah, I see you are alone with Captain Fraser-- where is my sister?"

     "Mary has not yet come down," said Fraser.

     "Ah, we are both late, I think."

     "I am, madam; but you have come at a right moment."

     "Have I?  Why do you reckon it so?"

     "Because I was just at that moment speaking of you, and here you are; 
so
that I can speak to you, which is much better."

     "Well, so it is-- but what is it about?"

     "You amiable and lovely sister."

     "Ah, that is what you men always say-- it is just what Captain Fraser
said to me."

     "Then may I hope for a like success?"

     "I don't understand," said Mrs. Fraser, doubtfully."

     "Why, I was saying to Captain Fraser, if he could obtain your aid in my
behalf in an attack upon your sister's heart.  I have been unable to hold 
out
any longer-- I am deeply and desperately in love."

     "Well, that is a very dangerous disorder, and I must see what Mary can 
do
to console you in your affliction."

     "You will indeed deserve my best thanks if you will do so; and, should
success crown our efforts, how deep a debt of gratitude will mine be to 
you."

     "How much are we not yours already?"

     "But my whole happiness will be through your efforts."

     "Oh, no, no; remember, you said but just now it was my sister you meant
to wed, and not me."

     "Good God! how could you imagine I had any such profane thought?"

     "Ha! ha! Sir Francis, I must see what I can do with Mary; but, she
comes-- another of the _dramatis personae_."

     Mary Stevens at that moment entered the room, and felt most abashed at
finding all eyes rivetted upon her without speaking, and she advanced 
towards
the fire, having made an inclination to Sir Francis, saying, as she came 
down,
--

     "I fear I have been the means of keeping you waiting.  I am sorry you 
did
so; but I was really not aware of the hour."

     "Nor were we," said Mrs. Fraser; "and it appears we have all been late,
save Sir Francis, who, like a true knight, has been at his post, I don't 
know
how long before I came down myself."

     "Nay, don't you listen to any charges, Miss Stevens.  I have been here
but a very short time, though I ought to have been here earlier."

     "It is fortunate then you did, Sir Francis, and I am relieved of the
charge of detaining breakfast to an unusual hour."

     "It matters but little when it is had, so long as it is to be had when 
it
is wanted.  What say you, Sir Francis?"

     "I believe that the grand object of all our wishes and wants, is to 
have
what we want when we want it.  An eastern potentate could not be better
served, or more powerful, or richer, than to be able to say so much."

     "You are his equal."

     "I am in some things certainly," replied Sir Francis; "but I want an
empress, and thus, you see, I am dethroned and rendered powerless by a few
words."

     "You can obtain even that."

     "Not exactly; for she whom I might choose might refuse to become mine;
then, I am a weary wanderer upon earth's surface-- I am no longer one among
men; but a mere existence, moving about without filling any allotted
position."

     "This is very doleful, Sir Francis," said Mary; "if you say much more,
you will spoil your appetite for breakfast."

     "Mary, that is a cruel cut, you did not mean it, I dare say; but it is 
a
sufficient rebuke.  I must come to plain speaking, and at once hope you
recollect the subject upon which I spoke to you in the ballroom last night."

     "I do, Sir Francis; it would be affectation to say I did not."

     "Well, I have sought Captain and Mrs. Fraser's permission to endeavour 
to
win those smiles and good wishes, that I so much desire should be mine."

     "You can never deserve less than good wishes from me," said Mary 
Stevens;
"you cannot have less, I am too deeply indebted----"

     "There, now, pray permit me to interrupt you.  I must not hear any more
of that; I did my duty on that occasion----"

     "Occasions!"

     "Well, occasions; and I hope no gentleman, having the power, would have
done otherwise; and if so, I have only done what others would have done 
under
the same circumstances-- a very ordinary act indeed."

     "You are making less of it than it deserves, were it only for our 
sakes."

     "I see you won't entertain my wishes seriously; but, recollect, what is
sport to you is death to me-- the affections of a blighted heart cannot 
weigh
lightly when the evil is consummated."

     "Do not think, Sir Francis, I wish to evade or to slight any wishes you
may form; as far as I am concerned, they are a great honour to me; but I am
yet too young, and averse to anything of the kind yet to feel justified in
seriously entertaining such matters as those you allude to."

     "That, indeed, must be a mistake; you are not too young.  Let me hope
that you will not refuse to allow me the satisfaction and pleasure of your
company; that would indeed be a greater misfortune than could otherwise 
happen
to me to be deprived suddenly of that, I assure you."

     "Certainly I cannot feel otherwise than gratitude to you, Sir Francis,
and derive that pleasure in your society which others feel, and which all 
your
friends must experience; but we will say no more upon this subject, except
that I have given as serious and positive an answer as I can."

     There were many other observations made during breakfast-time to much 
the
same effect, but it is unnecessary to record them, and the breakfast passed
off as pleasantly as possible, under the circumstances.

 Next Time: The Two Sisters. -- Mary Stevens's Dislike of Sir Francis 
Varney.
 -- An Useless Suit. -- Disunion.




                             CHAPTER CXLV. [sic]

                               [Chapter 154]

THE TWO SISTERS. -- MARY STEVENS'S DISLIKE OF SIR FRANCIS VARNEY. -- AN
USELESS SUIT. -- DISUNION.


     There was much stir in Bath next day on account of the murder that had
occurred, and everybody spoke of it.  The papers were filled with it, and it
was thought to have been the most barbarous murder that had ever been
committed, and most active exertions were being made to discover the
perpetrators of this horrid deed.  All sorts of conjectures were being made 
as
to who the murderer might be, and his object in becoming one.  Gold, of
course, was assigned as that.

     There was something terrible in the fact that this should have occurred
just as the Frasers had arrived in Bath -- it was startling, they thought,
though they could of course have no connexion with it whatever.

     While the examinations were being proceeded with, Sir Francis Varney
appeared out in the streets as seldom as possible; not that he had any fear 
of
recognition, for that was impossible; but, at the same time, he would not 
run
unnecessary risk, while so much was to be won.

     The days passed, and many very pleasant hours were spent, and the
gaieties of Bath were enjoyed to their fullest; while Sir Francis was their
great friend everywhere, for, somehow or other, Sir Francis obtained the
precedence go where he would, and they shared it with him.

     He pressed his suit with much ardour, and Mary Stevens appeared each 
day
less and less inclined to accept of Sir Francis Varney for a lover.  She 
felt
a greater and greater repugnance to Sir Francis, who, however, pressed her
more hardly and more assiduously than ever.

     However, Captain Fraser and his lady were sensible of the advantages of
such a match to themselves and to Mary, for they could not believe that one 
so
courteous and brave could do otherwise than make any lady happy; the first
objection would wear away in the person of such a man as Varney; they
therefore espoused his cause warmly when they found that Mary was averse to
the match.

     "What can be you objection, Mary?" inquired Mrs. Fraser.

     "I cannot tell."

     "Surely it cannot be an insurmountable objection," said Captain Fraser,
"since you do not know what it consists of.  You cannot have a very definite
idea; and possibly a little explanation may set the matter to rights."

     "I know well enough what it means."

     "Do you, dear?  Why not tell us?"

     "I will.  It consists of a strong dislike to Sir Francis.  I cannot 
tell
you why; but it is a very strong and yet distinct feeling."

     "What can it arise from?"

     "That I cannot explain."

     "If you could, we should be able to come to some conclusion respecting
it; but at present it appears like a blind, causeless antipathy, and, 
against
one so well calculated to make any feamle happy as Sir Francis Varney, is so
extraordinary that it really exceeds belief.  I cannot express my regret and
astonishment."

     "I cannot understand it."

     "I am sorry for it."

     "And more like ingratitude, Mary, than I though you capable of.  There
are two occasions upon which you stand indebted to him for your life.  He
risked his own greatly on the last occasion."

     "I am truly sorry it should happen so, sister."

     "Well, then, Mary, amend the error; for if it were an ordinary affair,
common dislike might pass very well; but towards such a man as Sir Francis
Varney it is decidedly wrong.  Indeed, when I recollect the horrors of that
night-- when I remember the flames and smoke, and saw you wrapped up safely
from the effects of the fire, while he was exposed to every breath of hot
air----"

     "Hush!  I recollect it all; but it makes me shudder."

     "Can you, then, regard such a man with cold dislike?  Upon my word, I 
am
shocked at your baseness."

     "Sister, sister, you are too severe-- too severe."

     "Only just, Mary-- only just."

     "More than just.  Do not turn persecutor."

     "I would not; but this conduct of yours make me feel strongly-- very
strongly, and I can hardly face Sir Francis Varney and tell him that one who
belongs to me can treat him in such a manner."

     "Does love always spring from gratitude?"

     "It is useless to ask such questions, Mary, or I might retort by asking
if such services as his always produced dislike.  But Sir Francis is no
ordinary man.  Suppose you do not love him, which might be explicable; but
then you have no other love; you are fancy free, are you not?"

     "Yes, yes."

     "Well, then, you have no motive for dislike, though you might be
indifferent.  In such a case, I should not have thought it possible that 
there
could have been less than gratitude, and the warmest esteem for his services
and his own good qualities; for he has as good qualities as a man can have."

     "Yes, sister; but that dreadful night has left such an impression upon 
my
mind, that I cannot, dearest, do what you desire-- I mean I cannot love Sir
Francis Varney."

     "What! not love him because of the remembrance of his services?"

     "You quite misunderstood my feelings upon that occasion.  I can never
feel grateful enough for the rescue from the horrible monster who attacked 
me
while I slept at the inn.  I can never forget that moment of horror and
terror.  I cannot even to this day make out the object of the intruder.  It
was not robbery, and it could not have ben any ordinary attack, for it was 
not
carried on in the usual manner.  To seize any one by the arm, and suck the
blood from their veins, appears to me to be a proceeding quite unaccountable
in the ordinary course of things."

     "It was very strange."

     "Yes; and, stranger than all, it has given me a perfect horror of man 
in
general.  I cannot abide the thought of being married at all; indeed, I 
won't,
and I hope that is enough."

     "Upon my word, my good sister," said Captain Fraser, half angry and 
half
jestingly, "you would almost make me believe you were desirous of taking
the veil; but you cannot have any reason for taking such a strong antipathy 
to
male creatures.  You must know very well that, because you have got a fright
in a country inn, that all the abodes of men in the world are not filled 
with
goblins, spirits, and the like, and wicked ogres, who are only waiting to 
eat
up young maidens."

     "It was no jesting matter to me."

     "I do not say but what it was a frightful reality; but, at the same 
time,
such terrible occurrences as these cannot be supposed to happen every day in
one's life; indeed, one in a long life would be a terrible frequency which 
is
never known, and I think you might dismiss the subject from your mind, as an
inexplicable event, unpleasant and unprofitable to recall."

     "But it has been too terrible and too mysterious for me to ever forget;
and, least of all, could I do it in so short a time."

     "Well, I do not expect you could forget it immediately; but, at the 
same
time, I cannot see how it could affect your opinion of your preserver.
Indeed, it is a strnage perversion of intellect, not to say a degree of
ingratitude, that it is difficult, if not impossible, to understand or
believe."

     "Well, I can say no more," said Mary.

     "Thta is very resigned and easy on your part; but what we are to say to
Sir Francis Varney I am sure I cannot tell.  It appears to me that you have 
a
childish dislike to him-- one for which you can allege no reason, and,
therefore, improper.  I wonder what he, or any impartial person, could think
of it, if they had all fully and carefully explained to them."

     "I am sure I do not know; but it is usually sufficient, in a case of 
this
kind, to say one cannot love the party, and to escape from what becomes an
infliction, or, in time, a persecution."

     "But this is not such a case as you would appear to imagine.  There is 
no
persecution, and Sir Francis only desires that you will permit him to 
attempt
tot obtain your good will."

     "But knowing he cannot obtain that-- speaking in the light you mean-- 
it
becomes a serious annoyance to me to think I should always be attended by a
person who, on the score of having done me some services, expects me to 
listen
to his addresses, and to accept him as a lover.  It is becoming a slave,
indeed, when one must not exercise one's discretion in a matter that so 
nearly
concerns the happiness of my future life."

     "You are making mountains out of mole-hills, Mary."

     "I have not taken the same view of this matter that you have," replied
Miss Stevens, "and therefore you quarrel with me.  I think that a great deal
too bad; I did not believe you would have quarrelled with me upon such a
subject-- one that concerns me so much, too, as this."

     "Exactly; it does concern you, and it concerns us also, and that is the
reason why we feel warmly upon the subject.  Your want of motive is so
apparent that it quite concerns us-- we are completely staggered.  What it 
can
all end in I am sure I cannot tell; but Sir Francis must think us an
ungrateful set, or at, least, he must believe you are actuated by the worst
and most ungracious caprice, and capable of great ingratitude."

     "I am sorry for it; but for all that, I cannot consent to marry Sir
Frnacis Varney.  I know not why, but I do."

     "You really ought to be ashamed of such an admission, for I am sure he
does not deserve such treatment."

     "I am compelled to admit that to be true."

     "Then why, in the name of Heaven, should you let prejudice surmount
reason-- and reason that you acknowledge ought to be paramount?  You know 
your
folly, and yet you persist in it.  Was there ever such folly?  Come, Mary,
come, you must give up this kind of nonsense; you must act as I have always
believed you would; you must meet Sir Francis in a proper spirit, and the
result will no doubt be that you will banish all these idle fancies."

     "I should be glad to do so, for they make me very unhappy."

     "Well, well, they are calculated to do so, and when you have cast them
aside, your own happiness and that of your friends will be much increased."

          *             *             *             *             *

     There was much stir in Bath on account of the murder, and the papers 
were
filled with terrific descriptions of the scene, which some even went to the
trouble and expense of producing sketches of, which, what with being badly
drawn, badly copied, blotted, and printed, and being as unlike the original 
as
possible, gave the inhabitants and strangers not a very vivid idea of the
place.

     When, however, the details were adverted to they were terrible enough;
and when Sir Francis Varney entered the apartment in which he usually dined,
he found his friends were full of the discussion.

     "Have you seen anything of the murder, Sir Francis?"

     "No, sir," replied Sir Francis.

     "Well, there is a dreadful affair happened.  How horrible to think-- 
they
might not have been discovered at all, but for the neighbours breaking the
doors in."

     "What is it all about, captain?"

     "Why, two old women were murdered a few nights ago, and they have but
just been discovered; the papers are full of it."

     "What, the murderers?  Well, that was a quick discovery."

     "No, no; I mean it was not discovered at all, as it is supposed, till 
at
least four-and-twenty hours after the deed."

     "Dear me; how was that?"

     "I cannot tell, except the old woman was an eccentric, and her shutters
had been closed before for a whole day; but there were no other signs of 
life
about the house the whole day, which alarmed the neighbours much, and they
began to take precautions towards the evening to force the door, when a 
tall,
peculiar-looking man was observed entering the house by menas of a key."

     "They observed that, did they?"

     "Yes; he was seen quite plain."

     "It will be fortunate, if he should have been the murderer, because 
they
can identify him."

     "Undoubtedly they can."

     "I am glad of it," said Varney.

     "Well; he was seen to go in, and then to go over the house, because 
there
was a light seen to travel up stairs, and stop there some time; and then 
they
knocked for admission, but not being answered, they at once forced open the
door, and they all rushed in, but were horrified to find themselves tumbling
over the dead bodies of the old woman who kept the house, and her servant."

     "Ah! it must have been a startling thing, certainly."

     "Well; they stopped a moment or two-- as was most probable at such a
sight-- and then they ran up stairs, believing the murderer was there."

     "And was he there?"

     "He must have been so, because they heard him get up to the roof, and
they followed, but were baffled, because he threw the ladder down, which
caused them some confusion, and during that the murderer contrived to 
escape."

     "Well; it was quite a field of adventure; but it is to be lamented," 
said
Varney, "they were not successful in their endeavours to catch the murderer;
but what is the alleged motive for the deed?"

     "They say that she had some strange fancies, and that, among others, 
she
had all her money in the house-- her capital, upon which she lived, without
any fear of exhausting it.  That was known to some one or other, and got
whispered about, and it is presumed that for this purpose the poor woman was
murdered."

     "How horribly barbarous! but ain't there any suspicion upon any one,
because it is usually the case?"

     "There is, I believe."

     "And upon whom does it fall?"

     "Upon a relation of her own, who has not been seen for some days, and 
who
had been know to have spoken with impatience at the old woman's life, and 
the
mode in which she spent her money."

     "That speaks for itself," said Varney.

     "So it does; but they have not taken him yet."

     "I hope they will, I am sure; because the whole affair is so truly
horrible!"

     "So it is.  Will you go to the theatre to-night; there is no ball-- we
can have an excellent box?"

     "What do you say, my dear?" said Captain Fraser to his lady.

     "I am willing.  Are you agreeable Mary?"

     "Yes; I am quite content with your decision."

     "Then we are all agreed to the proposal.  There will be a celebrated
actress from London there, and I hope we shall find the entertainment well
worthy of our patronage-- indeed, I have little doubt of it."

 Stevens. -- An Evening Party and Conversation.




                            CHAPTER CXLVI. [sic]

                               [Chapter 155]

THE EFFECTS OF PERSEVARANCE. -- SIR FRANCIS VARNEY AND MARY STEVENS. -- AN
EVENING PARTY AND CONVERSATION.


     The evening was spent agreeable enough at the Bath theatre; Sir Francis
Varney having taken the greatest pains to ingratiate himself with Mary 
Stevens
so much and so delicately, that she could not but feel ashamed at her
antipathy towards him, and certainly did all she could to get the better of
it, and succeeded in some measure in doing so.

     They all returned home in very good humour with themselves and
everything.  Captain Fraser and his lady were completely predisposed to look
upon Sir Francis Varney as one of the first men in England for rank and
breeding; even Mary Stevens was compelled to admit she never saw any one 
whose
demeanour was to be more admired more than his.

     The next morning they all assembled at the breakfast-table, and were 
all
full of lively images and thoughts of the preceding evening.

     There was much more of cordiality and intimacy than had been felt among
them before; for Sir Francis Varney's courtliness gave way, and he became
almost as one of the family.  Mary looked upon him with something like 
wonder,
to see how agreeable a man could be whom she disliked.

     One or two days more passed in this manner; and the dislike of Mary
Stevens to Sir Francis, if not less, was at least not so active or violent;
but she received him as an old friend.

     That much emboldened Sir Francis, who again resolved he would speak to
her, and that in the presence of her brother and sister, hoping by such a
proceeding he should be able to overcome her dislike or fears by his own
efforts, aided by Captain and Mrs. Fraser, who would create a diversion in
his favour.

     "I wish not," he said, "to be importunate; but, in a matter that 
concerns
one's future hopes and wishes-- one cannot well slumber over them-- I wish 
to
become one of such a family as that into which I find myself so strangely 
and
accidentally introduced, though I fear I have failed to make myself as
acceptable as I could wish."

     "No one could think Sir Francis Varney otherwise than acceptable," said
Captain Fraser; "your services to us alone would be enough to endow us all
with the most lively gratitude and admiration, were you only to appear 
amongst
us with no other qualification; but you add those which evidently make any
gentleman an ornament to the circle he may grace with his acquaintance and
friendship."

     "You take a favorable view of all that you see, Captain Fraser."

     "No, no; I merely speak what I think upon a subject which I have had, I
may say, some experience.  I have myself had some dealings in the world; my
profession puts me forward, and I may repeat what I said."

     "No, no, I will not suffer you to do that; what I wish to do is, to
impress, if possible, my fair friend here with favourable sentiments towards
myself.  I am not as some of the young men of these times, who win by the
violence of their suit, which they urge with all the haste of violence to
attack and storm the citadel."

     "That is a very good plan, Sir Francis; why don't you yourself pursue
such a system?  It must carry the citadel by assault."

     "No, no," said Mary, "you will not do anything of the kind.  Was that 
the
way in which you yourself acted?  If so, I am sure I pity my sister; for 
what
can she hope for when she was taken in such a violent manner?"

     "Oh, no, no; Fraser was the unfortunate victor, who was taken prisoner 
in
the moment of victory."

     "Yes, that is the fact; I was taken prisoner; but I have since been
appointed governor in the enemy's country."

     "Ha! ha! ha! well, that is a fortunate issue to your adventure.  I 
would
that mine were as fortunate-- I love, and yet fear to say so."

     "Fear never won a fair lady," said Fraser; "so don't be afraid."

     "What does my fair enemy say her?"

     "I have said so much upon the subject, sir, before, that I was in hopes 
I
should not have had any occasion to say more."

     "I am sorry to hear you say so."

     "Why, it is a pity to render a matter that is settled uncertain, 
without
the prospect of anything being gained by it."

     "So it is; but I hope that is not the present case, Miss Stevens.  My
petition, I hope, is not rejected merely because it has suffered so before.  
I
cannot but hope, though despair for ever stare me in the face for it; but
perhaps devotion and heartfelt love may make some impresssion upon you, and
soften the rigours of a heart that cannot, I am sure, feel any pleasure in 
the
distress of another."

     "No, no, Sir Francis; you only do me justice in saying so much.  I can,
indeed, feel no pleasure in such things.  You may rely upon it, gratitude
alone would prompt me to comply with any request you might make at once and
cheerfully; but you must admit that this is a question that alters the
complexion of other matters, and what might be proper under other
circumstances, cannot be expected under this."

     "Nor am I so unreasonable as to expect anything of the kind.  Now, Miss
Stevens, you much mistake Sir Francis Varney if you think him capable of 
such
meanness.  I wish you to act from your own unbiassed judgment, and, however
painful the result, yet I would in silence put up with your decision.  But
still I hope you will not act imperatively-- that you will look upon my suit
with, at least, not a harsh and averse spirit.  Have some compassion upon 
one
who is entirely at your mercy."

     "Come, Mary, do not act unkindly."

     "I-- I do not know what to say.  I-- I cannot give any other answer."

     "Nay, I won't hear of such a thing, Mary," said Mrs. Fraser; "now or
never.  I will not say that you must not be mindful of the past; but you 
were
never ungrateful, that I know.  You cannot be otherwise than happy."

     "You embarrass me."

     "Miss Stevens, let nothing weigh with you, save your own happiness; 
that
is  my object, and my own at the same time."

     "Say yes, Mary."

     "I-- I cannot."

     "Will not!  What objection?  What on earth could you wish for more?"

     "Do not press me."

     "I should be sorry to do so at such a moment, were it decidedly your
desire not to give an answer now; but I do beg you will not let me linger
longer than necessary.  Indeed, I find I cannot exist in your society and be
deprived of the hope that I may call you one day mine own."

     "Do, Mary, say yes-- say yes!"

     "Will Miss Stevens give me leave to suppose that there may be a time 
when
I may be rewared for my patience?  I will not press you for a plain answer
now, but give me some token that I am not to remain unhappy."

     "Come, Mary, come-- Sir Francis gives you every indulgence."

     But Mary was obstinate some time longer, until Sir Francis, in a
transport, pressed her hand, and placed it to his lips; at the same time she
suffered her silence to be construed into a consent to his wishes.

          *             *             *             *             *

     "Well, Sir Francis," said Captain Fraser, "let me congratulate you in
having subdued the enemy, and you, Mary, in having such a conqueror.  I
protest it was a hard fought battle, and one that I could not tell who would
prove trumphant."

     "I feel well assured you may congratulate me, Captain Fraser.  I
congratulate myself, I assure you; therefore you may do so to me."

     "I do heartily."

     "Thank you; I shall be happy.  But what are the tactics for the night?"

     "What are we to do?"

     "Yes, precisely."

     "Oh, suppose we have a nice party among ourselves.  We can amuse
ourselves, I dare say.  I am fatigued myself, and care not to go out to-
night.
We have all gone out so lately that it will be a change and a rest."

     "So it will," said Miss Stevens.  "I am really glad that we shall have
one night, on which we can retire at early hours."

     "Are you willing, Sir Francis, to spend a dull evening?"

     "It cannot be dull, at all events, in such company.  I shall be happy 
to
remain with you, indeed.  I feel that a quiet, happy evening is a thing that
would be very acceptable to me, at least; but still I can do as you please."

     "Then we'll have a quiet evening among ourselves."

     "Have you heard anything more about the murder that took place the 
other
day?"

     "No," replied Sir Francis.  "Have you?"

     "I have," said Mrs. Fraser.

     "What have you heard?" inquired Sir Francis.

     "I will tell you," replied Mrs. Fraser.  "You recollect that the nephew
had been suspected of having murdered the two women, and committed a robbery
afterwards."

     "Yes, yes; I heard so much."

     "Well, they ahve taken the nephew now, and he has been examined before 
a
police-constable, and will be again examined in another day or two."

     "Indeed! they have made quick work of it.  How can they suspect he had
any hand in the affair?"

     "I believe they knew he had been very poor, and had been very impatient
for the old woman's death, that he might have it all.  Now, such a line of
conduct was bad, and has caused persons to suspect him; and, also, the fact,
that he has got a quantity of gold about him, for the possession of which he
cannot account."

     "Ay, that seems bad; but what kind of excuse can he give for the
possession of such treasure-- he is surely not silent?"

     "Oh, dear, no, he is not silent.  All he says, however, is, that his 
aunt
gave it him to leave the country with."

     "That is strange-- very singular."

     "It is, and that is why they disbelieve it; besides; he had made no
preparations for his departure, that have yet been discovered-- besides, his
shoes were evidently soiled with human blood, and the footsteps in the 
passage
and on the stairs-- at least, some of them, were exactly of the same size."

     "That is a strong proof."

     "So it is; but there appears to have been an accomplice, for there are
other footmarks of a different size, much larger and longer."

     "Dear me," said Varney; "didn't you say there were many people who ran 
up
stairs after the man, who got away?"

     "Yes; to be sure."

     "Well, some of them might have left a foot-print."

     "Well, I suppose they might, and yet they must have reasons for saying
that these footsteps were those of an accomplice; perhaps they were fresher
than the others, or it may be they have a different appearance from the more
recent ones."

     "It may be so."

     "However it may be; it is quite certain that he has done the deed;
whether he had any help or not, he, at least, will be punished."

     "No doubt he ought to suffer for such a deed; it is that which gives
security to the rest of society."

     "But it was a dreadful thing.  A murder committed by a friend or 
relation
is, I think, more heinous, if possible, than when committed casually, by
ordinary murderers, whose sole crimes are murder and robbery."

     "To be sure; when any tie that can bind one individual to another is
broken, who would have taken precautions against such as those whom we 
value;
but he was ungrateful, and killed his benefactress-- for such she had been."

 Next Time: The Wedding Morning. -- The Progress of Justice, and the

                            CHAPTER CXLVIII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 156]

THE WEDDING MORNING. -- THE PROGRESS OF JUSTICE, AND THE DISCOVERY OF THE
MURDERER. -- THE DISSIPATION OF A SCENE.


     The days flew by, and the aspect of affairs insensibly changed.  Sir
Francis Varney gradually drew over the scene such an appearance of candour 
and
disinterestedness, that the Frasers were delighted with the prospect of such
an alliance, and they left no means of propitiating and influencing Miss
Stevens in his favour; and they succeeded to a certain exent in stifling all
expressions of dissent, and brought her to a state of passive obedience.

     She had nothing to allege against Sir Francis but her dislike to him, 
and
even that she felt was weaker, and the more she exerted her mind, the weaker
such impressions appeared to be; a convincing proof to her that it was a 
mere
blind, reasonless prejudices which it was her duty to throw off, and she
exerted herself to do so.

     Thus it was she became passive in the hands of her friends; and Sir
Francis Vareny had the satisfaction of seeing that he was about to pick up a
bride at length.  His pleasure knew no bounds, and his eyes glistened in a
manner, that once or twice Mary recoiled from him in terror, and she had
nearly revived her fist feelings against him.

     However that might have been, he saw his error, and he conducted 
himself
differently afterwards; for he too well knew the effect it must have upon 
the
artless and beautiful young girl, whose affections he cared not to win, so
that he stifled her objections, and obtained her hand-- her heart was not 
with
him an object.

     "I think now," said Captain Fraser to Sir Francis, when they were 
alone--
"I think, now, Sir Francis, that we ought to come to some understanding."

     "I shall be but too happy, Captain Fraser, to do so, in every sense of
the word, and upon every subject we can have in common."

     "Then we shall have no difficulty in this affair."

     "I hope not, I assure you."

     "Well, then, Sir Francis, you desire to marry into our family?"

     "Most unquestionably; my heart and fortune are at the disposal of Miss
Stevens.  I care for nothing else but her-- fortune, Captain Fraser, is no
object to me; I do not care for a single penny piece.  I have enough for
myself."

     "Money is not happiness itself," pursued the captain.

     "I believe it-- I feel it."

     "And yet Mary is not penniless; she has her dower, though by no means a
large one; yet she has one."

     "Then let the whole, whatever it may be, be safely, securely made over
for her own use, and that of her children."

     "It is generous-- very generous of you, Sir Francis; and your 
generosity
much embarrasses me, and I hardly know how to proceed with a little matter
which I deem a part of my duty to perform."

     "Do not let me be an hindrance to you; I am sure I should regret it 
much;
besides, the more we know of each other, the greater confidence we have in
each other, provided our knowledge is of that character that will increase 
our
respect."

     "You are quite right, Sir Francis."

     "Well, captain, I hope what you are going to say, will not give me 
cause
to feel myself less happy than I am."

     "I hope not; I believe not; but what I was about to say is a very
ordinary and common occurrence on an occasion like the present."

     "Well, let me know all about it, and then the murder will be out."

     "Good.  We have but little more than personal communication with each
other, apart from our respective homes; and we do not know much of each 
other
in the ordinary acceptation of the word.  I wish to know something relative 
to
your private affairs."

     "I really cannot do so, unless you travel northward with me."

     "Indeed-- indeed----"

     "Stop.  I can give you corroborative proof; I have none direct about 
me;
but I can do that much; but perhaps it will not do."

     "Quite enough.  I am satisfied-- if you can give me corroborative proof
of what you say, and that without premeditation, it will be still stronger 
and
more valuable."

     "If you think so, what do you say to those two letters, Captain 
Fraser?"

     "Two letters."

     "The one is from my gamekeeper, and the other is from my bailiff, who 
has
to overlook my property, and advise me of what was being done on the estate,
and the state of my financial affairs."

     "They will do, sir, I believe."

     As Captain Fraser took the two letters, he looked at the post-marks, 
and
saw that they were plain and readable, and the date: they had been correctly
described by Sir Francis Varney -- they came from the north, and one was a
business-like letter from the bailiff, and one quite in keeping from the 
head
gamekeeper, both of whom mentioned many local and petty matters, that fully
bore out all that was to be expected from them.

     "And do you keep up an establishment of this character, Sir Francis?"

     "I do.  I can afford it, and I do not like to turn the knaves adrift on
the world, who have, ever since they have been born, looked for abundance 
from
the soil that produced them; and I don't think I shall be justified in 
having
the hardness of heart to turn them off."

     "You are a kind and good master."

     "I wish to be so."

     "And when, Sir Francis, do you intend to return there?"

     "I am glad you ask the question.  I should like to take my bride there 
to
spend the honeymoon.  I wish now to leave other objects, and to get back as
soon as the ceremony is over.  There I should like to take her; it would be 
a
rare and splendid life to lead in the old gothic mansion-- as much like a
castle as anything I can describe; but an ornamented castle, of course, for 
I
don't mean high walls, and no windows."

     "Certainly not."

     "But will you assist me in obtaining her consent to a speedy union; 
and,
that effected, we will whirl off for the mansion, and you can follow us at
leisure.  The union will, I hope and believe, be most happy."

     "I hope so.  I trust and believe it will."

     "In the meantime, any more information or proof you can desire shall be
obtained for you.  Do not be backward upon this head."

     "I am quite satisfied, Sir Francis."

          *             *             *             *             *

     Thus Sir Francis Varney had succeeded in hoodwinking Captain Fraser and
his wife, and had now entirely subdued all shew of objection, and had so far
succeeded as to obtain a quiet and tacit consent to all he desired.

     The interveiew described was reported to Mrs. Fraser and her sister, 
and
was considered liberal and satisfactory, and the marriage was spoken of as
likely to be immediate, which brought forth no remark from Mary, and the
matter was considered as nearly settled; the day only was to be appointed, 
and
that could not be very distant.

     One morning as they were seated at breakfast, and that after the day 
had
been fixed at a greater distance of time than Sir Francis Varney liked, the
subject of the murder was again brought up, and Mrs. Fraser said, --

     "There is nothing more about the murder now-- is there?"

     "No," replied Sir Francis; "not that I have heard of.  I believe the
unfortunate man will be tried one of these days-- he stands committed."

     "Stop," said Captain Fraser, "here is something in the paper."

     "What is in it?"

     "Something more about the murder."

     "What is it?" inquired Sir Francis.  "I am anxious to learn if they 
have
done anything more, for I was sick of it, and wish to know when such a
horrible tragedy will end-- the sooner it is past and forgotten, the 
better."

     "That is true; for knowing a man is lying waiting for the hour to 
arrive
when he shall die a violent death, is truly terrible."

     "So it is.  They seem to say there is some clue to another person, of a
most remarkable appearance, who escaped through another house, and deceived
the inmates by describing a fire that was up stairs."

     "Indeed!  How strange," said Sir Francis.

     "Yes; they say they will not publish more, lest it defeat the ends of
justice."

     "Something else sprung up, I suppose?"

     "No doubt.  But here is something more: the prisoner will be tried in a
few days, and, if condemned, executed in a very short time."

     "Then I wish that one happy marriage would come off before that time.  
I
am sure Mary will be wretched, and I cannot be so happy as I could wish to
be."

     "Then postpone it for a few weeks."

     "No, no, no; that would never do; hasten it.  Besides, we should have 
to
pass through all the wretchedness consequent upon knowing a man-- a 
murderer,
it is true, and perhaps two of them-- that is waiting to die."

     "I think myself," said Captain Fraser, "that we might, with advantage,
leave Bath before the trial takes place.  It would certainly be more
comfortable."

     "So it would," said Mrs. Fraser; "and, to tell the truth, I begin to 
get
tired of this place, beautiful as it is.  In fact, I want to get to your
mansion in the north."

     "Not more than I do, madam," said Sir Francis.  "Will Miss Stevens 
permit
me to persuade her to shorten my period of probation, to escape some of the
disagreeables we have mentioned relative to this unhappy affair?"

          *             *             *             *             *

     The wedding morning was arrived.  Sir Francis Varney had not been 
sparing
of his ill-gotten gains.  He willingly made some handsome presents to Mrs.
Fraser and Mary Stevens; jewels were the form he gave them in; and Sir 
Francis
himself took care to display no small degree of ornament, and yet he 
appeared
to be a man, who, though wearing and having the best of all, still wore but
little ornament.

     But the occasion made the change in his habit.  And now the post horses
are ready at the door-- ready to bear them northwards.  They are at the 
church.
Sir Francis, and Mary Stevens leaning upon his arm, come before the altar, 
and
the friends of the bride were on either side of them.  The clergyman was 
about
to read, but asked first, if any knew any causes or impediment, &c., to the
marriage.

     No answer was returned; when there was some bustle at the other end of
the church, and the clergy man paused to ascertain its character.

     In a moment more there was a motley group of persons making towards the
altar; and foremost among these were two or three peace officers, and after
them a woman, dressed in many clothes, which added to her natural obesity.

     "Ah, that's him-- that's the wagabone that said my house was on fire 
when
it warn't; that's him as frightened me so, that I'm quite thin through it."

     "Shiver my timbers, and they begin to creak a bit now-- d--n the gout! 
--
but that's Varney, the vampyre!  Who'd a thought he would always be turning 
up
in this way, like an old mop as nobody can use?"

     Varney turned to the clergyman, and begged that these mad people might 
be
turned out, and, after the ceremony, he would meet any proper accusation at 
a
proper time and place; but he showed his anger so strongly, that Mary shrank
from him; while the two officers demanded him as a prisoner.

     The clergyman yielded; and Sir Francis, striking the officer near him
down, made a rush at a side door, and escaped.

     The fact was, there had been more than one doubt about the murder; and
Sir Francis had been followed to the hotel the night of the murder by one of
the waiters, who came up behind him.  They took his shoes, and found they 
were
bloody; and all things beign traced home to him, it was agreed to capture 
him
at home; but he had left for the church, when the officers followed him.  
Old
Admiral Bell, who was gouty, happened to see him pass, and determined to
unmask him, which he did.

 Next Time: The Murder in the Wood Del Notti. -- A Neapolitan Scene.




                            CHAPTER CXLIX. [sic]

                               [Chapter 157]

THE MURDER IN THE WOOD DEL NOTTI. -- A NEAPOLITAN SCENE.


     There had been a great heat during the day, even for the sunny shore of
Naples.  Not a cloud had been seen all day, not a breath of air had been
stirring; all was golden sunshine -- all was fair; the very sea glittered 
like
molten gold, and the heat was oppressive in the extreme -- so much so that
even the Neapolitans themselves stirred not out of doors, but sank listless
and sleepy on the couch, fanning themselves, and endeavouring to create an 
air
that would give some slight refreshment.

     Even the sea was calm -- the very waves lashed the shore lazily, and
appeared to partake of the general weariness that came over all nature -- 
all
things that moved.

     There was no soul stirring in the villas that were seen dotted about 
the
environs of Naples, most of them like palaces, surrounded on every side by
gardens and fountains, walled in, and secure from the intrusion of a 
stranger.

     There was one of great magnificence adjoining the small wood Del Notti,
that reared its stately structure on a slope looking towards the sea, though
at a mile or two's distance, but close adjoining the wood.

     The gardens were extensive, and abutted on the wood, which was a cool 
and
shady spot at most times, and if such a one were now to be found, it would
certainly be found in the wood Del Notti.

     The trees grew tall, and spread their branches out until they 
interlaced
each other so completely, that when the foliage was on them the light rarely
found its way to the earth, save in a dim and diluted form.

     Here there might now and then be found some of those who had been
overtaken by the heat of the day, or who from choice preferred the coolness 
of
the woods to the walls of their houses.  Here, then, reposing beneath the
great trees, might occasionally be found a few individuals who slept in
coolness and shade.

     Near the wall of the villa where the wood ran were some tall black 
trees,
mostly fir and cedar; there beneath one of the latter lay a tall,
gaunt-looking man, who, notwithstanding the weather, was wrapped up in a 
cloak
of large dimensions, and sable colour.

     There was something strange in that man's appearance; above all, the
cloak which he wore was a thing so much out of place, that none other than
himself could or would have worn it.  What was his motive none could divine,
were it not for the concealment of his person, which seemed likely enough.

     His slouched hat was bent over his eyes; his face was scarcely
distinguishable between the collar of the cloak and the hat, though he lay 
on
his back motionless, and without heeding aught that neared him.

     It was true, there did not exist any reason why he should take any 
heed,
seeing that at that point no one ever came.  It was a spot that was not
frequented, having a bad name, which usually deters people from trusting
themselves in such a place.

     However, the stranger lay motionless, and apparently without fear.
Perhaps it was the long two-edged sword he wore, that gave him his security;
at all events, he lay there in silence, and almost motionless -- quite and
entirely so, save the motion in breathing; and his eye now and then turned 
in
a particular direction.

     The hours rolled by, and no one approached, till the sun sunk towards 
the
ocean, there to bury himself till another morrow appeared.

     The heat of the high noon was past, and the shadows of the trees 
reduced
the light in the wood to a twilight; and the stranger arose and stood 
beneath
the shadow of a tall one, while he appeared to be listening for some sound
which he appeared to expect from some particular quarter of the wood.

     The hour of noon is some hours past; and with it a gentle sea breeze
begins to fan the heated shores, and here and there might be seen some of 
the
inhabitants creeping about in the shady places.

     The stranger listened, and from the quarter to which he appeared most 
to
direct his attention, he heard sounds proceed.  These were those made by
persons walking over the dried leaves and sticks which lay scattered about
from the effects of the storms that sometimes visit even these pleasant
shores.

     "She comes!" he muttered, and his eye glanced round, and he grasped the
hilt of his sword.  "She comes! but does she come alone?"

     He paused, and again listened.

     "She comes not alone-- another is with her; but no matter; she shall
come.  I have the means of security here.  But, above all, I need _her_."

     He paused again, and listened, but quietly drew his sword, which was 
long
and sharp, and stood beneath the tree, while the voices and sounds slowly
approached, until they came quite distinct and audible.

     "And so," said a man's voice, but in a low key, "the marchese is not
well."

     "She is quite indisposed."

     "I was about to say I could hardly feel it in my heart to regret it."

     "And why could you be so unfeeling?"

     "Because, by dear Fiametta, had she been well, you would scarce have 
got
away from her this evening, and I should have had but little of your sweet
company."

     "I admit that; but were you not selfish in desiring it?"

     "Yes, I was."

     "And are you not ashamed to say so?"

     "No, I am not, Fiametta.  I can acknowledge anything that concerns 
myself
and you; for I must admit a great deal of selfishness in this matter.  I 
love
you tenderly, and that puts all the world beside us.  I think nothing of any
one save you, and for you I would sacrifice the whole world."

     "I am fearful of you."

     "And wherefore should you be fearful of me, fair one?  Am I not willing
and ready to fight and die for you?  I would not fear the summons of death
this moment, if I knew that I could save you but one hour's pang."

     "I hope," said Fiametta, leaning on her lover's arm, "I hope that you
will never be called upon for so sad a a sacrifice.  I am sure I should 
never
know an hour's happiness if I thought there was a possibility of it."

     "I do not think there is any possibility of that happening.  But,
Fiametta, when do you hope for an end to this slavery?  Can't you leave the
old marchese? -- she is anything but kind to you, and would marry you to one
of her poor relatives; and unless you marry with her consent, you will never
be rewarded for the many listless hours you have passed, night after night, 
at
her bedside."

     "But she will reward me when she dies."

     "What an age to wait!"

     "Surely you cannot grudge her life!"

     "I do not, only so long as it is a term of imprisonment for you.  If 
you
would leave her, and come back with me, I will make you happy.  You shall 
have
a happy home, and form new ties, and new affections."

     "I have not got so tired of the old, that it is necessary to change 
them;
but I cannot leave the marchese.  She is almost alone-- no one goes near her
to do her a good office, and I am her only friend."

     "And yet she won't give you liberty."

     "She says I am too young, and, if you must know all, she says I am too
pretty to be trusted in everybody's company."

     "I must admit there is much of truth in that, and yet I cannot see its
application in this instance, as far as I am concerned."

     "No; that is not to be expected from you, you know; but this must be
admitted, that she speaks of men in general.  Besides, she says, if I have
patience to await her death, she will handsomely endow me."

     "Upon my word, I think the old woman only wants to lease her life a few
years longer, or, I should say, wishes to live forever."

     "How can you make that appear?"

     "Thus-- when you are waiting for people's deaths, you never do succeed 
in
hearing of their dying within any reasonable space.  It gives them new life,
and the spirit of opposition and obstinacy is created within them, and they
won't die."

     "For shame."

     "Nay, you will find, Fiametta, that we shall both grow grey-headed in
waiting for the happy moment when you and I are man and wife.  Do not stay,
then, any longer, leave here, and come with me; we shall be happy, and defy
the world."

     "But look what a dowry I shall lose."

     "Never mind about that.  Such a dowry would not make you young again, 
nor
would it recall many years of past service and attendance upon her.  You 
must
know how very precarious such a life must be.  It may so happen that you may
forfeit all you have deserved through some fancy of this old woman.  She may
take it into her head to insist upon your marrying her poor cousin there.  
You
know, if you were to displease her, she might very easily leave you nothing
for your pains."

     "I admit all that; but it amounts to nothing, because she has said as
much that she would never force me, only she wished me to marry him, as 
being
a worthy man and one who would act justly to me through life."

     "Justly through life!  What a sound!  It sounds but little of love.
Justly, indeed!  I would I could act no otherwise to others, but to you,
Fiametta, I should as soon think of forgetting you as merely acting justly.  
I
love you; I would, at this moment, lay down my life for you."

     At that moment they neared the stranger, who was standing silently and
motionless, with his sword concealed beneath his cloak, but eagerly watching
them, and devouring every word they uttered; and, by degrees, they drew 
nearer
and nearer.

     "I am sure it will be wise to wait awhile.  I am sure the poor old
marchese will not live long. She cannot eat and drink, save with great
difficulty.  I am sure we shall not have long to wait."

     "I am willing to abide by your wishes, Fiametta; but it cannot be well 
to
wait for an age-- it cannot be well to wait till we are old."

     "I know that; but----"

     Fiametta screamed, as her eye fell upon the stranger, who rushed out 
upon
them, with his sword drawn.  This gave her male companion time to defend
himself, by, in the first instance, jumping aside.

     "Mercy! mercy!" screamed Fiametta.

     Her lover drew his sword, and put himself upon his defence, saying, as 
he
parried the first thrust of his enemy,--

     "Villain! what mean you?  Is it robbery you would attempt, or murder
alone?  Will nothing but shedding blood satisfy you?"

     The stranger made no reply, but pressed on furiously, and with great
strength and skill, for two or three minutes, when Fiametta's lover, by
changing his ground, contrived to elude so desperate an assault upon his 
life.

     Fiametta, however, believed her lover was getting the worst of it.  She
screamed out for help several times, but none came.  However, it caused the
stranger to press his adversary more quickly, and to hasten his own 
movements,
for he was quite desperate and furious; but this laid him open to the 
assaults
of the other.  But, so fierce the attack, and such was the strength 
exhibited,
that Fiametta's lover was compelled to give ground.

     "What is your object, villain? -- speak!"

     But the stranger spoke not, but furiously threw himself upon him, and
endeavoured to beat down his guard, which his great strength and height 
almost
enabled him to do; but as the other gave ground he was obliged to follow 
him,
and then his foot caught against some of the tangled roots that grew out of
the earth, and threw him forward; adn his adversary, not slow to profit by 
it,
and rid himself of so dangerous an enemy, stepped forward and received him
upon the point of his sword.

     "A good deliverance," said the lover, drawing his sword out of the body
as it fell to the earth-- "a timely deliverance, truly."

     He wiped his forhead, for the perspiration streamed down his face; the
day was warm, and his exertion great.

     "Oh, Jose," exclaimed Fiametta, "what a horrid man!"

     "A brigand, I suppose."

     "But he said nothing-- he asked nothing."

     "No, he meant murder; there is no doubt of it, now, in the world; but I
never saw such an ill-looking wretch before."

     As Jose spoke, he kicked the hat and cloak off which the brigand wore,
and which remained partially on.  There was a ghastly wound in his breast
where Jose's sword entered and let out the life of the the stranger.

     He was very tall, but thin and emaciated; his features remarkable, and 
he
wore some straight, straggling hair, that was disordered, and fell over his
forehead and face of more than marble paleness.

     "Well, I never met with such an encounter before, and I never met with
such an ill-looking villain," said Jose.  "Come away, Fiametta; we need not
say anything to any one about the affair.  I will not come here again, 
though
it may be needless to take the precaution, seeing that none could be brought
to match this fellow in villany and ugliness; at least, it is so to my mind.
Come away."

     Wiping his sword on the cloak of the fallen man, and sheathing it, he
took the hand of Fiametta, and drawing it through his arm, left the spot.

 Next Time: A Maiden's Mind Disturbed. -- An Easy Way of Promoting Comfort 
of
 Conscience. -- The Monk.




                              CHAPTER CL. [sic]

                               [Chapter 158]

A MAIDEN'S MIND DISTURBED. -- AN EASY WAY OF PROMOTING COMFORT OF 
CONSCIENCE.
-- THE MONK. 


     The spot was deserted, and no soul came near; but the body lay, with 
its
ghastly wound, all sopping in its gore.  It was a fitting place for such a
scene as this; no sound was heard, and the lazy hours turned slowly over, 
till
the shades of evening came on apace; the light grew dim, and darkness
increased; but there the dead body of the tall, remarkable-looking stranger
lay, without motion.  It was cold and bloodless -- death had long since
deprived it of its last spark of animation.

          *             *             *             *             *

     Jose and Fiametta quitted the neighbourhood of the deed of darkness as
quickly as they could, and it was many minutes before either of them spoke, 
so
filled were their minds with the reflections natural to, and consequent 
upon,
the strange occurrence that had just before fallen upon them.

     At length Fiametta broke silence, by saying, --

     "Oh, Jose, what a dreadful thing has happened!"

     "Truly, it had like to have been a dreadful affair; but it don't matter
now, he's settled, I believe."

     "Yes; but you have killed a man."

     "Truly, my dear Fiametta, I have killed a man, or devil, I don't yet 
know
which; but that man would have killed me if I had not done so."

     "Yes, he would; but how dreadful."

     "So that being the case, it is, in my opinoon, a very good job he is
dead; a very good job, indeed; he will be safe where he is."

     "But still," said Fiametta, crossing herself, "how dreadful it must be 
to
be slain thus; with all one's sins upon one's head."

     "What would have been my fate?"

     "As bad, and to me it would have been worse by far; but still it is
really dreadful to think that there should be a soul thus sent to heaven
without so much as the good offices of a priest."

     "He would have killed me without giving me time for repentance.  He 
would
have forced me to leave a world in which I have all happiness yet to know; a
world which I am by no means prepared to quit."

     "Truly no, Jose, nor I; but what a state for this man to be in; he is 
so
much the worse prepared than even you, because his end was bad; now, you had
no evil intention."

     "None-- none."

     "You did not know even that you were in danger from him."

     "I did not, Fiametta, else I had never brought you there.  I cannot
understand what brought him there-- what he wanted, or why it was he made 
such
a desperate attack upon me; my life was aimed at."

     "It was, Jose; but have you no private enemy, whom you believe capable 
of
such a deed as this?  Surely-- surely it cannot be done, save from some
motive."

     "That is the thing that most puzzles me; I cannot understand the 
motive.
I know him not; I have no enemy who would hire an assassin; but there let 
him
and his deed lie buried in oblivion."

     "He has no burial."

     "He deserves none," said Jose.

     "But, dear Jose, do you not think we ought to give him one."

     "Are we his executors or heirs?"

     "God forbid! -- but we saw him die, and not for his sake, but for the
sake of human nature, do not let us leave him unburied like a dog.  He may 
not
deserve it, bu he has answered all his offence."

     "Yes, yes; I admit he has been punished-- he paid to the uttermost all 
he
owed me, and I gave him a receipt in full.  He will never make another 
demand
upon me; we have quite done with each other, I believe."

     "I shall never forget the horrible sight; it will haunt me day and 
night;
I shall not be able to banish the terrible features from my mind.  I shall, 
in
truth, pass a sad life; I wish this had never happened."

     "Why, so do I, dear Fiametta; but, surely, you do not accuse me of 
wrong,
in having, to save my life, killed this man.  I was compelled, forced to do
it; it was either his life or mine; and, the truth to tell, I never was in
such peril, from any single sword, in all my life, and but for the lucky
accident that laid him open, I had not been here with you, but where he now
is."

     "Thank God for you deliverance, Jose; but-- but what a revolting thing 
to
remember, that in the wood Del Notti, there lies a corrupting mass of
humanity, over which loathsome insects crawl; a thing that had once been a
living soul like ourselves; but now, alas! what is he?"

     "But, Fiametta, your grief appears misplaced; you mourn this stranger 
as
if he was near and dear to you.  Do you know him?"

     "Not I," said Fiametta, sorrowfully.

     "Then what have you to grieve about, Fiametta?  Tell me truly.  You 
have
nothing to blame yourself with.  I do not feel I have acted wrongly.  Say 
what
it is that causes you so much sorrow."

     "I grieve to think that the body of that sinful and wicked man lies
unburied, and that no masses have been said for the repose of his soul."

     "If that be all you require to set your mind at rest-- though the 
villain
deserves it not-- I will see that he is buried and masses said for him."

     "Will you, indeed, Jose?"

     "Upon my conscience, I will see your desire executed."

     "Well, then, Jose, yonder lives a holy monk.  He is a pious and good 
man,
and will, I am sure, do all that is required-- watch and pray by the body 
till
midnight, and continue there until the sun shall illumine the wood.["]

     "Be it so, my dear Fiametta-- be it so.  We will go to the holy man and
tell him of our distress, and will reward him; and then I will see you in
safety, and return to conduct him to the spot where you know we left the 
body.
I would the villain had come by a less noble death than falling by the 
sword."

     ["]It will be a danger that will never be forgotten by me," said
Fiametta.

     "Nor by me," replied Jose.  "What that man meant I cannot conceive.  
But
then there can be but one answer to the question-- he meant robbery; nothing
else could have tempted him to draw his sword upon me."

     "But why did he not demand your money at once?"

     "Because he might meet with what he has met; and he took me at a
disadvantage, and, of course, gave him a better chance of killing me, and
running less danger in doing so.  I am not, therefore, surprised at it."

     "Here is the holy father's residence.  He is poor-- very poor; but,
withal, he is very good.  He is a holy man."

     "Then he will serve our turn the better; for it would, in my opinion,
take something more than a saint to pray out of purgatory such a soul as his
must be.  It must wing its way through space very much like a bat."

     "Hush, Jose-- hush!  Not a word about that.  Here is the holy man's
abode.  Shall I enter with you?"

     "If you will, Fiametta-- if you will."

     Fiametta stood by her lover's side while he knocked at the holy man's
door, and, after a pause of about a minute, a deep voice said, --

     "Who is it that knocks at my door?"

     "'Tis one who needs your service, good father."

     "Enter," said the monk, and a bolt was withdrawn.  The door opened, and
Fiametta followed her lover into a hovel, or rather a bare room, in which 
was
nothing, save some straw in one corner, and some few clothes; besides which
there were one or two articles of necessary use and convenience, but they 
were
very few indeed.

     "Well, my son, what wouldst thou?  Dost thou require mine aid to bind
thee to this maiden, and she to thee?"

     "I do indeed wish so much, but she is not willing."

     "Not willing!  Then wherefore dost thou come to me?"

     "You see, holy father, as we were walking in the wood Del Notti, which 
I
dare say you well enough know----"

     "I do, my son."

     "Well, I was talking to my companion, heedless of danger, nor dreaming
any could be at hand, when my attention was attracted to a spot on the right
of me whence a man rushed out upon me, with a drawn sword, and attacked me."

     "I should not have had time to see him, much less time to draw and 
defend
myself, but for the scream of her who was by my side.  I looked where I saw
her look, and saw him advancing, and had time to spring back and draw."

     "Did you kill your opponent?"

     "As it fell out, good father, I did.  He rushed on and pressed me so
hard, that I had no alternative.  My life was in great danger, and I could 
not
rid myself of my enemy, or preserve my own life, except at the expense of
his."

     "Did you slay him?"

     "I did."

     "Another soul ushered into eternity," said the monk, gloomily.  "How 
long
will it be before the wickedness of men shall cease to bear such fruits?"

     "But, holy father, I did but act lawfully in saving my life. It was 
only
the law that nature has implanted in us, and can hardly be called 
wickedness,
since Heaven itself gives us the power and impulse."

     "Hold thy peace, my son, thou knowest nothing of these matters; 
therefore
I say hold thy peace, and let me know what it is you desire of me."

     "That you will say masses for the repose of his soul, and give him
Christian burial.  I do not like-- we do not like such a portion of humanity
to remain where it is; we would it were not entirely neglected, or deprived 
of
burial rites."

     "It is but just of thee, my son; but I have known many who would have
neglected it altogether, and permitted the body of one of God's creatures to
lie and rot like a dog.  My son, you have done well, and I will, for your
sake, do mine office."

     "Nay, holy father, I cannot permit thee to do it wholly without giving
the church some due, and here in this purse you will find all I have."

     "I take it, my son, not for my own sake, but for that of the church, to
whom belongs all that is offered her."

     "And this, too, holy father," said Fiametta, giving a samll purse; 
"take
that, and for my sake do what may be done by those on earth for those who 
have
departed from it by a violent and sudden death."

     "I will, daughter."

     "And now, holy father," said Jose, "if you will, I am ready to take you
to the spot where fell this man."

     "I will follow, my son," said the monk, concealing his two gifts 
beneath
his garments, but rising at the same time -- "I'll follow thee."

     They all left the place, but went a circuitous route, to enable Jose to
leave Fiametta in safety at the marquise's villa, where she resided in half
dependence, being a distant relative of her's.

     Jose led on the monk until he came to the spot where the stranger fell,
and where he yet lay just as he had fallen -- a ghastly cor[p]se.

     "Here, holy father, you see the caitiff, a treacherous villain, who has
now been paid for his villany-- for, perhaps, a life of villany."

     "Perhaps so, my son.  He does not appear to have been formed by nature
when in one of her most kindly moods; but yet it might have been she 
impressed
his character upon his features as a warning to the rest of mankind."

     "It was so, most likely; but you see he is slain.  Fiametta would never
have known peace again unless the body was watched through the night by some
holy man, and prayed for.  That is what is desired, holy father; and now I
will leave you to your task, bidding you adieu, and wishing your office a
prosperous one, and a pleasant night to watch by."

 Next Time: The Watch by the Dead Man's Side. -- The Dead Alive. --
 The Death-Struggle, and the Murder of the Monk.




                              CHAPTER CLI. [sic]

                               [Chapter 159]

THE WATCH BY THE DEAD MAN'S SIDE. -- THE DEAD ALIVE. -- THE DEATH-STRUGGLE,
AND THE MURDER OF THE MONK.


     The monk gazed after Jose for some moments, until he had vanished from
his sight; even then he continued gazing upon the vacant space that he 
lately
filled, as if meditating in his own mind, and quite unmindful of the 
present.
At length he turned and gazed upon the clay-cold corse before him.

     There it lay in all its hideousness -- all its horrible reality.  The
slouched hat was knowcked off in the fall, and the face was exposed to view.

     "Ave Maria!" muttered the monk, telling his beads.  "I never before saw
so unfavourable a looking creature.  I pray Heaven he may have been better
favoured in grace than in features-- that he may make a better appearance
spiritually than bodily.  I would I had had time to speak with him before 
his
spirit fled, for I misdoubt me much of his salvation-- but I will not charge
him with unknown sin."

     "That," he muttered, after a pause, "might, indeed, be quite 
unnecessary,
seeing his appearance and his deeds-- at least the only one I know of is of 
a
like character; were it otherwise, I would be loth to doubt him; but two 
such
proofs are enough to damn the best spoken-of being in all Christendom."

     He paused again; examined the features of the dead man, but could not
appear at all satisfied with the success of his ministry.

     "I would sooner have had some poor, but honest corpse to watch by," he
said as he gazed upon the long white visage of the dead man, whose leaden 
eye
appeared fixed upon him;  "I would," he continued, "much sooner have had 
some
early flower cut down before its prime-- I could have wept and prayed for 
him,
then; but this, alas! was but full-grown iniquity, I strongly fear-- it 
cannot
be otherwise."

     The monk sank down upon a tree.

     "Alas! what a sinner I am, for uttering such a thought-- nay, I am 
worse
for conceiving such a thought, and expressing it must be heinous.  To have
such a one would be to cut off the most worthy, instead of looking at the
destruction of the full grown sinner in all his pride and moral deformity, 
as
being the full extent of the length he was permitted to go by Devine wisdom
and intelligence.  He has filled his measure of iniquity, and the Lord hath
cut him off in the midst of his sins."

     The monk now devoutly crosed himself, and muttered several of his Ave
Marias and paternosters, and prayed in bad Latin for some time, nearly an
hour, when he appeared to think he might be indulged in a rest from his
theological labour, and that his mind might refresh itself.

     The monk arose and paced about the body for some minutes in solemn and
deep wonder at the place chosen for such a deed.

     A number of fresh thoughts now rushed through his mind, as he assigned
all possible motives for the deed that had been done, or attempted to be 
done;
and, also, for the choice of spot; but this speculation was more curious 
than
useful.

     Time passed by, and the hours rolled on, and darkness came on apace.  A
heavy atmosphere seemed to hang over him, and the light gradually faded 
away,
and the moon showed no light on that night.

     "It is dark," muttered the monk, "but the Lord is my light, and 
darkness
has no fears for me.  I am in the discharge of my ministry, and am safe.  
The
dead man lies quiet and still-- no sound comes thence."

     He listened, but no sound; not the rustle of a leaf could be heard; not 
a
breath of air stirred.  All was silent and still; no one sound disturbed the
stillness of the night -- all was quiet.

     "It is a night of death," said the monk to himself -- " a night such as
might be supposed to exist if the last man had ceased to live."

     There was a weight in the air that appeared stronger, and had an effect
upon the monk, and made a gloomy feeling come over him.

     "What ails me?" he said to himself.  "I am not strong and confident as 
I
am wont to be-- the reverse; I am doubting, and very sad.  Yet why should I 
be
sad-- I, a minister of religion?  I, at all times, am prepared to die, or
ought to be.

     "And yet there is the clinging after life, as in all; but I am mortal, 
as
other men are.  I have not all the motives for life they have.  I am alone 
in
the world.  I am but a pilgrim, whose stay is short, and who leaves behind 
him
nothing to remember, and no one to remember me.  It is better it is so than
otherwise."

     The monk paused again, and approached the trunk of the tree, upon which
he sat in deep meditation for more than an hour, without altering his 
posture,
or uttering a single word.  a whole hour passed thus.

     "Now," muttered the monk, as if waking up from a profound meditation,
"man is here but in a state of probation.  If he were not, what would be the
explanation of the chequered course he runs, what the use of all the various
stages he goes through during a long life, and then to drop into rottenness 
at
last?"

     "Why are we educated and improved, if for any other purpose?  Why 
should
we spend years in improving ourselves, only to be deprived of the jewel at
last, and to have it not only taken, but destroyed.

     "No-- no; it is for better use."

     The monk's mind was evidently disturbed in regard to some speculation
which had been suggested by the solitary moments of his watch.  At such 
times,
all the strange and inquiring thoughts that could be devised by man usually
arise and enter his mind, and strange doubts and fancies will supervene, 
when
all other thoughts have been banished, and they take their place.

     Man's mind is always liable to these fanciful intrusions, and will 
remain
so, while there is a single important assertion or circumstances existing,
incapable of positive and mathematical demonstration.

     When all shall be clear, and when there shall be no longer any play for
the mind -- any room for imagination -- any possibility of conception left,
then doubt may be cleared up, and an unanimity might be raised upon such a
structure that never would be raised under any other circumstances whatever.

     But, as this is not likely to happen, human doubt will exist, more or
less, to all; we shall none of us be freed from that great cause of all the
calamities of races.  But to proceed with our narrative.

     The monk looked around him.  He could, however, see nothing, save the 
few
trees near him, but beyond that he was unable to see.  There was a strong 
mist
up -- one that limited vision, and left no room for any other object to 
shine
through, and diversify the scene.

     "I would," muttered the monk, "that the morning would come.  There is 
no
light; the moon is hidden; no rays penetrate the dense air; and all the 
while
the air is close and muggy, Not a star out, or luminary visible."

     He looked upwards, and found he could see the spot where the moon was
striving to force its rays through some thinner stratum of the clouds; but 
it
was doubtful, and the monk, of very weariness, began to count his beads and 
to
repent his paternosters, between whiles and alternately, untill he grew 
weary.

     It wanted yet an hour of midnight, and the night would not be passed 
for
many hours, and the monk thought that the nights were long.

     "It is cold," he muttered; "but yet 'tis not midnight.  'Tis the 
moisture
with which the air is loaded, and thus it is cool more rapidly than it could
have otherwise happened; but it matters not to me-- if I were to lose my 
life,
I shall only be called home in my minstry; therefore it matters not.  I am 
in
the discharge of my duty, and shall have the reward appropriate to the
service."

     A slight breeze sprung up, and in a short time the mist was cleared 
off,
and not a cloud was to be seen on the horizon.

     There might be seen the moon rising slowly and majestically, while a
gentle and diffused light shed its influence throughout the wood.  Of course
its direct rays could not enter until it had risen to its full height.

     "Ha!" said the monk, "now I shall be relieved of some of the terrors of
my watch; it will cease to be so tedious and so long; but, no matter, I am
content, quite content.  Soon I shall be able to see the body, and then I 
will
close its eyes.  I had forgotten to do so before; but it is time enough."

     "Pater noster," again began the monk, until he came to the last word, 
by
which time the light was enough to enable him to discover the body plainly;
then he knelt down by its side to pray, and gazed on its features.

     "I see its eyes are glaring wildly-- aye, no wonder! no wonder! he met
with a sudden, painful, and violent death.

     "Poor erring mortality! what an end to come to; but, alas! what can men
expect?  He who lives by the sword will die by the sword."

     The monk closed the eyes of the dead man, and pulled the cloak, which 
lay
open, over him, and then leaned back against a tree, and shut his eyes for a
moment; but they did not remain long shut, for some fancied noise drew him 
out
of a train of speculation he was indulging in.

     "He moves not!" he muttered.

     However, he knelt down by the side of the body, and began to repeat his
paternoster again, and for a few moments shut his eyes, as if he had no
service for them, and continued his prayers without intermission.

     The moon's rays now came with their full effulgence, and the forest
appeared like some enormous piece of lattice work; for the moon's rays were
able to penetrate the leaves and branches of many of the trees.

     The moonbeams at length fell upon the body of the dead man, and he got
slowly up until he rested on his elbow with his face towards the moon; and 
the
monk, who yet remained kneeling, was still praying with his eyes wholly 
shut.

     "Ha!" groaned the stranger.

     The monk stopped in his prayer, started, and opened his eyes, which 
were
fixed, in an extremity of terror and horror, upon the apparition before him 
--
he was entranced, and had no power to remove his eyes.

     "Ha!" said the figure, slowly rising to a sitting posture, but, at the
same time, immediately facing the unfortunate and wretched monk, who was
prostrated by fear.

     "Ha!" groaned the figure, by a strange effort.

     "My God-- my God!" exclaimed the monk, save me-- save me!"

     He endeavoured to rise, but shook so much he could not do it, for the
figure kept its horrible eye fixed upon him, and he shook violently; but 
after
a while he contrived to say, scarcely audible though,

     "Avaunt, Satan, I command thee."

     The figure heeded it not, but took some ominous proceedings, by laying
its hands upon the monk's shoulder; but this had the effect of releasing him
from his spell, and he sprang to his feet, exclaiming, --

     "The Lord of Hosts aid me!"

     The figure replied not, but rising without taking his hand off, a 
deadly
struggle ensued between the two, which lasted some minutes.  The monk, being
driven desperate, resisted with great strength; but he had one to deal with,
whose strength was far beyond his, and he felt himself gradually sinking,
till, after another effort, which ended in a wild shriek, he was forced on 
his
knees.

     In this posture the strange man seized him by the throat, which he
compressed, and thrust his knees into his chest, until the unfortunate and
wretched man was quite dead and senseless.

 Next Time: The Devil a Monk Would Be. -- The Demand for Admission into the
 Convent of St. Mary Magdalen. -- The Fortress and the Monk.






                             CHAPTER CLII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 160]

THE DEVIL A MONK WOULD BE. -- THE DEMAND FOR ADMISSION INTO THE CONVENT OF
ST. MARY MAGDALEN. -- THE FORTRESS AND THE MONK.


     It was some minutes before the stranger, who had so newly risen from 
the
dead, let go of the grasp he had of the monk's throat.  He held him firmly 
by
the throat by both hands; but as he stood grasping him, his face was turned
upwards towards the moon's rays, which fell upon his breast and features,
insomuch that he appeared to gain strength at every breath he drew.

     But what a ghastly face he wore; what a death-like paleness spread over
his forehead; the horrible looking eyes appeared to throw back the light of
the moon, much the same as its rays are reflected by glass.

     The unfortunate monk was partially kneeling, his back forced against 
the
trunk of the tree, upon which he had been sitting, his face turned upwards,
and his eyes almost bursting from their sockets, while his hands 
convulsively
grasped those of his enemy; but his strength decreased as that of the other
increased; his cowl fell off, and his bare head was exposed to the 
moonlight.

     There was a death-like pause, and the figure slowly released its hold
upon the throat of the monk and stepped back a pace or two to look upon his
work.  The monk's body retained the posture given to it by the efforts to
extinguish his life, and appeared as though his muscles had rigidly set in
death, but the trunk of the tree itself was a sufficient support.

     "Dead!" muttered the figure; "dead!"

     Again he moved about, and went into an open space, where the moonlight
came uninterruptedly, without any barrier, and from this spot he surveyed 
the
hideous work of his hands.

     "Dead-- dead!" muttered the figure.

     This was undoubtedly true; and yet there remained the body of the monk,
which, but for the turn of the head backwards, and its face upwards, it 
might
be easily supposed that he had died in the attitutde of devotion or
supplication; but, as it was, it was evident by what means he had come by 
his
death.

     "I must have a victim," muttered the stranger; "am I always to meet 
with
the pangs of death but to renew such a life on such term!  Never to obtain a
renewal without the pangs of death; and why? because I have not been able to
obtain the voluntary consent of one that is young, beautiful and a virgin; I
might then for a season escape the dreaded alternative."

     He walked round and round the body of the monk for some time, and then 
he
came and sat down by its side upon the trunk of the tree, and appeared lost 
in
contemplation; but at length he looked at the body, saying, --

     "Ay, ay-- I have a plan.  The church has furnished many a victim-- let 
it
furnish me with one.  The church will furnish the sacrifice, and will give 
me
the means of obtaining the offering.  Well and good; it shall be done."

     He arose, and walked about the body once more, and then approached it;
having apparently made up his mind, he came to it, saying, --

     "I will become a monk, too, of the most holy order of St. Francis; yes,
that will serve me well enough.  I will take his cassock, it will serve my
turn, and be a ready introduction to the religious world.  I am the good 
monk
Francis myself.  My learning and sanctity is great; it will carry all before
it, and I shall be in great request.  It will indeed be strange if there be 
no
fruit upon such a tree.  I am sure I shall deserve it."

     He seized the body, and pulled off the monk's clothing, and quickly
apparelled himself in it, leaving the body as if fell by the side of the 
tree;
and, having thrown his own clothes on one side, he drew the cowl over his
head, and, seizing the staff he brought with him, he was about to leave the
spot; but a sudden thought occurred to him, and he turned back, and began to
rummage among the pockets of the monk.

     "These churchmen, I have heard, never travel without something of value
about them, and his gold, if he have any, may as well be mine as any one
else's who may be passing this way."

     He found the two purses that had been given him by Fiametta and Jose, 
and
some that he had beside; moreover, there were some letters and papers, which
he put into his pocket, merely observing, --

     "These will enable me to pass for the character I assume successfully.  
I
am and will be a monk.  I will shrive and confess poor deluded souls, and 
send
them on their eternal journeys."

     A ghastly and hideous smile crossed his face; and having burthened
himself with what he thought necessary, or worth while, he quitted the spot.

          *             *             *             *             *

     There were two convents, or nunneries, near the city of Naples, at some
short distance apart from each other.

     One was the convent of St. Mary Magdalen, and the other was the convent
of St. Cecilia, about a mile and a half apart, or perhaps more-- some said a
league; and so it was by the road, but not in a direct line.

     It was late one evening, when the great bell of the convent of St. Mary
Magdalen gave warning from without that some one demanded admission.  The
superior of the convent, a woman far advanced in age, and somewhat proud of
her character, and not a little disposed to personal comfort, was much 
annoyed
at the sound which gave some promise of trouble.

     "Well," muttered the portress, as she rose from before a fire, and
tottered towards the gate, looking through the iron grating for the object
that disturbed her in her meditations and her devotion to the good things 
that
Providence had furnished her with, -- "well, what do you want?"

     "I am a poor travelling broth of the order of St. Francis; I am
benighted, and I wish for a lodging and food."

     "Friend, brother of St. Francis, this is at a later hour than that at
which we open our gates to strangers."

     "They little think at Rome," said the monk, "that, to obtain a shelter,
we have to get to the gates of a holy house before a certain time; and those
who most need shelter, because it is less to be had, must wait and perish in
the cold."

     "The gates are shut."

     "I see it."

     "And the abbess has got the keys."

     "Will she not give me shelter and food?"

     "I may not ask her."

     "I must, then, remain here outside the walls until the morning, and 
then
I will wend my way back to the holy city, where I will say their messenger
could not obtain rest and shelter at the convent here."

     "Do you come form Rome?"

     "I do; and do you refuse to tell your abbess an unworthy brother of 
holy
St. Francis is here, and waiting for admission?"

     The portress made no reply; she was by far to indignant to make any
answer, and yet too fearful to refuse to do his bidding; for he spoke in a
peremptory tone, that indicated an authority beyond what was usual in his
appearance.

     She, therefore, found her way to the lady abbess, to whom she began 
with
every expression of submission and respect.

     "My lady," said the portress, "there is one without who wants to come
in."

     "Well," said the abbess, "we can't let him in."

     "I told him so," replied the portress; "but you would hardly credit it
what he said about a holy pilgrim from Rome, stopping outside the gate all
night, and returning to the holy city and speaking of our inhospitality."

     "Did he," said the abbess, "say so much?"

     "He did."

     "Then let him in," said the abbess.

     "Let him in!" said the portress, in an extacy of surprise, opening her
eyes very wide, and repeating the words "Let him in."

     "Yes; do as we bid you," said the abbess.

     "Yes," replied the portress, "certainly; whatever our holy superior
orders, it is for me to obey.  I do your bidding."

     Away went the holy portress to discharge her spleen in privacy; and, at
the same time, unable to account for the orders given her, she returned to 
the
portal, and having unbarred the gate, she drew the bolts and turned the 
lock,
and opening the door, stood for the monk to enter.

     "Come in," she said.  "What do you mean? -- do you not want to come 
in?"

     "Am I free to enter?"

     "Wherefore do I hold the gate open-- for pleasure?"

     "No, sister," said the monk, "through anger, I believe; but if you can
find it in your conscience to be angry because I am at the door and give you
this trouble, what will be the feelings of St. Peter, who keeps the gates of
Heaven, when you present yourself thereat a hungry being and erring sinner;
but peace be upon this place."

     "Amen," said the portress.

     At that moment one of the nuns came from the superior of the convent,
saying, --

     "Holy father, when you have rested and refreshed yourself, our worthy
abbess will be glad to converse with you."

     "I am even now at her commands," said the holy man.

     "Will you not tast food, and rest yourself?"

     "I never tire or need food, when I have aught to do that in any way
concerns our religion."

     "But, holy father, the body needs refreshment."

     "It can be supported upon spiritual food alone, if the Lord wills," 
said
the monk, crossing himself most devoutly.

     "You must have great gifts, holy father!"

     "Not I, but he that sent me," said the monk, solemnly.

     "Will you follow me, holy man, and I will lead you to the abbess, who
will be right glad to speak with you?"  She wishes to speak to one lately 
come
from the holy city; you can tell her news of the holy father."

     "I can, my sister."

     "Then, come this way," said the nun, who immediately led the way to the
abbess, and the monk followed her closely, till he was lost sight of by 
those
in the waiting-room.

 Next Time: Father Francis's Interview with the Abbess of St. Mary Magdalen.
 -- The Objects and Wishes of the Holy Father.

                               [Chapter 161]

FATHER FRANCIS'S INTERVIEW WITH THE ABBESS OF ST. MARY MAGDALEN. -- THE
OBJECTS AND WISHES OF THE HOLY FATHER.


     After passing through a few passages, they entered into a room which 
had
the appearance of a waiting-room, in which were placed chairs and seats; but
they did not stop here, for the sister approached a door, at which she
knocked, and paused a moment; but a voice from within desired her to enter;
and, beckoning the monk to follow her, which he did, they both entered a
comfortable room in which the abbess was seated.

     "Here is the holy father," said the sister, "who demands lodging and
refreshment; but he will take nothing until he has done all that may be
required of him."

     "Holy brother," said the abbess, "the traveller needs rest, and he that
is hungered requires food.  Will you partake of our hospitality?"

     "I was told you desired to converse with me, and I could not let my
ministry wait while I, like a glutton, ate and drank."

     "No, brother, it was not for such a purpose I sent for thee, but to 
hear
what news thou hadst from Rome, whence I heard you have come."

     "I have come thence."

     "But will you not take some refreshment here-- it shall be brought 
thee,
if thou wilt have it, or in the buttery, which you please."

     "Whichsoever you please, sister," said the member of St. Francis.

     "Then let some of the best be brought, sister, for the good man; and
stay, I ate none at the last meal, which I may amend now; let me have a 
small
moiety of a pasty, and a samll trifle of cold venison."

     The sister departed, and the abbess opened a small cupboard, from which
she took a bottle and two glasses, of goodly dimensions, considering the 
fact
that the place was inhabited only by females.

     "Pronounce a blessing upon us, holy father," said the abbess.  "This 
has
been tasted by no unhallowed lips; it was a present from a holy lady to me, 
to
take myself, and to offer to such as I deemed worthy of it-- and you, holy
father, I believe are worthy."

     The worthy monk pronounced the required benediction, and drank as fine 
a
glass of real Burgandy as ever went down consecrated lips.

     "Thanks, worthy sister, thanks."

     "Brother, I am glad to be able to give it thee; it gives me more 
pleasure
to do so than thee to drink.  I'll warrant me, that never has such wine 
passed
through the merchants' hands, because he would never have parted with it at 
a
price that would have made it procurable in a place like this, for we are, 
holy
brother, poor, very poor."

     "The people who live in these parts are, I fear, not so godly as they
should be, to let a house like this want."

     "There are many nobles."

     "And they ought to pay handsomely."

     "They do, I am thankful; but I should like to be able to offer the 
poor,
diseased, and helpless men, better sort of diet than I do."

     "It ought to be in your power when the rich and great are so close 
around
you here.  You ought to have rich penitents."

     "But few of the rich are penitent, brother."

     "Naples I was told was a sink of iniquity.  I did not expect to find it
in reality such as I have heard it described.  But, sister, we must be
thankful that we have what the times will afford; but, at the same time,
whent he enemy is thus about, we must be up and doing, and preach salvation 
to
them."

     "But they only answer by sending invitations for Sabbath balls," said 
the
unfortunate abbess, in great dolour.

     "That must be looked to.  They must be chidden."

     "And then they withhold their hands from works of charity-- from doing
any good deed to us-- and we have no gifts and offerings."

     "But that ought not to be any motive.  When they see you in earnest, 
they
will not resist any longer; they will, as they must, give in."

     "Ah, holy father! you don't know the Neapolitans; they are the most
sinful set of men that you ever met with."

     "The holy father must know of this; he must be informed of the 
character
of these bad people-- of these facts.  It is a melancholy state of things,
which is a disgrace to a Christian country, and must be amended."

     At that moment the nun returned with the refection for the monk and the
abbess, who cast a longing glance towards it.

     When this was laid on the table, the abbess gave a signal that there 
was
no need of the further attendance of the servitor, who quitted the room,
leaving the abbess and the monk to enjoy each others society at leisure.

     Some minutes elapsed before either spoke, which time was spent in
mastication of no ordinary morsels, being some of the most delicious meats 
that
could be obtained for a religious house of this character, and they were
usually supplied with the best of everything that could be had.

     "Holy father," said the abbess, "the fare is poor; but I hope it will
relieve those calls which imperious nature demands you to satisfy."

     "Yes," said the monk; "I am well satisfied."

     "Permit me to press upon your notice those venison pasties; they are 
made
by Sister Bridget, who never made an indifferent one in all her life."

     "I decidedly approve of Sister Bridget's skill," said the monk.  "She 
is
no doubt a worthy woman, and a woman fit for her station."

     "I would not have another to do her duties for a trifle, save as a
penance," said the abbess.  "I will, at all events, retain her while the
convent will give her a place of shelter."

     "Very right, sister-- very right."

     "But what news from Rome, brother?"

     "Little, save the holy pontiff has been very ill."

     "I heard as much; and by many it is presumed that his holiness will be
translated, if he should not be better soon."

     "No: his holiness is safe, as far as it is possible for any human being
to be.  God preserve him long!"

     "Amen!" said the abbess, devoutly.

     "But have you no penitents, holy sister?"

     "I have several, but they are all in the way of performing their
penances, save one, who is somewhat refractory, holy father, and I know not
what to do with her.  She has no respect for those in authority."

     "Is she one of the order?"

     "No, a neophite."

     "How is it, then-- what brings her here?"

     "She is sent by relatives who are afraid of a disgrace, and will not 
give
her any chance of committing their family to such a disgraceful marriage.  
She
at one time pledged herself to take the vows, but now has some objection to 
do
so."

     "On what grounds does she refuse?"

     "Because she thinks she shall not be happy."

     "Absurd!  Where is she?"

     "We must have been compelled to secure her, for she has made more than
one attempt to escape, and I have reasons to believe that these efforts have
been aided from without."

     "'Tis a serious offence-- a very serious offence to those concerned, 
and
would inevitably lead to a terrible example, if they were detected."

     "No doubt; and we should feel it our duty to make every exertion to
punish any one who makes an attempt to violate the sancity of our house."

     "It must be so, sister."

     "Yes, certainly; and I have secured the maiden, who, if she be brought 
to
their mind, will largely endow the convent."

     "That ought to be seen to."

     "I am, as you may imagine, holy father, anxious that the young maiden
should become a member of our house.  Who can tell," muttered the abbess, 
half
aloud, "but she may become a chosen vessel by which much good may be
effected?"

     "She may," said the monk.  "I am from Rome; you may examine the these
credentials which I have with me.  I will take the charge of this refractory
sister of yours, and will pursue such a course as will bring her round to 
your
way of thinking."

     "And the endowment?"

     "Will still belong to your house, to which it will be given.  I have no
object, sister, save the welfare of the church; reward I seek not, save what
may be given in the good words of the wise and good."

     "You are deserving of all praise, holy father.  I was not thinking 
about
the endowment, holy father, because, you see, it will not belong to me, but 
to
the church, and this house in particular, for the use of the poor lambs 
here,
over whom I am appointed shepherdess; so I have no feeling in the matter
beyond what I ought to have in the spiritual welfare of our fellow sinners."

     "I have no authority to interfere in aught else."

     "I see, holy father," said the abbess, "you are a wonderful man, and 
such
a one as will do much good."

     "I will make an attempt to do good, sister."

     "And I will make bold, holy brother, to say you will be successful;
though, I venture to say, with humility, that I have tried everything with 
the
unfortunate young woman, which appears to aggravate the evil, rather than 
give
any promise of the future."

     "So I might expect."

     "You will pursue a different course?"

     "I may; but it must depend upon circumstances.  If I find it necessary, 
I
must have some place of security, where no one can have any communication 
with
her, save when I shall order it, or deem it proper she should be so 
confined."

     "Certainly; very right."

     "Moreover, if I find she needs such severe measures, I shall not let 
any
food be given, save what is given by me, or in my presence, which, of 
course,
amounts to the same thing."

     "Exactly, holy father."

     "And," continued the monk, "I will not permit this holy house to be
insulted by a recusant, for I am quite resolved that no heretick shall 
baffle
the ministers of religion."

     "Oh, very improper; it would be indeed, not only an aggravation, but a
decided loss to the church, which would damnify it to that extent."

     "Undoubtedly," replied the holy man, "undoubtedly; and with your aid I
hope to be able to make one good effort, and I pray heaven it may be 
attended
with grace."

     "I trust so; and now, holy brother, what may I call you?"

     "You will see by these presents I am called Father Francis, of the 
order
of St. Francis; and unworthy brother, who has, perhaps, beyound his gifts,
obtained the praise and good wishes of his holiness the Pope, who has been
pleased specially to send me forth on a travelling commission, to report to
him and to stay where I thought my services might be required."

     "Holy father, we may have you stay here some time, I hope, and your
favourable report of our poor endeavours; they are in the right direction, 
and
carried on with the right spirit; but we are all weak and erring mortals, we
cannot always be as successful as we would wish, and in this matter we have
been unsuccessful."

     "You have done all that could be expected; there are some matters that
will not yield to the weaker vessel, but which would yield to the stronger;
therefore you have nothing to blame yourself with; but you are to be 
commended
for what you have done."

     "Thanks, holy father; I would not be willingly found wanting."

     "Nor are you, sister, according to my poor judgment."

     "And when will you see this neophite?"

     "I will see her on the morrow; and in the meantime I must be chargable 
to
you for board and lodging, if you will so far grace me."

     "Name it not, holy father; I have nothing here but what is yours; and
when you choose to retire, there will be the best traveller's bed ready for
you."

     "Straw and sackcloth are good enough for me," said the monk,
ostentatiously.

     "But it concerns our housekeeping, holy father, and our hospitality 
too.
We must not let you lodge thus.  I pray you, for our sakes, permit us to do
what the credit of the place will permit us to do in the way of
entertainment."

     "Be it even as you will, sister; it does not beseem me that I should
contend for matters like these-- be it so; I will retire."

     "It grows late.  I will summon Sister Agatha to show you your 
dormitory."

     Accordingly, Sister Agatha was summoned, and the monk was, after 
another
delicate libation of rich Burgandy, led to his room.

 Next Time: The Cell of the Neophite. -- The Interview. -- The Unexpected 
Turn
 Given to the Affairs at the Convent of Mary Magdalen.




                             CHAPTER CLIV. [sic]

                               [Chapter 162]

THE CELL OF THE NEOPHITE. -- THE INTERVIEW. -- THE UNEXPECTED TURN GIVEN TO
THE AFFAIRS AT THE CONVENT OF MARY MAGDALEN.


     The morning broke, and the matins were duly performed at St. Mary
Magdalen.

     This was what happened every day in the week included, for the convent
was always alive to the perfomance of its duties from the dawn of day until
sunset and after; but it was their business-- a business from the toil of
which they rested not on the Sabbath.

     But then it happened that there was no labour; it was all easy-going,
straight-forward work, and was a mere pastime, that only occupied the lips
and ears; for not half of it was understood, and the other half had long
since ceased to produce any impression upon the stagnant minds of the mewed-
up
sisterhood.

     However, there was not lack of comfort, especially for those who held 
any
of the good offices in the convent.  The holy Father Francis was met at 
table
by the abbess, who was great and gracious to him.

     "Will you inform the sisterhood, holy sister, of my stay here, lest it
bring any scandal upon your house, the well-being of which is to me of
importance."

     "I have already done so.  I anticipated your wishes on that point, holy
father-- in fact, I did it on my own account, too, for we live in evil 
times--
in very evil times."

     "We do, sister."

     "So that being done, you have but to express your wishes; for of course
they are the wishes deputed of the pope."

     "Certainly-- certainly; it could not be otherwise."

     "I knew," said the abbess; "and now I wait for your wishes; let me know
them, and I will answer for it, that nothing that is desired by his holiness
through you shall meet with any other than the most profound attention and
willing obedience."

     "You are a worthy superior, and if Heaven please to permit me, I will 
not
fail to let his holiness know of all this devotion and obedience; and, not
less, your regularity and religious observances; he will be well pleased, I 
am
sure."

     "Thanks, holy father."

     "Nay, 'tis justice.  But I would now see your unworthy guest."

     "The probationist?  Yes, she can be seen.  She has had her food given 
her
for breakfast, and will be ready to receive you."

     "I am ready, then.  In the meantime, what is her name and designation?"

     "Her name is Juliet, and of a noble house-- that of the famous Di
Napotoloni."

     "Indeed! 'tis very strange."

     "She desired to marry against her friends' wish, who would not hear of
the iniquity that was desired to be perpetrated."

     "I will see her, then.  I may be able to do some good."

     "You cannot fail."

     "I do not know.  The race is not always with the swift, nor the battle
with the strong; but I will essay to try."

     "If you will come this way, holy father, you shall be admitted into her
cell.  Shall I remain, or shall I return?"

     "I will be alone, for I will confess her, and bring her mind to a calm
state.  Then, when I have her confidence, I will begin the object in view, 
and
then we shall find whether there is any probability of that system being
successful."

     "Certainly; but if not?"

     "Why, we must adopt more energetic means, and these we must continue to
pursue until there is an end of hope, or life; for when coercion is once 
begun
we must continue it on without intermission."

     "No doubt-- no doubt, holy father."

     "Have you any others who are in a very similar state to this unhappy
being?"

     "None, holy father, none; but this is her door.  She will be sulky, or
spiteful, as the humour may be; but, at the same time, she will not spare 
me,
because I have, as you see, thus confined her to this place as a 
punishment."

     "You have done right, sister, quite right-- there is no blame."

     The abbess opened the door, and at the same moment they both entered 
the
dungeon in which the unfortunate young female was thrust by the aid of
paternal authority, sanctioned by religious usage, and a presumed right they
had over her actions.

     "This, holy father," said the abbess, "is the unfortunate female whose
case I told you of as being so desperate, that there is no remedy left but
that to which we never resort, save in an extremity, and upon no other
occasion whatever."

     "I see, sister-- I see; but I hope one so young has not been entirely 
won
over to the enemy.  I trust she will not strive against those who strive for
her."

     "This holy man," said the abbess to Juliet; "this holy man has 
travelled
from St. Peter's, at Rome, and has come to examine, with the sanction of his
holiness the Pope, the state of our spiritual existence.  See that you give
good account of yourself."

     "What the lady abbess has stated to you," said Father Francis, "is no
more than the truth.  I am so come, and for such a purpose.  Prepare,
therefore, to confess, and tell me freely what it is that troublest your 
soul.
Confess, daughter."

     The monk drew a stool towards him, and having sat down, he waved his 
hand
towards the abbess, who stood by, saying, --

     "I will hear her confess; we must be alone."

     There was an instant movement on the part of the abbess, and she 
quitted
the cell of the lady, placed the key of the door on the inside, and left 
them
alone.

     "Daughter," said the monk, after awhile, "daughter, what is this I hear
of you?"

     The unfortunate young woman fixed her eyes upon her questioner, and 
took
them not off him during some minutes; and a shudder seemed to pass through 
her
mind.

     "I have spoke to thee," said the monk.

     "You have," answered Juliet.

     "Then answer me."

     "I cannot.  I know not what has been said."

     "Could you not guess?"

     "I might, holy father; but what can that be to such as you?  You must
know that I have been put here according to the abbess's orders."

     "I do know so much, daughter.  What more have you to say?"

     "Simply, that I know not what I am thus confined here for."

     "Since you know it not, I will tell you.  You have disobeyed the 
abbess's
orders-- that is what you are now punished for-- 'tis a heinous offence."

     "I am not yet one of the order, holy father; and, therefore, the abbess
has no right to do this; and if she did not know that my friends were her
abettors, she dare not do it; 'tis a grievous injury, and a deep and 
shameful
wrong.  Instead of religion being, as it ought to be, the safeguard of the
poor and weak against the rich and powerful, it is a means of oppression
against those who have no power."

     "These are hard accusations, daughter."

     "They will bear the proof, however, and that fairly.  Where have I 
taken
the vows? -- where am I the sworn sister? -- tell me that, holy father."

     "I have come for another purpose, daughter; you have been undutiful to
those whom nature and God gave control over you; and you have desired to 
live
disgracefully; surely, these are things that deserve punishment, for they 
are
great moral crimes."

     "I cannot see any such, holy father."

     "I am afraid your soul is in an unclean state, daughter.  There is no
hope for you until this is amended; depend upon it, you can never prosper
while you set at naught the desires of those who rule you."

     "But they have no right to force me to an alternative that my soul
revolts at."

     "You cannot mean you revolt at becoming one of the holy and chaste
sisterhood here? -- that must be a libel upon your chastity."

     "Holy father, it is not the age, nor under the circumstances, at which
such a proposal can be made with any chance of success; for I am quite
confident that I am born with better prospects than those which now threaten
me.  My father and mother had no right to send me here; they led me to 
believe
I should inherit a fortune, and now they desire I should enter a cloister."

     "And you have given them cause to change the original intention they 
had
concerning you; you are disobedient, that is enough."

     "But, holy father, there is a power stronger than a father's or a
mother's-- a power of which the church approves.  What would you more?"

     "What power?"

     "The divine command which says, we shall leave a parent and fly to the
arms of him whom we have chosen to become our husband."

     "The devil can quote scripture when he has any object in view.  But,
Juliet, you are carried away by the strength of your own passion.  This is a
disgraceful marriage, and one you should not contract-- one that would never
be sanctioned by them."

     "It might be so-- that is, unsanctioned by them; but there is no 
disgrace
in being married to a young officer who loved me."

     "And whom you mean really to marry?"

     "Yes."

     "And you would, in fact, marry any one who would offer himself, instead
of being a nun?"

     "I would sooner die-- and I will, by slow starvation-- sooner than 
become
one of this or any other order."

     "I see-- but who was this young man?"

     "Jules di Maestro."

     "How strange-- how passing strange!" said the monk, changing his tone
from one of severity to one of sadness and sorrow.

     "Why, what ails you, holy father?  Has anything happened?"

     "I know not, my daughter, whether to feel most sorrow or most anger; 
but
your case is one that requires some care.  Whether to tell you all, or 
whether
to conceal a part, or-- or-- in fact, to tell the whole and trust to your
goodness."

     "What do you mean-- what do you mean?  Your manner distresses me.  I
cannot understand you at all-- speak, for the love of Heaven!"

     "I can hardly do so, unless, by a solemn vow, you promise secrecy."

     "I swear," said the hasty and impatient Juliet.

     "Then listen."

     "I do-- I do.  For Heaven's sake, keep me no longer in suspense!"

     "Well, then, Jules di Maestro and I concocted a plan together, which we
were to execute with the view of getting you out of this convent, so that 
you
might both quit the kingdom of Naples, and get into some of the free 
states."

     "Oh, dear Jules! and did he really take so much trouble about me-- did 
he
really mean to do so much?  I can never be grateful enough to him."

     "Why, you remember his last attempt?"

     "I heard of it; but it did not succeed, But it must be two months 
ago.["]

     "It was.  We both were present."

     "Both!  You?"

     "Yes; I was present, and wounded in the affray, though not so bad as 
poor
Maestro."

     "Hurt! but he has got over that, else you would not come here from him 
to
plan another escape, which I see you have.  I am truly sorry for his hurts;
but he is, no doubt, well again."

     "Stay-- stay-- you are much to sanguine."

     "He has not forgotten me?"

     "No; but you must permit me to speak.  I am quite sure that had you 
heard
the whole of the affair, you would not speak in this strain; for had I known
that I had to tell you unwelcome news, I would not have undertaken this
affair, even urged as I have been by him and your beauty."

     "What mean you?"

     "Why, that Jules is dead.  He died within a few days after the last
attempt that he made to rescue you from your captivity."

     "What, do I hear aright!  Jules dead!  Great God, impossible-- quite
impossible!  Nothing so dreadful can be real."

     "I am sorry to say it is so," said the monk; "very sorry."

     "But how did it fall out?" asked Juliet, who appeared to be too much
stunned to feel anything acutely; "tell me how."

     "When we made our last attempt to get you out, it failed; for we were
both compelled to defend ourselves, and to fly before a numerous body of 
men.
I should have got clear of them, but I saw that Jules was made prisoner, so 
I
charged and rescued him from their hands."

     "It was nobly done of you."

     "Then, you see, I got some marks that I could not help; there were too
many; but poor Jules got mortally wounded."

     "Heaven be merciful to him!"

     "I hope so; but he was not killed immediately.  I got him quite away
without any one being able to tell who he was, but that was an effort that
cost me much.  I took him away, as I said, and I sat by his side when he
breathed his last breath."

     "And what said Jules?" inquired Juliet, as she shed many bitter tears.
"What said he? did he not curse her who had caused him such an end?"

     "No, no; Jules did not; he wept when he knew his wounds were mortal, 
not
because he was to die, but because he must leave you here, and you would be
for ever ignorant of his fate; that is what most affected him, I assure 
you."

     "Ah! he was of a noble, generous nature."

     "I, however, promised him that I would see you, and let you know how 
the
matter had stood with him; and he gave you his last blessing, and desired me
not to tell your family that he was dead, as it would be a triumph for them;
at the same time he wished, if possible, I could supply his place to you in
his stead."

     "No, no," said Juliet; "no, no; that can never be.  I loved Jules, and
can never love any one else, and will never try.  No, no; Jules and Jules
only, will I live for!"

     "But he is dead."

     "Then for him will I die, too; he died for me, and I will for him."

     "But his last words were to me-- 'Go and see Juliet, tell her truly how 
I
died, and what my last wishes were.  Those I have formed with the full 
belief
that they are for her benefit.  I know how she is placed-- without a friend,
and in danger.'"

     "Yes, yes; now I have no one to help me."

     "You have me, if you choose."

     "Not at the price you spoke of."

     "But you know not how clearly he expressed himself upon the matter; he
knew the life you lead then-- what it will be by and by-- you know the
starvation which you will have to feel, and, perhaps, be built up in a wall
after all."

     "Oh, God!"

     "He said, 'See, and tell her you have nearly lost your life in serving
me, and in serving her; that I am under an obligation to you for saving my
life more than once.  Thus, Juliet is the last word I pronounced, and the 
last
I thought of-- but if I had a legacy to leave you,' he said, 'I would leave
her, and die happy if I thought you would enable her to escape.  Marry her,
and keep all the world at defiance-- then, indeed, I could be happy-- almost
as happy as if I lived to be in your happy position.'

     "'I will,' I replied; 'I will endeavour to obtain her escape.'

     "'Will you swear?'

     "'I do swear,' I replied; 'and at the same time I will risk my life, 
and
lose it, if she will accept of me for a husband; but I cannot for less.'

     "'You have said enough,' he replied; 'I am satisfied.'"

     "And he died?" said Juliet.

     "Yes; he died; but I have been long enough.  I will see you again 
before
another day is past, and then I will learn your determination.  Do not let 
my
cause be rejected because I have not urged it forward as I could have done;
but the truth is, it is an honest one, and it will speak for itself.  
Farewell
for the present; be secret and silent.  They think me monk, for I have 
assumed
this disguise, at the peril of my life, which will be taken with cruel 
tortues
if I am discovered."

     There was a pause, when the monk resumed again, --

     "If you can consent to become my wife by this time to-morrow, I will
endeavour to free you from bondage."

     "Why purchase the motive to a good action?"

     "I do not do so.  I only purchase a right which, if risk of life, and 
all
that man hold dear, be anything, why, you will not think me a Jew in the
bargain.  Think, lady, think upon what I have offered you."

     "I do think; but 'tis a hard bargain for me to lose my liberty either
way."

     "Nay, you gain it, for you would be my mistress.  But, hark! here comes
the abbess.  I must bid you adieu."

     "How fares the penitent?" inquired the abbess, entering.

     "I cannot gain either a satisfactory or an unsatisfactory answer to 
your
inquiry.  I will, however, see her to-morrow again, and if I find she is
obdurate, perhaps the shortest way will be an application to the 
inquisition."

     "Think of that, daughter," sadi the abbess, leaving the cell.

     "Think of that," added the monk, "as your means of leaving the cell-- 
of
escaping.  Farewell, daughter.  Benedicite."

THE NUN'S ATTEMPTED ESCAPE FROM THE CONVENT OF ST. MARY MAGDALEN. -- THE
PURSUIT AND THE DISCLOSURE. -- THE ESCAPE OF THE PRETENDED MONK.


     The next day all Naples was alive to the fact that a holy man had been
murdered in the wood Del Notti -- a holy brother of teh order of St. 
Francis,
who was much respected by the good people of Naples.

     Jose and Fiametta both attended before the municipal authorities to 
give
the required information they had give the monk gold to remain by the side 
of
the dead man whom Jose had killed.

     There was a general terror throughout Naples, for no one was aware of
how the matter had fallen out, nor how the enormity would be punished, and 
who
would be the sufferers in the present case.

     The officers of the state were in active search after the perpetrator 
of
so wicked a deed -- as well as the officers of the inquisition.

          *             *             *             *             *

     The next time Father Francis called at the convent, he went straight to
the lady abbess, and said to her with some earnestness, --

     "I am sorry to tell you, the more I reflect upon the conversation I had
with your neophite Juliet, I have some strong doubts about the course I
originally thought of pursuing towards the young person."

     "In what respect, holy father?"

     "I thought of pursuing a mild course towards her."

     "I have done it, and failed."

     "The reason I think is not that she is hardened, but that she simply 
does
not believe we will proceed to the extremity that we have threatened."

     "I think she is hardened, holy father."

     "Time alone will show; but I have altered my plans respecting her."

     "In what respect, holy father?"

     "I think I will begin to strike terror into her soul, and at once shew
her the reality of my intentions, with respect to what I shall subject her 
by
way of punishment for her resistance to her religious superiors."

     "Very good, holy brother; I think it the plan that will most likely
succeed the best; if she be terrified, she will be obedient."

     "And to that end," said the monk, "I have ordered the alguazils of the
inquisition to be here in half an hour's time, when she will be carried 
there,
and subjected to the first process of torture."

     "You will not hurt her?"

     "Not much."

     "Just enough to teach what powers you can exert."

     "Yes, just so.  Now, when they come, let me know, and, if she consents 
to
go, all well and good; and, if she do not, we must use force."

     "And how long will you keep her at the inquisition?" inquired the 
abbess;
"because, eventually, the parents will claim her of me."

     "About three weeks, at the farthest; but, if the parents are 
troublesome,
name the inquisition, and say holy brother Francis, from Rome, will come and
confess them, and make some inquiries concerning their belief and faith in 
the
church."

     "I will, holy father."

     The monk now returned to the cell where the unfortunate Juliet was
confined, and, on opening the door, he found her in tears.

     "Juliet," he said, "I come again."

     "You are here;" she replied, "I see."

     "And I am here with all the means of escape; you have but to say the
word, and you are free and at liberty."

     "I cannot-- I cannot."

     "You cannot.  Do you love life-- do you love liberty?"

     "I do."

     "And yet you choose the cold, bare walls of a cloister, to a life of
happiness and love; to a life that is made for such as you."

     "I cannot love you."

     "I love you; that I have risked my life for you more than once, is 
true;
my persecution is another proof of that."

     "It may be so."

     "Then why not consent? you have no alternative that can interest you
more, or that will offer you more happiness."

     "I cannot so soon forget Jules."

     "Nay, we will not quarrel about that; I cannot expect you.  I am not
unreasonable, beause I know so well the circumstances of the case.  All is
haste and confusion; there is no time for thought or preparation-- all lies 
in
self-preservation; say at once you will have me; I will endeavour to gain 
your
love and esteem afterwards; our happiest days, our courting-time will come
after our wedding."

     "It cannot come."

     "But will you choose the horrors of the inquisition rather than wed one
who would give life and fortune to you?"

     "Who speaks of the inquisition?" inquired Juliet, terrified.

     "The abbess spoke to me about it when I came here last time, and said 
she
had your father's commnds to deliver you over to them."

     "I'll not believe it."

     "I entreated her not to do so, but to leave it in my hands, and I would
undertake to communicate with the inquisition, and bring their officers here
to-day."

     "And have you?"

     "I have brought those who will counterfeit them, and carry you off.  
The
plan is matured.  Will you leave this place, wed me, and be a happy woman, 
or
remain here to be tortured and disfigured by the tortures of the 
inquisition--
perhaps to die in their hands?"

     "Horrible!" said Juliet, with a shudder.

     "Think on this and on that."

     At that moment a tremendous uproar occurred in the convent, and a 
ringing
of bells.  The pretended monk started, and listened attentively.

     "They come," he muttered -- "they come!"

     "Have they discovered you?" inquired Juliet.

     "I know not-- I care not if they have.  Will you quit the convent, and
leave Naples with me?  Will you become my wife?  You see what I have risked
for you.  I wait but your answer: they are coming."

     Before any answer could be given, the door was thrown open, and the
abbess, followed by a troop of soldiers, entered the cell, and, among them,
the vampire monk saw his late adversary, Jose, and his love, Fiametta.

     "There is the murderer," said Jose, pointing to the monk, whose cowl 
had
fallen off; "and he is the man whom I believed I had killed."

     "Oh, yes, it is the same horrid face!" said Fiametta.

     "The murderer of Father Francis?" said the abbess.

     "I know not how it was done; but I told Father Francis to watch and 
pray
by the dead body, and see it decently buried, and he said he would do so.  I
gave him gold, and left him at his watch and his devotions."

     "And he is dead now-- his cassock and papers torn from him."

     "Seize him, comrades!" said the officer.

     At the sound of the officer's voice, Juliet looked up, and beheld her
lover, Jules di Maestro, whom she was told had been killed.  She sprang up,
saying, --

     "It is all false, then.  You are not slain-- you are still living-- and
you did not send this man to marry me?"

     "I-- who-- Oh!  Juliet, have I found you?"

     "I am here, dear Jules.  Take me hence-- take me hence!"

     "I will not do so now; but I have their majesties' favour, and will 
take
care you shall be released from this vile durance."

     "And that man----"

     "Ay, look to your prisoner," said the officer.

     But there was no prisoner to look to.  He had slipped off his cowl and
cassock, and left the convent, leaving all present immersed in their own
affairs.  The abbess was indignant at the imposture, and would not risk
Jules's appeal, on behalf of Juliet, to the king, and at once consented to 
her
release and immediate marriage; and at the same time Fiametta consented to 
wed
Jose, so that all was forgotten, save the murder of the holy Father Francis,
and the resurrection of the vampire monk, who was, in reality, no other than
Sir Francis Varney, who was no more heard of in Naples, but supposed to roam
about the world at large.

 Next Time: The Storm. -- A Shipwreck at Sea. -- The Hapless Fate of the
 Mariners.




                              CHAPTER CLVI. [sic]

                               [Chapter 164]

THE STORM. -- A SHIPWRECK AT SEA. -- THE HAPLESS FATE OF THE MARINERS.


     The morning was ushered in with wind and rain; a tempest was howling 
over
the main; the seas lashed the shores with a fury that made it dangerous for
even such vessels as were moored; and great fears were entertained that many
wrecks would be seen before the night set in.  The roar of the ocean and the
bellowing of the wind was almost deafening; and the few fishermen and 
sailors
that now and then showed themselves; as they came towards the shore to
ascertain the safety of their little barques, could scarcely make themselves
heard.

     The sky was too heavy, and the rain too incessant, to permit them to 
see
very clearly or very far; they could not see any ships in the offing.

     "Neighbour," said one, "did you hear the wind in the night?"     
     
     "Hear it!" replied the man spoken to; "could I help it?  Who is there
that could sleep, while such a tempest was blowing great guns.  I never 
heard
anything like it in all my life.  God help those poor fellows who are at sea
such a night as this."

     "So say I, neighbour, so say I; if there be any upon this coast-- if 
any
awake with the morning dawn and find themselves upon a lee shore, they will
never get off again, depend upon it; they are all lost men."

     "So they are; there's no hope for them on this shore; every vessel 
must,
indeed, come upon it, and no aid could be rendered to them."

     "You are right, neighbour.  I am glad our boats are high and dry; for, 
if
they were not, they would never be on the sea again, except as fragments;
every timber in them would be broken to pieces, and scattered about the
beach."

     "Ay, ay, 'tis an awful day.  I propose, neighbour, we should make an
attempt to get our boats still higher on the beach; see, the sea comes now
within a few boat-lengths of them; a few more waves heaving one upon the 
other
will at last reach them, and, if so, we are, indeed, poor men, neighbour."

     "With all my heart; we have no time to lose, neighbour-- see, the waves
have got nearer yet-- come on, come on."

     The two fishermen hurried down to the beach; and, with the aid of one 
or
two more, who had hurried onwards with the same object as themselves, that 
of
putting the boats out of danger from the waves, they succeeded; and then 
they
returned, leaving their boats, their only wealth, high above the reach of 
the
most tempestuous sea.

     "There, neighbour, I never heard such a sea.  I will go and see what 
can
be done in-doors by the fire-side; this is not a day to be out in; you are 
wet
through in about ten minutes, and nothing to do but to look on the black
clouds."

     "No, neighbour; though I don't think in-doors much better, for I expect
our roof to come off, or the chimney to fall over; and must consider myself
very fortunate if I do not have the whole house blown down."

     "Ay, ay; but I expect to hear of a few accidents.  I don't see any 
vessel
coming in the horizon at all-- do you see any?"

     "None."

     "Well, I hope there may be none.  I'm for the house; too much of this 
may
be hurtful to a fisherman; so, good day."

     "Good day, for the present.  I dare say we shall see each other before
the day's out, if anything may happen in the shape of wreck."

     "Safe and sure to be out."

     "If you hear a gun, let me know, if I should not be out; for the wind
blows and the sea roars so loudly that I can scarcely hear at all."

     "I'll be with you; and do you the same for me, if I should happen to 
miss
it; though I can't tell how that can be, as the wind blows dead in shore."

     "It's a bargain-- I'll do it."

     The two fishermen parted from each other, and entered their own 
dwellings
to escape the fury of the elements; for there was nothing to keep them
outside, but there was everything to induce them to stay in-doors -- a warm
fire and freedom from the wind and rain, though that howled and roared in 
the
chimneys in a frightful manner.

          *             *             *             *             *

     If the aspect of the affairs was bad on the land, it was much worse at
sea; for there a vessel rode out the fury of the storm gallantly enough, and
resisted the force of the winds and waves for some time; but she could not
resist the impetuosity of the elements, though she strove hard and resisted
long.

     She strained, and timber after timber started, masts were gone, and the
rudder became damaged, and at length no hope was left.

     The crew was not a large one, and the pumps had become completely 
choked
and useless; while the vessel was drifted hither and thither without any 
means
of guidance whatever; she was at the mercy of wind and waves.

     "We are drifting towards the shore," said the mate to the master; "we
cannot keep her head out to sea at all."

     "I know it," answered the master, gloomily -- "I know it; she has been
making land for some time now, and as we have neither rudder, nor sails, nor
masts, we may as well make our peace, for the worst must soon come."

     "I expect that some tiem ago, when I found that the wind was set dead 
on
shore, and the rudder was gone."

     "Surely, we haven't much time to lose; let the guns be fired, as a 
signal
of distress; it may give warning to those on shore."

     "We cannot expect assistance."

     "Not here, I know."

     "Certainly not; no boat would live for a moment in a sea like this."

     "No, I know it would not; but it may put them upon the look out, and 
some
of our poor fellows may get picked up; for we don't exactly know how far we
may be driven towards the land, and we may be sent right on to the beach, 
for
aught we can tell."

     "So we might."

     "I hope we may."

     "Are the guns ready?"

     "Yes, sir, they are loaded; but there is only one barrel of powder 
dry."

     "Let it be cared for; fire the guns."

     The order was promptly obeyed, for the men had left off pumping,
conceiving it useless to continue it any longer; indeed; they could not, for
the pumps were no longer serviceable, and they saw the land ahead, and each
man made up his mind that the struggle for life was about to commence; while
the firing of the guns was a measure of precaution which might, or might 
not,
be of use; and as every one clung to hope to the last, the order was obeyed
with alacrity.

     The guns were fired in minute intervals, and at length every half 
minute
while the powder lasted, and then they ceased.

     There was not more than from fifteen to twenty souls on board; but 
there
were several passengers among them; one in particular was remarkable for his
height, and the singular pallid hue of his features.

     He was reserved, but of gentlemanly deportment; he was well aware of 
his
danger, but it did not appear to render him incapable of seeing and
understanding what was going on; but he was grave and melancholy.

     "How long, captain, do you think it will be," he said, approaching the
master, "before the vessel will break up; for I see that we shall be 
wrecked,
that is no secret at all to any of us, and certainly not to me."

     "I don't know, replied the captain; "it is impossible to say."

     "Cannot you form an opinion upon the subject?" inquired the stranger.

     "I can; but it is only an opinion.  I can give you no information,"
replied the captain, who did not wish to give an opinion upon such a 
subject.

     "Certainly, I am aware of that.  I asked for an opinion; if you have 
one,
perhaps you may be good enough to favour me with it, if it be not too great 
a
favour to expect from you, sir.  I thought you had experience enough to 
enable
you to form an opinion, and it was for that reason I asked you."

     "Well, sir, we strike in five minutes, perhaps in twenty; it depends 
upon
wind and waves, our course, and how far we may go ashore."

     "I understand you; if we are forced in upon the shore in a direct line,
we may expect the shortest time."

     "We may."

     "And if we should not meet with any obstruction, we may be thrown far 
on
shore."

     "Yes; if we had but the means of guiding the vessel, I could steer her
within fifty or a hundred yards of the shore, where she would strike, and a
better chance would then be had of some reaching the shore."

     "Which is now rather more than uncertain."

     "It is so," said the master.

     At the moment there was such a shock from the vessel striking upon a
sunken rock, that they were all thrown down on the deck, and the sea made a
clear breach over her, and swept away several of the crew.

     The master contrived for a moment or two to secure himself to a spar,
with the hope that he would be able to float off; but this was a vain hope,
for a moment after he was lifted up by a sea, and dashed against the stump 
of
the mast, and crushed in a horrible manner, his blood dying the deck for a
minute, and then it was washed away, as he himself was by the same wave, and
was not seen again.

     The master no doubt had been killed, and there was nearly all of the 
crew
swept away; but among those who yet survived, was to be seen the tall
stranger, who stood in the storm, and held on by a portion of the vessel; he
still braved the fury of the waves as they broke over the deck clearing all
before them.

     Each breach of the sea made away with some one of the unhappy mariners
who yet clung with hopeless desperation; but yet they feared to quit their
last hold, and to throw themselves into the foam that was boiling around 
them.

     In the meantime the vessel heeled about, and every now and then, being 
in
shallow water, a great wave would come and lift her up, and then leave her
higher on the rocks, but giving her each time dreadful shocks, and breaking
her keel up.

     The only hope the unfortunate men had, was that some portion of the 
wreck
upon which they might chance to be, would be floated to the shore before 
life
was extinct; but this was more and more hopeless, for the breakers over 
which
they would have to float would probably be their destruction, for they would
be dashed to pieces.

     The wind and the waves howled and roared, and drowned all noise --
nothing could be heard, and nothing seen, for the waves broke over them so
furiously, and raged so high above them, that they neither could do so, nor
even see the shore.  Nothing but a white sea of foam and spray met their 
eyes,
whenever they cold raise them, and free them from salt water.

     At length an immense wave came rolling towards them; the men shrieked 
as
the flood came onwards.  In a moment afterwards they were lifted up, vessel
and all, and carried a few yards further onwards and then left, with a 
report
that seemed like that of a cannon to them; but they felt the shock, and when
the wave left them, the vessel was no more; a mere mass of boards and other
matters floated about; she had been utterly and entirely destroyed; no 
vestige
of her was left, and nothing but a confused mass of planks was to be seen,
with here and there a human being clinging to them for life.  But, alas! 
their
efforts were vain -- they sank -- they could not sustain the battle with the
waves and the breakers; they were dashed to mummies, and every limb broken 
on
the foaming, raging breakers.

 Breakers from the Shore.

                               [Chapter 165]

THE FISHERMEN. -- THE DESPAIRING CRY OF THE MARINERS. -- THE BREAKERS FROM 
THE
SHORE.


     On shore the day wore away; the wind blew furiously, and the oceans
roared to such an extent, that no other sound was audible; and the fishermen
who lived upon the coast kept within doors, knowing that nothing could be 
done
out of doors on such a day; and each one seated by the fire, began to 
recount
some wonderful tale of death and shipwreck, or of happy escapes from the
boiling sea, until noon had long since passed, and the turn of the day 
showed
a decided approach towards evening; but no abatement of the tempest.

     The principal fisherman on the coast, a man whose poverty was less,
rather than his wealth was greater than his fellows, sat by his fireside, 
with
one or two others of his class seated with him.

     "I never saw a worse storm," said one of them.

     "I have," said Massallo, the fisherman.

     "You have?" said one of his comrades, in his turn.

     "I have, I can promise you-- one that blew me upon this coast, where I
have ever since remained, and intend to remain."

     "I have heard you say so; but I never heard the particulars of that
story; it must have been many years ago, I fancy."

     "Yes, it must have been fifteen years ago," said Massallo, speaking;
"fifteen years ago at the very least, if not more than that."

     "Well, I think it must be quite that time; for my old man has been dead
these fourteen years, and he remembered you very well, and used to speak of
you; and, as I thought, you must have known him more than a year."

     "Aye, two."

     "Well, it must, then, have been more than sixteen years ago since you
came here."

     "I dare say it was; very nearly seventeen years ago, now I come to 
think
of it.  The storm, if possible, blew harder, and the waves beat higher than
they do now; the rain was heavier than it rains now; and, in addition to 
all,
the thunder and lightning were tremendous, not a sound could be 
distinguished.
The speaking-trumpet was useless-- no sound issued from it-- all was 
confusion
and danger."

     "It must have been a rare time, certainly."

     "It was a time for devils to be abroad, and not for men; but we were
compelled to pump, and cut away the wreck.  Why, you see, we had been chased
by the Algerines, and we had got nearer to the land than we would have gone,
but for the fact that we desired to escape from a superior and formidable
enemy, who knew no mercy.

     "Yes, the Algerines, if they had spared us, would have made slaves of 
us
for our lives, and there would have been little wisdom in being caught by
them, if we could help it."

     "I should imagine no one would ever do it."

     "Well, that was the cause of our being in shore nearer than we ought; 
but
we noticed that the Algerine sheered off at a moment when there was but 
little
chance of our escaping him; but we could not tell the reason; but we 
concluded
that he saw some danger, of which we were at that moment ignorant.

     "Well, we had not time to haul out a little before we were surprised by 
a
tremendous clap of thunder and lightning, as vivid as if it had been brought
from all quarters of the world, and loosened at one and the same moment."

     "It must have added to your terrors."

     "It was the main thing that wrecked us on this coast."

     "What, the lightning! why, I suppose it struck you, then?"

     "Yes; we could have held off, or run the vessel bump ashore-- almost
dry-- but we lost all commnad over her, when the lighting shivered our mast 
to
atoms and left the stump burning in the vessel; then, more than that, it
killed two of our best hands at that moment, and most of us were knocked up
and unable to work at the pumps; but it was of no use; we came ashore, crash
went the vessel, and we were all in the boiling sea in an instant, and a 
wave
or two more threw me on the beach, without any fatal injury, and I scrambled
up out of their reach."

     "And then you remained by us."

     "Yes; I did not find means to return whence I came for some years."

     "Perhaps you had reason."

     "I had; I was a rival for a girl; I was then endeavouring to win money; 
I
had entrusted some money in the vessel-- all I had; and with her I lost all,
and with that all I lost even hope, and never returned to my native home."

     "Did the girl love you?"

     "She liked me well enough to have me, if her relations would consent, 
but
they would not, unless they saw I had more money than I could obtain; and, 
in
default of that, they would marry her to another, who had more money than I;
and I only obtained time to get money by the girl's intercession; but I was
baulked."

     "Well, that was bad; but I suppose you were well assured that you would
be rejected if you had not money."

     "I was, by her family."

     "And herself----"

     "That was not so sure; and yet they had great influence upon her; but I
could not have the courage to go back and ask her to wed poverty; a man
without even the means of purchasing a wedding garment."

     "You did right, neighbour."

     "I did, and I knew it," replied the fisherman, bitterly.

     "But you have prospered since; and you have been happy, if I mistake
not."

     "Yes, I have been prosperous, and tolerably happy; it is wonderful how
men adapt themselves to the circumstances around them."

     "They do; if they did not, how insupportable would life be."

     "You are right; I should have been miserable for ever; I should never
have recovered my feelings, and should never have been what I am now."

     "The storm seems as furious as ever, neighbour," observed one of the
fishermen, after a long pause, for they were meditating upon what they had
heard, "and I think we shall have but a very rough night of it."

     "Good; we shall have a night of it."

     "I think," said another, "I must be getting near my own fireside by 
this
time; they will expect me home, or think some accident has happened."

     "And I will step out to see how the weather looks before it grows dark;
there appears no change."

     "Hark! what is that?"

     There was a moment's pause, and in about a minute, in one of the lulls 
of
the wind, they thought they heard a gun; but the storm increased so as to
leave them in great doubt of what it was.

     "It was a gun, I think," said the fisherman.  "Such sounds as those I
have heard before; but 'tis hard to tell them form the sounds of the
elements."

     "We can tell when we get outside, I dare say; but the wind sweeps all
sounds past so rapidly that it is scarcely possible to tell even there; but
there is yet light to see, and as the sun sets in the horizon, we have a
chance of seeing a sail if there be one."

     "We have, but not of helping her."

     "True; there is no help for those on board."

     "May Heaven have mercy upon the poor mariners," said the fisherman's
wife.  "It is hard times with them now.  Life is dear to all, and they will
cling to it.  Do what you can for the poor beings."

     "There's no doing anything," said the fisherman, gloomily.  "Neither 
boat
nor ship can ride through such a sea, on the ocean or at anchor."

     "But they may be cast ashore, and they may not be quite dead, you know;
instant aid might avail much, when even they had ceased to feel."

     "We will not fail in that particular.  We are going down to the beach
now, and shall not neglect any means that are in our power, at all events;
more we cannot do, but that much shall be done, and I hope it may be of some
service."

     "Hark! the same sound again," said his companion.

     "I did not hear it."

     "Nor I."

     "Come on; we shall now know better in the open air," said the 
fisherman,
as he wrapped himself up in a large rough coat, and pulled his hat over his
eyes.  "The rain is as heavy as ever, and I think it will soon fill the sea 
to
overflowing."

     The fisherman left the hut and proceeded towards the beach; at least,
they did not go down, for the waves ran so high that they beat a long way
inland -- more so than they had ever done before.

     "What do you think of our storm?"

     "It is a complete tempest-- furious; and the wind blows the waves 
towards
the shore, and that is the cause why we have the sea so high; and should the
wind continue in that quarter for a day or two, even our cottages will be in
some danger."

     "I dare say they would; but it would be without example if the winds 
were
to continue in that quarter for so long a time, blowing a complete hurricane
without any intermission.  I should almost think the world about to end."

     "Do you see any vessel out in the horizon?" inquired one of the
fishermen.

     "Not I."

     "But I can hear the gun."

     There came booming across the waters the sound of a piece of artillery.
There was no mistaking it -- it was plain and evident to all that there was 
a
vessel in distress somewhere, but they could not exactly tell where.

     Again the sound reached them on the wind, accompanied by the roar of 
the
elements; but it was enough to distinguish it by from the rest of those 
awful
sounds, which spoke plainly to them of the dreadful fate of the unfortunate
men who were on board the vessel in distress.

     "Can you make them out?" inquired one of the fishermen of his 
companion.
"I cannot see her, though I hear the guns, and can almost imagine her
whereabouts."

     "No, I can't see her," replied the man spoken to.

     "I can though," replied the first fisherman; "she lies close in shore,
not a mile out, nor yet that.  I think she's dismasted."

     "I see her now, myself.  I looked about in the horizon, above her 
there.
She labours much, and the sea breaks over her."

     "She has lost her rudder, I have no doubt, and is drifting right in
shore.  What will become of them, I cannot well think."

     "It is too easy to think."

     "Do you imagine that one man among the whole crew can be saved?"

     "Hardly, on such a shore as this, with rocks on all sides; every man 
that
is swept overboard will be dashed to pieces, and disabled, even if lashed to
spars."

     "You are right; for if one man survives this wreck, it will be a 
miracle,
and I can hardly believe it to be possible."

     They now watched the course of the vessel.  The guns had ceased to 
fire,
and daylight was fast departing; and though she came nearer, yet she became
less distinct; but still they could see her, and note her progress well
through the surf that rose up around her as it dashed against the labouring
vessel's side.

     "She strikes," cried one of the men; "that shivering action is her 
first
shock."

     "Yes," said a companion.  "Poor wretches, they have but a short time 
now.
She will go to pieces on those rocks as sure as they are there."

     "May she not hold together?"

     "No; see, she heaves up again!  No; as there are but bare rocks under
her, and she will not settle into any place, but continue beating and 
bumping
upon them until she will break and split to shivers, not a timber can hold."

     "Too true-- too true," said his companion.

     The fishermen now bent their eyes upon the ocean, where this exciting
scene was going on, but they spoke not.  It was growing yet darker, and yet
they gazed stedfastly, heedless of the beating and overwhelming rain; but 
they
could hardly see the vessel, until at length a loud shriek came to them, 
borne
to them upon the hoarse winds, and heard distinctly above the roaring of the
ocean.

     The fisherman knit his brows, and compressed his lips, as he heard the
sounds, and then, clasping his hands, he said, --

     "Heaven have mercy on them! for I fear the sea will have none.  It's 
all
over, and they are dead and dying.  Follow me!"

 Next Time: The One Body Washed Ashore. -- The First Request. -- The
 Shipwrecked Stranger.




                            CHAPTER CLVIII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 166]

THE ONE BODY WASHED ASHORE. -- THE FIRST REQUEST. -- THE SHIPWRECKED 
STRANGER.


     The fishermen followed down towards the beach, for they had been 
standing
upon some cliffs which commanded the sea below, which now was one dark 
boiling
mass, in which nothing at all was distinguishable; and, therefore, they 
could
not tell what went on below.

     They soon arrived at the little bay, in which their fishing-boats used 
to
ride; but they had been drawn up beyond the reach of the sea, though the sea
now ran quite up into the land, and they stood watching the waves as they
rolled upwards.

     "Had we not drawn our boats higher," said one "they would have been
wrecks by this time, and we should have been beggars."

     "Ay; so we should, neighbour."

     "Don't you see the waves beating over the very spot were they lay?"

     "I do; and they ain't far from them even now, and I am in some fear 
lest
they reach them; but they have been moored as well."

     "They are doubly secured."

     "Do you see anything upon the water yet?" inquired the first fisherman.

     "Nothing."

     "Nor I, and I have strained my eyes to their utmost.  They are most
likely all dashed to pieces, and they are not likely to live through such a
sea."

     "No, no; they must be overwhelmed with water.  God help them, poor
fellows! and if they are not to be saved, may they soon have an end to their
tortures, for the strife after life must be dreadful."

     "It is dreadful," said the other; "but you must know that the 
sufferings
are endured under excitement, and therefore not so much felt as when they 
have
been saved.  To have passed the barrier of life, and to become insensible to
all, and then to be recalled to life, is an agony not to be described.  I 
have
seen men who have been restored to life, and who have solemnly declared that
the pangs of death they could encounter, and not those of a return to life."

     The fisherman made no rply, but stood listening to the howlings of the
storm, and watching the waves; but this was productive of nothing -- they
watched for more than two hours, and yet nothing came ashore.

     "I don't see we can do any good here," said one.

     "Nor I.  Those who were alive, must now have been dead some time."

     "Yes; the sea don't wash them this way."

     "Most likely," added another, "they are washed among the breakers, and
dashed against the cliffs, and therefore cannot reach this place, where they
can reach the land."

     "It usually happens so."

     "It does; but we may as well return.  There is a wreck, no doubt."

     "That is quite settled."

     "Quite, as you say; but there are no signs of it."

     "Save such as you saw."

     "Yes; we have evidence enough of the fact.  We saw her go to pieces, 
and
we have heard the death-shriek of the mariners, and more we cannot have 
seen.
When we come down here in the morning, we may indeed see the bodies, and the
broken and severed planks of the unfortunate vessel, strewn over the sands."

     "I shall return again after I have had an hour or two's turn in," said
the fisherman.

     "Give me a call," said his companion, "and I will go with you."

     "And I."

     "Agreed.  Then about midnight we will again visit the beach, and see if
any of the men are ashore."

          *             *             *             *             *

     There was no one now by the shore, and nought save the sounds of the
turmoil of the elements could be heard.  What other sounds can be any
possibility be distinguishable at such a time?  There was nothing that could
be done there that would sound.  The loud roar of the breakers was 
tremendous;
the dash of the waves against the cliffs, and the steady bellowing of the
wind, which sounded not much unlike a steady and continued report of great
guns fired at a distance, were as but one sound and that sound of a strange,
awful, and furious character -- perfectly dreadful.

     There was one body, however thrown up by the waves, as if they would
yield that one alone, and no other, or as if that one was the only one they
refused to swallow; it floated about for some time, and was thrown hither 
and
thither, now thrown on shore by one wave, and withdrawn by another.

     At last a high wave came rolling onwards, and falling upon the shore, 
it
lifted the body up, and carried it further upon the beach and there left it,
and no subsequent wave came so far as that, and it was left unmolested.

     That body was the carcase of the stranger, who of all the rest had been
swept towards the little bay, and deposited there alone.

          *             *             *             *             *

     The fisherman left his hut to call his companions, and having done so,
they came towards the beach, while they conversed together.

     "Well," said one, "I did not expect to see the storm abate so soon."

     "I did not," replied his companion, "though, I dare say, it was much 
too
violent to last much longer; and yet I can scarcely credit my senses that it
is reallly gone, and that the deluging rain has ceased altogether."

     "Yes; and there comes the moon peeping behind that mass of clouds."

     "The wind blows stiffly yet; but it has greatly moderated, and I think 
it
will continue to do so."

     "I hope it may; but the sea does not abate a bit, and will not for many
hours, even if the wind was to go down."

     "Oh, dear, no; the waves will keep on in this fashion for some hours; 
and
I dare say it will be useless to get our boats out; we shall not have any 
more
fish for some days to come."

     "Most likely not; but I would not venture to go out while the sea is
heaving, after such a storm as this; there would be but little use in doing
so, I am quite persuaded; but what is that yonder?"

     "Where-- I see nothing?"

     "There, lying a few yards from the reach of the waves; to me it looks
like a human body.  It is quite quiet and still-- no motion-- it is, I fear,
dead; there is no motion, and the attitude is that of one who has not moved
after he was thrown there-- I think not, however; but let us see what it 
is."

     The fishermen now went down unto the beach, where the body lay, for 
such
it really was; and, when they reached it, at once saw it was a human body, 
and
they all paused before it.

     "Bring it higher upo on the beach; the waves may come upon you
presently-- they are high enough.  Bring him up higher on the beach, and you
will then see what state he is in; for if his limbs are broken, and his body
otherwise injured to any extent, you may spare much useless labour."

     The fishermen drew the body up higher; they then carried him to a dry 
and
sheltered spot, and examined him, but found no particular injuries to speak
of, but that he was apparently drowned.

     "What course to pursue," said one, "I don't know; no doubt but he is
quite dead; he must have been in the water several hours, besides being
knocked about on the breakers, which is enough to destroy life itself."

     "I should imagine so; and yet, we had better take it up to the cottage,
and place it under cover; indeeed, we cannot tell how long it has been thus;
therefore, I say we had better make some attempt to recover him; he may yet
come round, though there may be but little hope in it."

     "We will try; stand out of the moonlight-- we shall be able to see
presently better what he is, than we can now."

     The moon was now freed from the mass of deep heavy clouds that hung 
over
it, like a curtain before that luminary, and which now shed a brilliant 
light
upon the earth.  The fishermen stood round gazing upon the body of the
stranger.

     "Ha! it moves," said one.

     The body did move, and no sooner did the moonlight fall full and fair
upon its form, than it slowly raised itself upon its elbow, and gazed 
around.
A deep inspiration took place, almost a groan, and some sea water was 
vomited.

     "He lives-- he lives!" exclaimed the fisherman.

     "Take him to the hut," said another.

     They all stooped down to aid him, and began to lift him up.

     "He lives-- he lives!"

     "Away with him to the hut," said several of the fishermen.  "Before a
warm fire, and with some warm drinks, he will get better."

     "A little more light-- a little more light, if you please," said the
stranger, in a bland but broken voice, as he attempted to move his hand.

     "He speaks!" exclaimed the fishermen in a breath, and at the same time
they removed a pace or two, and looked at each other with amazement, and 
then
again at the stranger, who gradulaly rose up, and sat upright in the light 
of
the moon.

     "Are you any better?" inquired one of the men who had looked on in 
silent
amazement, not unmixed with awe, as they gazed.

     "Yes; much better.  What a vile thing is sea water," said the stranger,
turning such a ghastly face upon the men that they shrunk in horror, and yet
they were not men used to fear or any like passion.

     However, they soon approached him, muttering to each other, --

     "What manner of man is this?"

     They did not long consider what was to be done, for one of their number
replied, --

     "Poor fellow! he is not used to the rough usage of the waves, and
therefore does not improve upon their acquiaintance.  But let us lend him a
hand."

     "With all my heart," replied his comrades.

     "Will you come with me to my cottage?" said the fisherman.  "You will
benefit more mby a good fire than by the cold moonlight, I'll warrant.  I
never throve upon night air and wet clothes, and I cannot believe you will."

     "We all know our constitutions best," said the stranger; "but if you 
will
grant me the accomodation you speak of, it will be welcome."

     "Come, lean upon me; never mind your clothes being wet."

     The stranger rose, and, to the amazement of all, he appeared to walk as
well as any of those present; and the only difference was, he was ghastly
pale, and he was dripping with sea water, which left a track after him.

     "Had you been long on the beach?" inquired one.

     "I don't know," replied the stranger.  "I was insensible."

     "Can you form any idea how long you have been in the water?"

     "I really cannot tell even that; for I was insensible immediately after
the ship went to pieces, which she did about the close of the day; and I 
only
remember receiving a hard blow by being struck against a rock, or a piece of
timber, I cannot say which."

     "You must have been insensible for some hours."

     "I dare say I was."

     "I never heard of such a miraculous preservation."

     "Nor I."

     "To come to life, too, without any aid to recover you, that is what
entirely bothers me."

     "Well, they do say, those that are born to be hanged will never be
drowned," added one of the fishermen, in an under tone, to his companion.

     They soon arrived at the hut of the fisherman, in which there was a 
good
fire, and the wife and daughter were ready to do all that could be done for
the unfortunate stranger.

     "You have saved a mariner, then?" said the wife.

     "We have picked up one from the wreck, wife; but we cannot call him a
mariner.  This gentleman was, no doubt, a passenger."

     "Welcome, sir!  I did not expect to see any one alive from the wreck,
much less in condition to walk an speak."

     The stranger paid them some compliments; but contented himself with
sitting by the fire, and being entirely passive in their hands, and 
eventually
retired to rest well wrapped up and warm.

 Next Time: The Fisherman's Cottage. -- The Fireside, and the Traveller's 
Bed.




                             CHAPTER CLIX. [sic]

                               [Chapter 167]

THE FISHERMAN'S COTTAGE. -- THE FIRESIDE, AND THE TRAVELLER'S BED.


     The fisherman's hut was large and roomy.  There was no choice 
furniture,
though there was enough of the homely conveniences that were to be found in
such habitations -- much more so than is usual.  There was a large fire-
place,
upon which some faggots had been newly laid, and which now blazed away most
cheerfully.

     "Our home is humble, sir," said the fisherman; "but such as it is, you
are welcome to it, and may it serve you instead of a better."

     "I am much beholden to you," replied the stranger; "much beholden to 
you,
and cannot thank you enough.  This change is most valuable.  I do not know 
in
what state I should have been, had you not come forward and offered the
shelter of your house to me.  I am very cold, indeed, and the warmth of yoru
fire is grateful to me."

     "I am glad of it, sir.  You are the only one, I fear, as far as I know,
that is saved.  Was there many on board?"

     "About twenty, I think."

     "Poor fellows! they have met with a watery grave."

     "Yes, they have, I fear.  They have had a fearful struggle, for many 
were
lashed to spars, hoping they might be washed, or floated, ashore.  I hope I 
am
not disturbing, though I fear I am, your wife and daughter-- that is your
daughter, I presume, if I may judge from her likeness to yourself."

     "Yes, sir, that is my daughter; she's a good girl, sir, though I say 
so,
that am her father; and if a secret must be told, in another month she will
exchange a father's for a husband's control and care, which will I hope, be 
a
happy change."

     "They have long loved each other," said the mother, "and, to my mind, 
it
is cruel to keep them apart.  Times will never be better, and I don't see 
but
they may begin the world as well as others, with little more than a will to
work."

     "You are right," said the stranger; "you are right; it was never 
intended
that mankind should wait till circumstances were propitious, or it would 
have
made the desire dependent upon circumstances, too."

     "You have hit the right nail, sir-- you have spoken the truth; but 
still
we must recommend caution."

     "Very right.  I wish them joy and prosperity," said the stranger.

     There was now a bustle in the cottage.  Some of those who had 
accompanied
the stranger into the hut, now departed, while the remainder left a few
moments after, in company, leaving the fisherman and his family with their
guest.

     "Well," said one, "of all the odd looking fish that ever I saw come out
of the sea, I think he beats all; not but what I make every allowance, but I
cannot make any in such a case, because he has not been drowned."

     "He was quite insensible, and had been so for a long time.  Don't you
remember what he said about his becoming insensible immediately after the 
ship
struck."

     "Yes; I heard it all, but hang me if I can understand it. He is as if 
he
had been bled to death, and then came to life."

     "He ain't got much of a colour."

     "No; but more than that, the dreadful deathly, or ashy paleness is
fearful; and then his peculiar features, his long hair, flattened to his 
head
by the water, and the teeth in his head, which appear as if they had been 
set
with the express intention of enabling him to catch otters."

     "That would be no easy task, either; but I must say, as you say, that
there have been better looking men than he, at all events."

          *             *             *             *             *

     In the fisherman's hut the stranger was willingly attended to by the
fisherman and his family, without any invidious attention; and when he had
changed his habiliments, he seated himself again by the fire, when some warm
drinks and other refreshment were given him.

     "I did not think to find any one alive when I went down to the beach,"
said the fisherman.  "I thought all were lost."

     "And I doubt not but they are all lost, save myself," said the 
stranger,
blandly; "and though I do not appear much hurt by the occurrence, yet I feel
as if the whole mass of my blood was changed, and that I should never again
be what I was; that, in fact, I shall always carry about me the appearance,
and certainly the feeling, of a man torn from the arms of death, and made to
live."

     "It does affect some people strangely," said the fisherman.  "I know 
what
shipwreck is myself, and, therefore, can easily guess what it is to those 
who
are unused to the sea.  I was the only one saved out of a whole crew."

     "Indeed! then your case is identical with mine."

     "In that respect it is," replied the fisherman; "but I was used to the
dangers of the sea; and, though that makes no difference when you find
yourself in the boiling waters, yet a man who has the fear of wreck 
constantly
before his eyes, can see the danger -- take more precaution, and is not so
likely to lose that presence of mind which at such times is so valuable."

     "So it is; though I took it very quietly, and stood still until I was
thrown down by the first shock of the vessel."

     "She struck more than once?"

     "She did; four or five times; she was thrown upon the rocks in shallow
water, I believe, as I understand these matters."

     "Yes, it was so," said the fiserhman -- "it was so."

     "Well, it was only when the waves left us that we came down with a
dreadful crashing shock, which caused the vessel to shiver as if she had 
been
but a leaf.  Well, every time a wave swept towards us, it lifted the vessel
off the rock, and carried her a few yards further, sometimes scraping and
scratching her keel as she went along; at other times, she was lifted clear 
of
the rocks, and then suddenly thrown upon them with great force, and then 
every
timber separated."

     "Just what might be expected."

     "And just as it occured," said the stranger.

     "And, of course, the crew were carried into the sea, and drowned."

     "Yes; but what became of them-- I mean where they were carried to-- I
cannot tell; but I suppose among the tall rocks that I saw before the wreck.
But why was I not carried there and left?"

     "It is something that neither you nor I can tell," said the fisherman.

     "Perhaps so; but I am safe, and only so to tell the disaster to others,
not for a warning; for it can be none, but I am saved."

     "You are.  Perhaps you would like to lie down for an hour or two before
daylight comes, and then we will take a walk down to the shore in the 
morning,
and see if there is anything washed ashore."

     "I am tired, and think that it would be of some service, if I can 
sleep;
though I dare say I shall be dreaming of what I have seen and felt, and 
hardly
dare to sleep, so great is the disturbance in my mind."

     "Sit up, and welcome, by the fire," said the fisherman; "you can do so;
it may be as well, perhaps, too-- you may be able to sleep that way."

     "No, no, I'll lie down on the boards-- I am not particular upon such an
occasion; and, as it has turned out, I shall be too much in need of rest to
sit up.  The warmth of the fire, too, draws me off, I can find, and I dare 
say
you feel it too."

     "It has that effect, as much as I am used to it," replied the 
fisherman;
"but do what you please; I shall turn in till daylight, unless you want
anything more."

     "Nothing, thank you, my good friend, but a place to lie down on, and 
then
I am quite content for the remainder of the night."

     "There is a settle up in yon corner where you can sleep; it is rough 
and
homely, but we have nothing otherwise here."

     "No apology; I am too thankful for what I have escaped from, and for 
what
I have received, to look hard at the mercies afforded me."

          *             *             *             *             *

     The stranger said no more, but took the fisherman's advice and walked 
to
the settle, and then lay down with his face towards the fire.

     "Good night," said the fisherman; "pleasant slumbers."

     "The same to you, my friend; I hope I have not dispossessed any of your
family of their means of rest.  I have, perhaps, deprived them of their 
bed."

     "No, no; sleep in peace; we are all provided for.  I sleep here," he
said, as he was about to open the door; "and my daughter sleeps there," he
added, pointing to a small door.  "So, you see, we have our appointed 
places,
and that on which you now sleep is retained for the use of any strange
traveller of friend that may need it."

     "Then good night," said the stranger, which was returned again by the
fisherman, who entered his own room, leaving his guest lying on his bed, and
looking around him by the light of the fire, which burned yet for some time.

THE NIGHT IN THE FISHERMAN'S HUT. -- THE MIDNIGHT FEAST OF BLOOD. -- THE
CHASE, AND THE GUN-SHOT.


     The stranger, as he lay, listened to the sounds that were emitted by, 
and
occasionally opened his eyes to gaze upon, the flames, as they ran upwards; 
he
watched the forked tongues as they played about the faggots, and then turned
his eyes towards the various parts of the apartment as it was now and then
illuminated with its warm glare.

     What might have been his feelings after his esacpe it is difficult to
conjecture, for he appeared not inclined to sleep, but to gaze about him and
keep watch over the fire, which every now and then blazed up afresh; and his
mind appeared to be intent upon something else than merely thinking of the
past -- there was too much of inquiry and curiosity about it.

     "The time has come round again," he muttered; "my blood requires 
renewal,
my strength renovation, and no aliment will do that but maiden's blood."

     A horrible expression of countenance came over him that must have 
caused
a feeling of horror to have crept through the veins of any one who might 
have
been near to see him; but, as it was, he was alone, and there was no one to 
be
terrified.

     "Yes, yes; I must have that supply, else though the sea may give up its
dead, and the earth refuse to cover me, yet I may sink into that sleep I 
would
so willingly escape from; then, indeed, I should suffer what I cannot bear 
to
think of.

     "Yet how near have I been to that death from which I have believed it
impossible to return; but yet the moonbeams have found me, and I have again
been re-animated, and the horrible appetite has returned which must have its
periodical meal-- its terrible and disgusting repast.  It must be done, aye,
it must be done."

     As he muttered, his lips met, and his long tongue was occasionally 
thrust
out, as if he were anticipating the pleasures of the feast.

     "Yes, yes; this very night must renew the life that has been this night
restored to me.  I must make a fresh attempt.  I think he said his daughter
lay in yonder chamber; in another hour I will adventure upon this scheme."

     His eyes were fixed upon the door, which he appeared to watch and 
examine
with the utmost care and avidity.

     He watched, however, for some time, and the flames appeared to subside,
and the embers gave out a dull, red glare, and some warmth.

     "Now is the moment," he muttered, as he rose softly from his bed; "now 
is
the moment-- all are asleep, and stillness reigns around me.  I will go and
ascertain if all be quiet, and then to my midnight orgies-- a feast that 
shall
restore me to my life-- my former self."

     He crawled out of the bed, and stood upright for a moment, and 
listened,
and then, with a noiseless step, he crept to the door of the fisherman's
bedroom, and then listened for some seconds, and muttered as if he were
satisfied, --

     "Yes, yes; they sleep sound enough, and will not readily awaken."

     He then took a small cord, and tied the handle of the door to a nail on
the post, so as to offer an impediment to egress from the sleeping-room, and
then he went towards the other which the fisherman had told him belonged to
his daughter.  He paused, and listened at the door for a few momemnts, and
then he said, --

     "Yes, yes; that is the maiden's chamber-- that is sure to be her
chamber-- her father said so, and I have no reason to doubt he told the 
truth,
since he had no cause to lie; here, then, is the casket that contains all my
treasure-- the elixir vitae of my life-- the undefiled blood of a maiden's
veins."

     He tried the door, but it was secured on the inside.

     This, for a moment, disconcerted him, and he took a moment or two to
consider what best could be done; and at length he saw a small chink in the
wall, which he approached; then, peeping in, he saw that if he could enlarge
the hole, he might push his hand in, and open the door by undoing the
fastenings.

     This was effected by means of a chisel which happened to be lying near 
at
hand; then he opened it, and thrust in his hand and withdrew the bolt that
held the door, and quietly opened it.

     With cat-like caution he approached the bed where the fisherman's
daughter lay.  She was a beautiful girl, scarce eighteen, and, by a consent 
of
all, the queen of the place, in respect of beauty.

     With greedy eyes the vampyre approached the bed on which lay the form 
of
the sleeping maiden, and gazed upon her fair white neck and bosom -- heaving
with the sleeper's breath; and then, as if he could contain himself no 
longer,
he eagerly bent down over her, and then, as her face was turned on one side,
his lips and teeth approached the side exposed.

          *             *             *             *             *

     A scream ran through the fisherman's hut that awoke its inmates in an
instant, and which, though it banished sleep, yet it gave not the power of
thought.

     "Help! help! help!" screamed the maiden.

     "'Tis Mary!" said the fisherman; "surely----"

     "Hasten, and see what 'tis that ails her.  She never would scream so,
unless in utmost peril; hasten, and see."

     "Help! help! again screamed the maiden, as she struggled in the arms of
the monster, who kept her in his powerful grasp while he sought the life
current that crimsoned her veins with horrible desire.

     "The door is secured; d---n!" muttered the fisherman.  "What does this
mean?  Give me my gun down, while I force the door."

     The old woman handed down the gun, while the fisherman put his strength
to the door, which quickly gave way and flew open.

     "Here is your gun.  Be quick; but do not be too hasty in its use.  See 
to
Mary and the shipwrecked voyager."

     "Who secured my door, dame, but he?"

     "The door!  Ay, I remember-- hasten!"

     "Help-- help!" again shouted or screamed Mary, but not in so loud a 
voice
as before; she was getting weaker, and just as the fisherman emerged into 
the
large room, the faggots fell together and gave forth a sudden blaze, and in 
an
instant the whole place was lighted up, and the fisherman's eye sought the
couch of the stranger whom he had lodged, but the bed was empty.

     "Gone!" he muttered -- "gone!"

     He turned his head in the direction of his daughter's bedchamber, and 
saw
the door was open, and he heard a struggle and a sucking noise.

     "Ha!" he muttered, and rushed in exclaiming -- "What means this noise?
Who calls for help?"

     The appearance of the fisherman was so opportune and so sudden, and so
intent was the vampyre upon the hideous meal, that he did not hear the
approach of the fisherman, and it was not until the latter shouted that he
turned and saw him.

     "Treacherous and ungrateful villain!" said the fisherman, who was 
almost
powerless from terror and astonishment.

     The vampyre turned and dropped his victim on the bed, while he
endeavoured to pass the fisherman; but the act recalled him to himself, and 
he
made a blow at him with the but-end of the gun; but the vampyre jumped back,
and the blow missed its intended object, and they both closed for a 
struggle.

     The fisherman, however, found that he had one to do with whose strength
was even greater than his own, however great that might be; and in a moment
more he was thrown down, and the monster rushed across the outer room,
oversetting the fisherman's wife; and forcing open the outer door, he fled.

     "I am thrown," said the fisherman, rising; "but not done for.  Mary, 
are
you hurt?"

     "Oh, my God-- my God!" exclaimed the poor girl.  "He had begun to eat 
me
and suck my blood!  I have the marks of his teeth in me."

     "I'll have revenge upon him yet."

     "Nay, father.  He is some monster-- do not go!"

     "No, no," said his wife -- "no, husband, do not attempt it!  [          
]
strong he is; he may do you a mischief."

     "I know," said the fisherman.  "He has thrown me, and he has abused my
hospitality; he is not fit to live.  He has not, however, any means of
fighting against the contents of my gun.  I have got that loaded, and will
punish him.  Be he man or devil, I will make the experiment of following 
him."

     All this took place in less time than it takes to relate it, and the
fisherman rushed out of his hut to follow the stranger who had acted so 
badly.

     It was now early dawn; and, though the waves still lashed the shore in
angry violence, and kept up a ceaseless roar, yet the sky betrayed none of 
the
the signs of yesterday's storm, but was serene and calm, and not a cloud was
to be seen -- nothing but a dim, grey night pervaded all space.

     There was just light enough to see objects moving about, and when the
fisherman got outside the hut, he saw, about a hundred yards or better 
before
him, the form of the stranger, making for the woodland at the height of his
speed.

     The fisherman hastened to intercept him which, however, was 
unnecessary,
for another, coming from that quarter, turned him, and he fled towards the
sea, whither he was followed, and, when upon the cliffs, the fisherman 
fired,
and the vampyre fell over and was supposed to have been drowned.

 Next Time: The Assassins on the Rialto. -- The Attack and Defeat. -- The
 Stranger.




                             CHAPTER CLXI. [sic]

                               [Chapter 169]

THE ASSASSINS ON THE RIALTO. -- THE ATTACK AND DEFEAT. -- THE STRANGER.


     On the Rialto, one evening, as the sun was sinking in the golden west, 
a
stranger was seen walking to and fro in deep musing, apparently unmindful of
what was passing around him, or of the approach of evening, an hour when the
remorseless assassin is known to stalk abroad in the streets of Venice, and
there the dagger finds is victim.

     Several individuals looked hard at the stranger in the cloak, but no 
one
approached him, save those who passed him, and in doing so bestowed a 
passing
gaze upon him, which was not returned, for he heeded no one.  But he was not
much open to recognition even if he were known, for the cloak with which he
had enveloped himself was of such ample dimensions that it completely
concealed him from the curiosity of the many; indeed, his face was hardly
visible, for the fur collar he wore hid all save the bridge of a prominent
nose, and his eyes, which had a peculiar lustre.

     The evening still grew darker and later, and the passengers were fewer
and fewer, but still the tall stranger walked slowly up and down; but no one
ventured to say anything, though more than one had the inclination to speak;
but the tallness of the man, and the point of the long rapier which appeared
beneath the cloak, checked any inclination to familiarity, and induced a 
more
voluntary courtesy than might at all times have been accorded.

     There were, indeed, a small knot of three individuals, who kept near 
the
same place, and whose eyes every now and then directed their glances towards
the stranger, as if they regarded him with impatience.

     These men were of a suspicious character; they all wore cloaks and
slouched hats, but they had all seen some service, and were somewhat the 
worse
for it.  They conversed together, and walked away for a short space, but 
they
returned presently, and still found the stranger as before at the same spot.

     "Well," said one of the three, as they again met at a certain spot, 
"what
think you now-- is he a spy or not?"

     "I don't know what to think, Rubino.  Spy or no spy, he will interfere
with our duty to-night.  I wonder what is best."

     "What do you mean?"

     "Why, would it be better to chance his presence, or shall we put him
away?  He evidently intends remaining there, the devil only knows how long."

     "I believe you; but it appears to me that both plans are objectionable 
to
the last degree, though I confess I can see no alternative whatever."

     "Which do you consider the least objectionable plan? -- that is what we
have to consider, for there are but two plans, and we cannot fail to do our
business; should we do so, we should lose something, and we should never get
any more employment."

     "Good.  If we attack him, we shall lose our chance with our better
customer.  We shall lose our man, at the least, if we get clear."

     "He wears a long sword, and is a tall man.  If he has any skill, and I
dare be sworn he has, he will prove an ugly customer."

     "We are three."

     "That is very true; but an encounter only makes it the worse, and even 
if
he be killed, which, if we are true to ourselves, he must be, we shall be
obliged to quit the spot, and our main object defeated."

     "That is most true; but shall we risk the attempt when there are two?  
It
will make it too many odds; we shall not be so sure of success as we ought 
to
be."

     "We have the advantage of striking when we are not seen.  A blow is 
sure
when no hand is raised to ward it off."

     "Ay, we should dispose of one before he has made any resistance, and
before the other can offer any opposition or attempt any assistance, should
the first have life enough to call out.  Come, come, let's have no fear of 
the
result; it is all in our own hands."

     "Shall we not run more danger during the encounter of being taken by
others who may come up, attracted by the fray?  There is much to be said 
about
making an alarm, because numbers will then be drawn upon us, and you know we
have little sympathy among the multitude."

     "No, no; we must make all possible haste, and then we may elude all
possible chance.  Strike the blow home, and then we may baffle all; for if 
he
cry, he will fall, and those who help him, will raise him, and we shall have
time to make our escape."

     "No doubt-- no doubt; 'tis a good plan-- a very good plan, and one that 
I
think will succeed; at all events, it only wants a good trial to make it
succeed; you see, a strong arm, quick eye, and swift foot, is all that are
necessary."

     "I see; and one more quality."

     "What is it?"

     "Good luck."

     "Granted; but that often comes from the manner in which a thing is 
done,
and sometimes from the want of skill in those who should make it the 
reverse.
Confusion for a moment gives us our luck, and then we are safe."

     "So we are."

     "How goes the time, Rubino?" inquired one of the assassins, for such 
they
were.

     "Oh, it yet wants one hour of the time in which we are to meet him."

     "Well, then, we have more than a chance yet of our being undisturbed
here, and the stranger may leave for some other part of the city; but our 
plan
is fixed whether or no.  Shall we turn into a vintner's?"

     "No; we have no time for that, as yet."

     "No time!  What mean you Rubino?"

     "That we have no time," replied Rubino, "to quit this neighbourhood,
because you will perceive he may come any time these next two hours, which 
is
a matter of some importance; for if he reach home alive, we have miscarried,
and incur great displeasure, if not vengeance."

     "We care but little for the vengeance of another."

     "We may not individually; but you must know, this one knows too much of
us and our haunts to be a safe and pleasant enemy; besides, we shall lose a
liberal patron-- one who has given us some gold and promised us more."

     "Ay, ay; he's the man to serve, and we will not disoblige him; we'll 
deal
fairly by him, and he cannot expect more."

     "And he will reward us liberally."

     "Amen, say I.  Now we have waited long enough, let us walk down the
Rialto, and when we get to the other end, we can plant ourselves in such a
position to watch his advance towards us, and then we can walk to him."

     "Had we better not remain somewhere nearer at hand, because we can then
start on him unawares, and thus have a blow without alarming him; and, if 
that
be a deadly one, why, then we are safe.  No one will know the mischief is
done."

     "So much the better; but come, we will continue our walk; it will lull
suspicion, and when we come again, one of our number can creep into one of
these alcoves, and there wait against his coming."

     "And you will be at hand?"

     "Of course; we shall keep upon the look out, so as to be near at the
moment you commence the attack."

     "But suppose I should fall?"

     "Then you must continue the attack in a sharp and rapid manner, 
engaging
all his attention to defend himself."

     "Ay; and leave me to myself to the attack of that man yonder, should he
be at hand at that moment."

     "Oh, no, no.  Do not hurt yourself.  You need be under no fear of that
sort, for you see it will only be man to man, and a fair encounter."

     "It has never yet been fairly done, and will not be with me in this
matter, don't you see.  If help arrives, I'm lost; and, if I be lost without
help, it will be the worse for you.  I'll take my share of danger and 
mishap,
but I won't be imposed upon by a comrade, and so you will understand it
first."

     "Who was desirous you should?  Shall we not be at hand?"

     "At your heels, I expect; but don't you see that, by giving a minute's
time, you endanger all; for, if my first attack fail, he ought not to be
allowed rallying time; he ought not to be permitted to recover himself, and
attempt defence, indeed, because that gives time, and we may be beat by 
others
coming from whatever quarter we may go."

     "We do not intend it.  We only are desirous that one of us should be
prepared to make the attack, while we are walking to and fro, and perhaps
attracting his attention, and drawing it from you.  Then we aid you; but,
should you be foiled, why we will hasten as if we were coming to help him."

     "I see; well, let it be so."

     "Good.  We can then act effectively, and we are the gainers by this
stratagem.  Now then, Roberto, do thou hide thyself in yonder alcove."

     "I will.  My dagger is sharp, and you know my arm is not usually a weak
one, and that I have done some service with it ere now."

     "Thou hast."

     "And it will again do more."

     "Hush! hasten in.  I hear footsteps yonder.  'Tis he, I think.  We will
not go far, but within the reach of your eye; fifty yards, at most, will be
the distance.  We will take and come towards you the moment we find he has
reached you."

     "Good.  Begone-- he comes."

     The assassin stole into an alcove, and then paused in the deep shade of
the place where he had concealed himself, and the other two walked down a
short distance -- about a hundred and fifty yards or so -- and then paused 
and
looked back.

     "Do you see anything of them?"

     "No; I don't at this moment.  It is getting very dark."

     "We had better return and see what happens.  We shall get up in the 
very
nick of time, and be able to take part in the fray."

     "Well, be it so," replied the other.  "I'll go with you; but we run 
some
risk in encountering the stranger in the rapier and long cloak."

     "Most true; but we shall not have taken any part in the affair; that 
will
clear us of anything that may tend to inculpate us.  We are right; and, if 
we
find our comrade hardly pressed, we can aid him, and that at a time when it 
is
unexpected by the other party.  Hark! they are at it already."

     "Come on."

     They both hastened towards the scene of combat, towards which they both
ran, for they knew their comrade's voice.

     The other villain awaited the coming of the stranger, whom he was 
waiting
to assassinate, as soon as hi comrades had left him.

     The unconscious stranger walked down the Rialto with a slow and steady
gait, humming an air from some opera as he walked along, well pleased in his
own mind.  He wore his cloak open in front, and his sword dangling at his
side, and altogether most unsuspicious of an attack.

     Scarcely, however, had he passed the assassin's hiding-place, than the
fellow rushed out and made a desperate blow at him with his dagger, which,
however, miscarried, on account of the loose manner in which he wore his
cloak; the blow was foiled by the folds of the garment, and the wearer 
turned
round.

     "Villain!" he exclaimed, "thou shalt have thy deserts;" and, as he 
spoke,
he drew his sword, and became the assailant in his turn.

     "Help! help!" shouted the villain, who found himself beset by one who
would quickly make him repent his temerity.

     At that moment the rest of the assassins came up, and commenced a 
furious
attack upon the single stranger, who, of course, from being almost a victor,
was immediately compelled to give ground to the three.

     "Help! help!" shouted the stranger, as he was forced on one knee, and
that with a wound; but at that moment help was at hand, and the tall 
stranger
stepped up to his side, and casting his cloak on one side, and drawing his
rapier, he ran one of the assailants through the body and he fell backwards
dead.

     A furious combat ensued between the stranger and the other two 
assassins,
who were compelled to fight, so closely were they pressed by the stranger;
however, after a few moments, they turned and fled.

     The stranger then turned towards the wounded man, who was rising from 
the
ground by the help of the pillar that was supporting the sides of the 
alcove,
and then endeavoured to stanch the wound he had received.

 Next Time: Count Pollidori's Palace. -- Signora Isabella, the Count's
 Daughter. -- The Introduction.




                             CHAPTER CLXII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 170]

COUNT POLLIDORI'S PALACE. -- SIGNORA ISABELLA, THE COUNT'S DAUGHTER. -- THE
INTRODUCTION.


     The stranger walked up to him and offered his services, saying, --

     "Are you hurt, signor? -- you bleed!"

     "But slightly hurt, signor, thank you for that; you have saved my life.
I had been cold meat, indeed-- a bloody corpse for all Venice to look upon
to-morrow, but for your valour and stout assistance."

     "Name it not, signor; but the rascals have been well paid.  There lies
one of them-- the others have escaped; but permit me, signor, to say, that 
the
sooner you get away from this spot the better, for the knaves may return in
greater force than before, or they will wait till you leave; by that time 
they
will have rallied, and dart out upon you as you pass along."

     "I do not fear that, signor, much; but the fact is, I am almost too 
weak
to walk unaided."

     "Permit me to render you the assistance you require.  I am a stranger 
in
this place, and therefore unused to your ways; but---"

     "Say no more, signor; I will accept of your services if you will accept
of a lodging at my poor home.  I have that which shall make you welcome--
heartily welcome; and the signora, my daughter, shall make you welcome, 
too."

     "Signor, if I can be of service to you I will do so with pleasure.  
Lend
me your arm, signor; but your wound is not stanched-- let me bind it more
carefully and securely; you ought not to bleed from such a wound when
bandaged."

     "Perhaps, signor, you have had more to do with these matters than I.  I
am a peaceable Venetian of rank, and neither afraid nor unwilling to draw a
sword in a good quarrel, shrinking not from some odds, but I have had no
practice in these matters; times and circmustances have not been 
propitious."

     "It matters not," replied the stranger; "you shewed what you were when
you had nearly defeated one, and afterwards kept at bay three.  He must be a
man who can behave thus, sir; he must have the heart and conduct of a
soldier-- you would be one did occasion serve-- no man can be more; but I
have seen many climes, and have therefore some knowledge in these matters
beyond the mere inward power and courage.  I have, from sheer necessity, 
been
compelled to mix in _melees_, and not from inclination."

     "I thank you for your skill as a surgeon, for truly you have stopped 
the
bleeding, which I had not been able to do myself."

     "Lean on my shoulder, signor; it will enable you to walk better.  Have
you far to go?" inquired the stranger.

     "No, signor; but we will take a gondola, it will be the easier
travelling, and, moreover, it will land us at my house, where you shall be
most heartily welcome.  If we turn down here, we shall soon obtain the aid 
of
a gondolier.  I had intended walking, but I have enough of that for one 
night,
even if I were able to walk, which I am not."

     "As you please, signor."

     As the stranger spoke he walked towards the place indicated by the
wounded man, and in a few moments more they reached the grand canal, and
finding a gondolier sleeping in his gondola, the stranger left his wounded
companion to wake the sleeper to his duty, by shaking him.

     "Hillo!" said the stranger, "will nothing wake you-- get up instantly,
and about your duty.  Do you always sleep here?"

     "No, signor," said the man, sleepily.

     "Well, then, are you engaged?"

     "Yes, signor, if you engage me."

     "Well, then, I do."

     "Where to, signor?"

     "Come with me to bring a wounded gentleman into the gondola, and he 
will
tell you where to.  Come, quick-- have you not yet awakened?"

     "I'm awake, signor, and willing," said the gondolier, following the
stranger to the spot where the wounded man was standing, and, by direction 
of
the stranger, he aided the wounded signor into the gondola.

     "Now, signors, I have but to know where you desire to go to."

     "Row on until I tell you where to stop.  Follow the course of the grand
canal, and you will go right enough."

     There was some time spent in silence, while the gondolier rowed as
desired up the grand canal, until they came to a large mansion, which the
wounded man gazed upon, and, after a moment's pause, as if he had a 
difficulty
in speaking, he said, as he pointed to the building, --

     "There, row up to yonder steps; there I will land-- that is my house."

     The gondolier immediately obeyed the injunction, and pulled for the
stairs, and when they reached the place, the gondolier stepped out and 
secured
the gondola.

     "Call out some of my people," said the wounded man, "call them out.  I 
am
very stiff, and not able to get out."

     The gondolier obeyed, and in a few minutes more several men, all in
livery, ran down the steps to the gondola, and lifted their master out, who
appeared to be unable to do so of himself.

     The gondolier was rewarded according to his deserts, and the stranger
followed the wounded man into his own house, which was a most extensive
building, and filled with servants, and furnished in the richest manner,
displaying magnificence and wealth to a degree that was scarce to be 
surpassed
in Venice.

     They were shown into an apartment replete with every appointment that
wealth or luxury could suggest, and the wounded ma was placed on a sofa, and
his attendants stood round him as if waiting his orders.

     "Signor and stranger," he said, "welcome to my house, as the preserver 
of
my life.  All I have here is at your service.["]

     "I am obliged," replied the stranger, with a dignified acknowledgement 
of
the courtesy-- "I am obliged; but I cannot recognise on my part any such
right.  If I have done you service-- as I will not affect to believe I have
not-- still you overrate the amount of it.  But I will accept of your
hospitality for this night; for I am a stranger in Venice, and have little 
or
no knowledge of the best course to pursue."

     "Remain here."

     "But you had better dispatch some one for aid," interrupted the 
stranger.
"You are in pain, at this very instant; send for some assistance.  You 
require
the aid of a leech immediately."

     "I am faint-- very faint," he replied.

     "Hasten," said the stranger -- "hasten some of you to fetch a leech,
instead of losing your wits in silent astonishment."

     The servants immediately bustled about, and seemed to have awakened 
from
a trance, and were seen running in different directions.  The room was soon
cleared, and the tall stranger seated himself by his wounded host.

     "In me you see the Count Polidori." [sic]

     The stranger bowed.

     "I am not a native of this city, though now one of her favoured 
citizens.
I have left the land of my birth because I and my rulers could not agree, 
and
I ran some danger in staying against their will, and I have settled and
married here."

     "Our adopted country is that which demands our care and preference,"
replied the stranger.  "That, at least, is my opinion."

     "No doubt.  I am now," he continued, "a widower."

     "Your lady is dead?"

     "Yes; I am sorry to say so.  I have, however, one child living at home,
and one who is serving his country in her fleets, an honour to our house; 
but
my greatest comfort is the dear image of my lost wife-- my daughter."

     "Is she here now?"

     "Yes; in this palace.  Signora Isabella is devoted to her father, and
would not for the world do aught that would give me a moment's pain; indeed,
she would die for me rather than I should feel displeasure."

     "Such a daughter must be a treasure."

     "She is a treasure."

     "And what an inestimable jewel would she be as a wife."

     "She will be when the day comes when she will mate, which I hope will 
be
before I die; for I should be too anxious respecting the worth of the man 
who
was to be her husband, to permit me to die happy, unless I saw and approved 
of
the choice, or chose the individual myself."

     "I see you are more anxious," said the stranger, mildly, "in providing
future happiness for your daughter, rather than in hoarding wealth or titles
for her."

     "I am," said the count.

     "And a most laudable ambition, too; an ambition that few parents do not
neglect in the pursuit of one of a different character-- either some young
love, or some one who is endowed largely with worldly goods or titles."

     "My Isabella will have enough of both; and, therefore, she will not 
need
to seek for them; but she will not throw herself away upon any nameless
adventurer who may love her fortune better than herself."

     "That would be as cruel a neglect as the other," replied the stranger;
"and, in my opinion, more culpable of the two."

     "So it would."

     At that moment the door opened hastily, and a light step was heard, and
before the stranger could turn round, a lovely young female rushed to the 
side
of the count, throwing herself on her knees, saying, --

     "Oh, heavens! my dear father, what has happened?  Are you hurt?  For
Heaven's sake, my dear father, what is the matter?"

     "Little or nothing, my dear Isabella."

     "But you are wounded.  Ah! there is blood!  My God! my God!"

     "Hush, Isabella.  I am wounded, but not hurt seriously."

     "I pray Heaven it may be so.  But what sacrilegious hand could be 
raised
against you?  You have wronged no one."

     "I am not aware of having done so, certainly," said the count; "but 
that
does not always give any security to the wealthy.  They will sometimes 
destroy
them from motives apart from individual revenge."

     "The monsters!  But have the villains been secured?"

     "One has paid the forfeit of his life for his temerity and villany; the
rest fled."

     "Ah! what will these assassins not risk?"

     "Well, my dear Isabella, I have answered your inquiries, and now,
perhaps, you will see if you be alone with me."

     "Alone with you!" repeated Isabella, not quite comprehending the words;
but she looked up, and her eyes encountered those of the stranger, who was
gazing earnestly upon her, and she started, as she rose ans said, --

     "Excuse me, signor, excuse me-- I knew not any one was present."

     "Nay," said the stranger, "filial love and respect need no excuse,
signora.  Do not think so badly of me as to imagine I can think otherwise 
than
you were actuated by the tenderest impulses."

     "Your kindness, sir----"

     "Isabella," said the count, interrupting her, "but for this gentleman's
timely and efficient aid, I should at this moment have been a corpse in the
streets of Venice."

     "You, my father?"

     "Yes, my child.  This signor came up just as I was wounded and beaten
down, and saved me from death.  He killed one of my assailants, while he put
to flight the other two, who left their dead companion in the streets.  
Thank
him, my child, for he is my preserver, and he deserves thanks for the deed 
as
well as for the bravery with which it was done, for he ran great risks in 
such
odds."

     "He must.  Signor, I know not how to thank you or what to say; the
greatness of the obligation paralyzes me, and I have not words to tell you 
how
grateful I feel for your goodness and courage; but 'tis an obligation that 
can
never be forgotten or ever repaid-- it is impossible."

     "My dear signora, permit me to say you rate my services too highly."

     "Nay, that is quite impossible; for my father's life I prize far before
my own-- before anybody in the world; and to save that is to lay me under 
the
heaviest obligation it is possible to impose upon me."

     "Say no more, signora; I will not underrate it after what you have 
said;
but you must say as little about it as you will.  I am happy, however, to 
have
done any act worthy of your thanks."

 Next Time: The Opinions of Doctor Pilletto. -- The Stranger's Account of
 Himself. -- The Welcome of the Signora.




                            CHAPTER CLXIII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 171]

THE OPINIONS OF DOCTOR PILLETTO. -- THE STRANGER'S ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF. -- 
THE
WELCOME OF THE SIGNORA.


     At that moment the door opened, and a servant announced the arrival of 
a
leech, the famous Doctor Pilletto, who forthwith entered the apartment, and
advanced towards the couch on which the wounded man lay.

     "Oh, doctor, do what you can for my father," said Signora Isabella.

     "I will, signora," replied the doctor.  "I will; but what are this 
hurts
or his disease? for I see he has been taken very badly; but why this 
paleness?
You appear to have lost blood."

     "I have bled, doctor, and I want you to dress my wound.  I am hurt in 
the
side here, and but for my friend here I should have been hurt mortally."

     "It was not a duel then?" said the doctor.

     "No, no, doctor, no, no; it was an attempt at assassination, and I have
escaped the death some one with more enmity than courage had doomed me to;
but, at the same tiem, I am free, and one of his agents has perished."

     "'Tis but just," said the doctor; "but I must now see the wound; with
your good leave, we'll strip the wounded part and apply bandages to it, so 
as
to secure it; after which something else must be done."

     The wounded Pollidori was stripped, and, after some exertion, the wound
was dressed, and all bleeding stopped.

     "What is your candid opinion concerning my wound, doctor?" inquired the
count, "What do you think will be the result?  I would be truly informed of
whatever probability of danger there may be remote or immediate, as the case
may be; tell me, I beseech you, doctor?"

     "I will, count."

     "I have those things to do which are important, and the execution of 
them
depends upon your answer; so do not mislead me."

     "I will not; I cannot form so clear a judgment of your case as I can in 
a
few days hence, when I may see the progress of the wound towards healing;
though at present I see no signs of danger, yet some may come."

     "You do not consider the wound dangerous of itself?" said the stranger.

     "No, not of itself; but it is so close to a mortal part that it cannot 
be
considered free from danger; indeed, it may become so.  A little more on one
side would have made it quickly fatal; but, as it is, if it heal well, there
will be no danger.  You must keep your couch for some days."

     "That will be a lighter evil than any other," replied the count.

     "You have lost much blood, and that alone will make you very weak, and 
it
will take some time before you will be entirely recovered from your present
state, and then your wound will probably be healed."

     "And what you appear to think may be dangerous, is only any possible
interruption from the wound itself."

     "It does so happen sometimes from bodily infirmity, it shews itself in
healing, and the wound, which now appears healthy, may turn to gangrene, and
then the worst may be apprehended."

     "It may," said the stranger; "but these things are only the worst that
may happen in extreme cases."

     "Exactly," said the leech.

     "And you have seen nothing in this case to induce you to anticipate any
such result as this-- it is only what may happen."

     "That is all.  It appears to me that all is well at present."

     "Then I think the count had better be left to himself in quiet, and he
may have a good mind upon his recovery."

     "It will be best," said the doctor.

     "I am fatigued and sleepy," said the count; "I would be alone.  
Daughter,
you must entertain this gentleman as I would do were I able to do so.  
Signor,
the signora will do the office of hostess-- excuse so cold a welcome."

     "Name it not," said the stranger.  "I am well cared for.  A welcome 
from
such a one is well worth the acceptance of a prince, much less that of a
stranger unknown in Venice.  I thank you for it."

     "Say no more on that head," said the count.  "I came here almost a
refugee, and quite a stranger myself."

     "Will you come this way, signor," said Signora Isabella; "we will leave
my poor father to himself, he will sleep."

     The stranger rose, and Doctor Pilletto also, both following the 
signora,
who led them into a separate, but splendid apartment, and entreated them to
sit down, and apologised for her own want of spirits to entertain them
suitably.

     "For that matter," said the doctor, "I am by no means surprised; for 
such
a mishap can never be heard of without producing lowness of spirits."

     "And such a misfortune is always productive of grief," said the 
stranger.
"Signora, say no more, I would not interfere with your grief.  I do not wish
to stop it, and shall feel myself a bar to your own feelings if you say any
more.  I am made welcome, and feel myself so."

     "You are, sir-- your kindness deserves no less; but I pray you tell me
how this affair occurred, in which you have been of such signal service to 
my
father, in saving his life?"

     "To tell you that, signora, I must first tell you who and what I am."

     "I do not wish to be thought unduly curious," replied signora.

     "Not at all.  I am bound to acknowledge you have a right to it, for you
have no introduction with me which usually supplies the place of an account 
of
who and what we are; therefore I'll tell you, though I cannot boast of being
more than a simple chevalier of now no fortune, having left my country 
because
I raised my voice against the abuses of state; therefore I am but a nameless
and fortuneless stranger."

     "Many a worthy gentleman has been in such a plight before now," 
observed
the doctor.  "I have known many such."

     "And I am one.  Not that I am without means," added the stranger; "I 
have
been lucky enough to provide against such a calamity as that which has
befallen me, though not to the extent I could have wished."

     "You are fortunate, chevalier."

     "I am so far.  I came but this morning to Venice; I landed here, and
agreed to meet the captain of the vessel, who promised to meet me on the
Rialto, to conduct me to some quiet and respectable changehouse where I 
could
lodge."

     "And he met you not?"

     "No.  While I was waiting for him, I heard a cry for help, and found,
upon running up, the Count Pollidori beaten to the earth, beset by three
villains, who had already wounded him in the manner you have seen; and I at
that time stepped up, and, being unexpected, the men were confused, and one 
of
them fell, mortally wounded; and, after a little further desperate fighting,
they all fled."

     "It was fortunate you yourself were not beaten down too with such odds;
for these men are usually desperate."

     "True; but, you see, one was gone, and they could not tell how it might
be with the count-- they did not know how far he might be able to join in 
the
fray again, and if he were to do so, there would immediately be an equality
between us, and such men do not seek such a fight."

     "Truly not, chevalier," replied the signora -- "truly not.  When they 
are
safe and secure in their deeds of blood, they will perpetrate them; but in
fair contest such men never shine-- their deeds are of darkness."

     "Most true-- most true."

     "But they have a deal of ferocity," said the stranger; "and, when they
can, will pour out blood like water; but what amazes me is, that one like 
the
count, your father, should have been beset by such villains.  They must have
had some object to accomplish in getting rid of him by such means."

     "Private enmity."

     "Indeed!  It must be a bad state of things."

     "It is, chevalier.  It is a sign of great degeneracy in the state; but 
it
is so.  For gold you can procure the death of any man in Venice."

     "Horrible!" said the stranger.  "I have heard of such things; but I
deemed them fabulous, or, at least, overrated."

     "No, no-- I fear not; and yet, who could have an enmity so deep as only
to be healed by blood? and yet, the good and great have as many enemies as 
the
wicked, for they are always opposed to each other."

     "Undoubtedly," said the doctor; "good and bad are always antagonists."

     "Exactly.  What, however, is the worst in these cases is, the bad very
often get the better of the good, which is the reverse of what ought to be
done; because, you see, if we are to suppose that there is a power above 
that
rules men's actions, surely we might expect to see goodness manifest in the
majority of cases; whereas, we usually see, to a much greater extent, the
success of evil."

     "Not always."

     "Not always, certainly," said the doctor; "but the exception proves the
rule.  Goodness ought to be the great object of men's lives; but it is not;
yet it ought to rule, and we must endeavour to be ruled by it, despite the 
way
of the world, which is often, as we daily see, the reverse of what it ought 
to
be."

     "But," added the chevalier, "when ambition rules the minds of men, you
will find that all other principles give way."

     "It is so; but why, I cannot see."

     "Because 'tis the master emotion of the mind," said the stranger.

     "And ambition appears to possess the souls of those who govern, whether
for good or for evil," said the signora.  "Some are ambitions of being
rulers-- some of being conquers, and some of politicians; but they are all
moved to it by ambition."

     "Aye," said the stranger, "the lover is ambitious of the smiles of his
mistress, though ill fortune will, now and then, deny him the good luck to 
win
them."

 Next Time: The Count Pollidori's Recovery. -- The Interview With the 
Signora
 Isabella. -- The Consent.

                               [Chapter 172]

THE COUNT POLLIDORI'S RECOVERY. -- THE INTERVIEW WITH THE SIGNORA ISABELLA.
-- THE CONSENT.


     A few days' confinement placed the count beyond the reach of danger.  
His
wound healed rapidly and favourably, but which was more than anticipated by
the cautious leech, who abstained from saying so, but took his daily seat
beside his patient's bed, and, with his prosy and imperturbable gravity, he
continued to give his advice.

     "Count," he said, " your wound is healing."

     "I feel it is so," said the count.

     "But you must be cautious.  I would not have you be too sanguine, or
trust your feelings too much."

     "I do not; but I may take wine?"

     "Indeed, I would recommend you not to do so; for wine is inflammatory,
and you are likely to suffer for it."

     "And yet I took a bottle last evening."

     "Last evening, count?" said the physician.

     "Yes; I speak truly."

     "I doubt it not; but it was very imprudent-- very imprudent, indeed; 
for,
though half a bottle may do no hurt to a man in full health, yet a whole can
do him no good, even if it do him no harm; but, in your case, it is
dangerous."

     "It might be; but surely the danger is past now?"

     "If you have taken it over twelve hours-- though four-and-twenty would 
be
better."

     "It is over twelve hours."

     "'Tis well; but it was hazardous; you are fast getting well, and, as it
happens, you have no fever, or other evil changes about you; therefore, you
may continue your wine, but not in such quantities."

     "I will be more cautious; but, Pilletto, what is your opinion of my
guest?"

     "Your preserver?"

     "Yes; the same."

     "He is one of the most learned men I ever met with; even professed
scholars have not been found so full of knowledge."

     "That speaks something for his youth."

     "Most undoubtedly."

     "But what think you of him as a man of the world?"

     "I think he has a vast fund of information; he has had an enlarged
experience of society, and has visited, I think, all the continent of 
Europe;
he understands their languages and manners, too, and has the appearance of a
traveller, and a man used to the best and most distinguished society."

     "That is just my opinion of him."

     "I understand he is from France."

     "Yes."

     "A refugee, in point of fact, I suppose, without means."

     "No, he appears to have means, and hopes that times my so alter to 
permit
his return, and the resumption of his former fortune."

     "I understand as much, and he has spoken of people whom I know well in
France, that would not associate with any beneath their degree; and he has
told me things they would have divulged to none, save their equals and
families."

     "It is my opinion of him."
     
           *             *             *             *             *

     The doctor took his leave, and the count was again left to himself, and
he began evidently to ponder over something in his mind, which appeared to
demand his attention, and he, for some time, sat immoveable.

     "My daughter," he murmured, "is a rich reward even for such a deed.  I 
do
not pit my life against her's; no, no; she is by far the most valuable; she 
I
love more than life, and would provide for her in a manner that shall 
procure
her future happiness, rather than her immediate approval.

     "The dear girl does not well understand these matters; she does not 
know
that present pleasure may be followed by future pain.  She knows not that we
should forgo the present, to ensure future happiness."

     He paused a moment, and then he continued, --

     "But I cannot be mistaken in this man.  No, he has done a deed, which,
though I value it not at so high a price, yet gratitude impose upon me the
necessity of showing the highest consideration.  She is fancy free; and I do
not see there will be any difficulty in the way whatever."

     At tha moment the door opened, and Signora Isabella entered, and 
advanced
towards the couch on which he lay.

     "My father!"

     "Ah, Isabella, I was but then thinking of you."

     "Of me, father?  I come to see how you are.  Our good guest and 
preserver
had been telling me he is quite sure you are much better than Doctor 
Pilletto
will admit; for he is slow and cautious to a degree."

     "My dear, he is quite right-- I feel it."

     "Oh, how joyful I am!"

     "What think you of our guest, Isabella?  Do you not think him a man 
well
worthy of our warmest esteem and gratitude?"

     "Indeed he is, father-- he is noble."

     "I think so-- the true nobility of soul can be seen in him; to such a 
man
as the chevalier, would I see my Isabella united; to such a man could I
confide my daughter's happiness, for he would secure it."

     "What mean you, father?"

     "That the strnager, of whom you speak so highly, is to be your future
husband; the preserver of the father will not act unkindly by the child."

     "My father, I am stunned."

     "Yes, my dear daughter, I have fully settled this matter in my own 
mind;
he has asked your hand-- go see him-- you have my blessing.  I am sure he 
will
be happy.  Isabella, you never disobeyed your father; such an act would be 
the
cruelest stab that ever was planted in my bosom."

     "But when," said Isabella, almost trembling; "but when will this be?
When am I to be given away, father, as you would a present of flowers?"

     "Isabella, when have I deserved, when have I had such an answer from
thee?  Let me have no more of this."

     "But when have you fixed as a time upon which I am to be sent away from
home to strangers?"

     "You will not leave this palace, Isabella; you and your husband will
always be here, and I shall have the satisfaction of seeing the happiness I
have planned and made.  He will be a father to the child, as well as a
husband."

     "I do not wish for any such change.  I am happy, but shall be 
otherwise,
if I am compelled to wed."

     "Compelled, Isabella, compelled!  Do you speak of being forced, when I
wish it?  Now that I have settled it in my own mind, love and duty to me, 
and
gratitude to this gentleman, all conspire to point out how you should act."

     "But when, father, when?"

     "To-morrow."

     "To-morrow!" repeated Isabella, in mornful accents.

     "Yes, my child; 'tis better done at once-- 'twill, at all events, save
any of those unnecessary thoughts that might disturb you."

     "My father! my father!" said the young lady, as she sunk upon her knees
before him.

     "Well, my child?"

     "Pardon me for once begging a favour of you."

     "What mean you by such words?"

     "I wish a longer interval to be allowed me before I am-- I am----"

     "Married," said her father.

     "Yes, father; that is the dreadful word."

     "Isabella, mind, my love, what my wishes are."

     "I have heard them, father; but give me a week-- indeed, you cannot
decently bring this matter to a conclusion before the end of that time.  I
have had no previous warning fom you, or this stranger, that such a thing 
was
in contemplation."

     "If I grant it you, my Isabella, I must be obeyed."

     "You shall be obeyed, father," said Isabella, with an effort, "if it 
cost
me my life, and it will be near it; but let me keep my room until that 
period
is up, and then do with me what you will."

     "Be it so, Isabella; though it will look ungracious to our guest, yet I
will endeavour to excuse you with the best grace I can."

     The Lady Isabella was deathly pale, and, as she rose, she staggered, 
and
could scarce support herself out of the apartment.

THE WEDDING MORNING. -- THE NEW ARRIVAL. -- THE DISAPPERANCE OF THE VAMPYRE
BRIDEGROOM.


     The signora retired to her own chamber, and remained there for many
hours; but during that time two messengers had left the mansion secretly, 
and
then all was still.  The lovely and beautiful Isabella, however, was not to
be seen in her usual walks, or at her father's board, as was her wont.  She
was only seen within the precincts of her own apartments, pallid, sad, and
sorrowful.

     "Your daughter, count," said the stranger, one morning, "does not 
appear
as usual.  I trust she is quite well?"

     "Yes; quite well."

     "I hope I have given no cause of offence if so, I hope I may be 
informed
of my error, that I may speedily amend it."

     "There is none, chevalier; but my daughter, Isabella, has asked a 
week's
preparation for the nuptials-- which week she will pass in her own 
apartments
secluded, and at the end of which time, she leaves them for your protection,
and which will, I trust, be to her happiness."

     "It shall be my business to make her happy, and, for want of good will
and hearty endeavour, she shall never lack content and bliss.  I have every
presage of a most happy and felicitous life in the future.  I am sure she 
will
be happy."

     "It is my great hope, chevalier; it is the one object of my life.  I
would it were settled, and the affair over.  I should die unhappy if I 
thought
poor Isabella in the hands of any one who would not use her as she deserved 
to
be.  She is of herself a treasure."

     "She is-- she is."

     "And when she is once a wife, she will not look for a father's
protection, neither will she need it.  My death, when it does happen, will 
be
a great and heavy blow; but it will be less when she has the comfort and
consolation of a husband to console her for what would otherwise be
irreparable."

     "Yes, it would have the effect of deadening the blow, and of shortening
the duration of its intensity, though it will be by no means prevented."

     "I cannot say I should desire it."

     "No, certainly not; and Signora Isabella never could forget such a
parent."

     "I have done my duty, I hope."

     "And many congratulate yourself, count; but then, with regard to
Isabella, she will meet me as usual here on the day of the ceremonial"

     "Most assuredly."

     "And I am to be denied her company till then?"

     "Yes; she will meet you on the morning at the altar."

     "Be it so-- but I could have been happy in her society.  At any rate I
must be so, by reflecting that I shall soon be the favoured, happy husband 
of
Isabella, for with her my happiness will be complete."

     "And my happiness will be complete, in knowing her's is so."

     "I could have wished that some of those who have known me in France had
been here to see my happiness; but that cannot be."

     "Could you not send to them?"

     "There would not be time for their return.  And, moreover, if there had
been, I question whether I ought to hold any communication with them, lest I
bring them under the ban of the government, and I may not do that."

     "Truly, you have the same feelings as I used to have; but I have long
since ceased to feel any of that kind of interest."

     "Time cures that."

     "It does; and you will find it will heal all those wounds which such a
separation from your country causes you."

     "I hope so.  My offences there they will never forgive."

          *             *             *             *             *

     Thus conversed the stranger and the count, and thus six days passed,
during which time the Signora Isabella was seen by none save her attendants,
who were few, and most of her time was spent in tears and prayers.

     She had a heart full of grief, but whe dared not disobey her father, he
whom she loved so well, and whom she had never thought for one moment as 
being
opposed to her own ideas of propriety and her own wishes.  She had always 
been
taught to suppress her own, and submit to his.

     Thus it was now, at the eleventh hour, she had no means of fortifying
herself in any preconceived liking she may have had.

     Submission was all she had learned-- a blind and willing submission to 
a
fond and doating parent.  She knew no other course of action.

     Her heart, however, had other yearnings.  She had loved another; but 
she
knew not how to act.  She dared not even entertain the thought of throwing
herself at her father's feet, and imploring him to save her from perpetual
sorrow -- much less did she think of opposing him; but she had done this 
much.

     In the first moment of her terror and anguish, she had written off to 
her
brother, informing him of her danger; but, at the same time, she had advised
nothing, and expressed no wish -- only told him the fact and her fears.

          *             *             *             *             *

     The wedding morning arrived, and the house of the count gave 
indications
of the festivity; and, with the day, came guests richly dressed, and the 
bells
rang a merry peal upon the occasion, and the count was in high spirits; but
the bride was not seen.

     "How is Signora Isabella, your daughter?" inquired one of the guests.

     "She is as well as maiden modesty will permit."

     "I have not seen her."

     "Nor I."

     "Nor you!" replied the guest, astonished.

     "No; she has secluded herself, but will appear presently, when the bell
rings for the service.  The fact is, she cannot leave her father, even for 
the
arms of a husband, without feeling a grief for the change."

     "I hope she will be happy."

     "I have no doubt of it; the man is worthy of her."

     "And capable of making her happy, I hope."

     "I have no doubt of that."

     "Hark! the bell sounds; is that the signal?"

     "Yes; follow on.  I will bring my daughter forth;" and, as he spoke, he
left the guests, who hurried to the chapel, and found the stranger awaiting
his bride with some impatience.

     He acknowledged the courtesy of those who came to him, and looked 
towards
a small door, which presently opened, and the count and his daughter 
appeared.
She was of marble paleness, and no signs of happiness were seen in her face.
She trembled, and her whole soul seemed to be intent on something afar from
her presence.

     She lifted her eyes and gazed upon the throng; but apparently saw none 
--
or not those whom she wished.  Her father spoke to her; she heaved a deep
sigh, and appeared to be resigned to her fate.

          *             *             *             *             *

     The ceremony commenced, and Isabella stood; but her eyes occasionally
sought the chapel door; and in a few moments more, before the important part
was concluded, a bustle took place near the door, and, immediately 
afterwards,
some officers, in the Venetian uniform, entered the chapel, among whom was 
the
young count, Isabella's brother, and with him a young officer, into whose 
arms
she instantly threw herself, and fainted.

     "Father," said the young count -- "father, this must not be."

     "Why not, my son?" said the count.

     "Because my sister loves another, and yon man is a monster."

     "What mean you, sir?" said the chevalier.  "If you were other than what
you are, your words would beget a different answer."

     "You are a vampyre," replied a young Neapolitan, who stepped forward.  
"I
knew you before.  Know you not the holy father whom you murdered?"

     "'Tis false.  I'll bring one to prove it."

     As the chevalier spoke, he crossed the chapel, and left the place; but 
he
did not appear again; and, upon inquiry, he had quitted the palace in a
gondola, and never reappeared.

 Next Time: The Two Highwaymen. -- The Murder at the Gibbet's Foot. -- The
 Ride to the Golden Pippin.




                             CHAPTER CLXVI [sic]

                               [Chapter 174]

THE TWO HIGHWAYMEN. -- THE MURDER AT THE GIBBET'S FOOT. -- THE RIDE TO THE
GOLDEN PIPPIN.


     The evening set in a stormy mood; sudden, gusty showers rattled against
the traveller; whilst the wind swept over the country, bending the tall 
trees,
and whistlng round the peasant's cot, and making the chimneys appear as if
they were the residences of imprisoned spirits, which moaned and groaned 
most
dismally to hear.

     The clouds came rapidly across the sky; now darkening the earth, and 
now
they had fled past, leaving the moonbeams pouring a flood of light upon the
fields and roadways; but this was soon followed by another darkness, a cold
rain, and rushing wind, the night being inclement and very boisterous -- not
to say a night too bad to permit travelling.

     It was late on such a night, when down a lone cross-road a single
horseman might be seen to ride slowly and carefully.  He was wrapped up in a
large cloak, and rode a powerful horse, and appeared to be somewhat tired.

     There was much difficulty in travelling over a bad road, that was loose
and shifty, with here and there a slough of some magnitude.

     In a very wild and desolate spot stood a mound of stones that had been
heaped at the foot of a gibbet, and had been collected there in consequence 
of
the unpopularity of the occupant of the instrument of punishment.

     On the gibbet, swinging to and fro, was the body of a malefactor, hung 
in
chains -- an awful and disgusting spectacle -- whose death no one regretted,
inasmuch as he was the terror of the whole neighbourhood.

     It was the body of a highwayman, or of a robber, who had committed all
kinds of depredations, and several murders.  He was the son of a person of
property, but addicted to vicious courses, and, to support them, he had
recourse to robbery and murder.

     Several of his former friends were robbed, and at length his own father
fell by his hands, when he refused to give up his purse in the road at this
spot.  His own son shot him through the heart.

     This was the last crime he ever committed; for he was taken and tried,
when enough was proved that would have hung a hundred men; and there was not
one man who could, or who would, speak one word in his favour.  He was
executed; and so detested was he by all, that every one who came by this 
spot
threw a stone, until it grew, by these means, a goodly heap, which remained 
a
memento of their hate.

     It was this spot the stranger was nearing, and to which he appeared to
look up with some degree of either curiosity, or interest; but, before he 
got
there, there was another horseman riding along the country lane, and who 
would
arrive there about the same time as the first; but when he came there, it 
was
easy to perceive that he was not alone, but another horseman was in waiting
beneath some trees, and hidden from the traveller.

     In a few moments more, the traveller reached the spot, and, looking up 
at
the dead body that was swinging to and fro in the night air, the other
horseman rode up; upon which the traveller was about to push his horse 
forward
at an increased speed, when he found that there was not space enough.

     "Which side do you take?" he inquired of the stranger.

     "Stand and deliver!" was the reply.

     "That is uncivil," replied the stranger, "and a request that I do not
feel at all disposed to consent to."

     "Deliver your money and a pocket-book, or you are a dead man."

     "Nay," said the stranger; "I have means of defence, too."

     And, as he spoke, he pulled out a bright, double-barrelled pistol, 
which
he levelled and cocked, saying, as he very leisurely did so, --

     "Beware! you are playing with a determined man.  I am not disposed to
play.  Get out of my way, or you are a dead man!"

     "Ha, ha, ha!" laughed the other, and made way at the same moment, thus
bringing himself alongside the traveller, leaving him room to go on.  "You 
are
not to be frightened-- well, well, go on."

     The traveller put his spurs to his horse, but at the same moment 
received
a bullet from the treacherous highwayman.

     "Ha!" cried the traveller, putting his hand to his side, and in a 
moment
more he staggered and fell over the side of the horse on to the ground.

     "Ha, ha, ha!" said the highwayman, who immediately dismounted; but 
before
he could search the body, the other horseman came up at a gallop.

     "Well, Fred, have you quieted him?"

     "I have."

     "Resisted, then?"

     "Yes.  Have you got your lantern?"

     "Yes; but it is not yet lighted.  But that is soon done."

     "Then let us have it as quick as you can; for he has fallen down here 
in
a slough, and I should like to get the money without more mire than I am
obliged to put up with."

     "Here it is," said the other, handing the lantern -- a small one, which
he had lighted by means of some chemical matches.

     The highwayman took the lantern, and, after some examination, he 
secured
the pocketbook and the purse, and having done this, he examined the fingers,
but saw no rings and no watch, and he said to his companion, --

     "Just come here.  Did you ever see such a set of features as these?  
They
are truly strange and singular; I could never forget them."

     "Indeed!  I must have a look at them," said his companion, dismounting
and bending over the body; and when he looked at them, he said, --

     "I saw that man to-day where I dined, and thought he took the other 
road,
and there waited for him."

     "Did you, though?"

     "Yes, till I was tired; and then I came across the country in search of
you, but did not expect you to have any quarry."

     "Did you ever see such a countenance? it is most strange and ghastly."

     "Yes, it is; but he has died a violent death, you see, and therefore
there is much to be done by way of allowance."

     "Yes, yes, I know all that; but the nose, mouth, and teeth----"

     "They are not the most agreeable in the world, certainly.  Well, well, 
it
don't matter; you have done all your business with him, have you not?"

     "I have got all, I believe," said the other.  "He has no watch or 
chain--
not even a ring has he got on his finger."

     Perhaps you'll find enough in his purse and pocket-book to console you;
though I must say, Ned, that he dined very sparingly.  But no matter the
amount; ride on, for you know it is not a good plan to stand longer here 
than
necessary; for we may have other riders down upon us."

     "Not very likely, on this road, and as this hour; but 'tis bad.  I'm 
off,
and he will remain behind till found by some frightened peasant or other, 
who
will go to the nearest market town, with a frightful account."

     "Ride away; I hear horses' feet, I think."

     "I am ready; forward! ho!"

     The two highwaymen rode off at a rapid rate, conversing as they went; 
but
yet it was in suppressed tones for some distance; and after some riding, one
of them pulled up his horse, partially, saying, --

     "Well, I don't think it wise we should thus wear our steeds out; there 
is
no need of our riding for life; our horses never ought to be put to there
[sic] mettle, unless there be plenty of occasion, which there is not."

     "No-- all is right, to-night."

     "Have you done much lately, Ned?"

     "No; I have been rather upon the seek than find; I have been looking 
out
brightly, but have not been successful."

     "I have myself only done moderately; but I have done better than I 
should
have done, because I was fortunate enough to come across a fat grazier who 
had
more money than any three or four persons I have met lately."

     "Your fortune is somewhat like mine."

     "You have met with little good then, Ned."

     "Indeed, I have not; but it is a long lane that has no turning,"

     "Yes; indedd, it is."

     "However, I hope this queer-looking customer will reward one for one's
pains; if you can but keep the game a going, you are sure to succeed in the
end; 'tis only two years or better since I first began to ride."

     "That is, put a period to other people's rising."

     "Exactly."

     "Well, then, where do you intend to put up for the night? for I suppose
you do not intend to stay out all night any more than myself."

     "No; I think of going on until I come to 'The Golden Pippin,'  where I
intend to stay for the night.  The landlord can wink hard at his friends, 
and
not know they are in the house, or he can tell them a thing if they want to
know anything at all to their interest."

     "He's the sort of man; I know him.  I was thinking of going there; I
don't know better or snugger quarters than are to be had at his hostel."

     "Then we'll have a good supper and a bottle at 'The Golden Pippin.'"

     "With all my heart; but you don't think there'll be any danger of our
being pursued for this matter."

     "Oh, dear, no; the direct road lies another way, and we shall be quite
fifteen miles from the spot where the body lies."

     "So far."

     "Yes; we have come over the ground very rapidly, and have gone more 
than
two-thirds of that distance.  When we get there we shall be safe, easy, and
comfortable; and right good wines are there to be had at 'The Golden 
Pippin.'"

 Next Time: The Horrors of the Night. -- The Discovery in the Road. --
 Contention Between Man and Horse. -- Comfortable Quarters in the Golden
 Pippin.



                            CHAPTER CLXVII [sic]

                               [Chapter 175]

THE HORRORS OF THE NIGHT. -- THE DISCOVERY IN THE ROAD. --  CONTENTION 
BETWEEN
MAN AND HORSE. -- COMFORTABLE QUARTERS IN THE GOLDEN PIPPIN.


     The malefactor's body swung to and fro on the gibbet, and the chains
squeeked and groaned as the wind impelled the body's motions.  The wind 
itself
whistled heedlessly by, and the transient, but heavy shower passed on,
heedless of the deed of blood that had been perpetrated beneath its monitory
shadow.

     Now and then there was a little light, and then the body might be seen
heaped up, and lying in the mud and mire, which was all discoloured with the
blood of the fallen man -- he was motionless.  The rain fell on him, but it
mattered not -- the body felt it not.  The wind blew the cloak about, but 
the
body remained quiet, and nothing appeared to spare the body.

     There was no one nigh; that was a lonely spot, and that was tenanted by
two dismal gipsys.  The body of the malefactor swang to and fro while the 
body
of the murdered traveller lay quit enough.

     The clouds travelled across the face of the moon, and intercepted her
light from the earth; but yet it was light enough at intervals to enable the
traveller to see his way on foot, or on horseback.

     About two hours after that in which the traveller had been stopped and
murdered, there came another individual riding towards the scene.

     This was a countryman -- a grazier, who was well-mounted, and came 
along
at a rapid rate, having a stout trotting nag under him.

     When he neared the spot where the murder had been committed, he gave a
look up at the disagreeable object -- the gibbet, and when he had done so, 
he
put the spur to his horse's side, with the intenetion of going by at a
quickened pace, exclaiming as he did so, --

     "This is no pleasant place at nine o'clock at night.  I wish I were at
the Golden Pippin, instead of here."

     As he spoke, he pushed his horse, as he manifested a design to stop; 
but
the animal, instead of going past, reared up.

     "Hilloa! brute.  What art after now, eh?"

     The spur was again applied, but the animal only became more and more
unmanageable, and the rider near losing his seat; but he was, nevertheless,
the more anxious to get onward, for the neighbourhood was not pleasant; 
added
to which, it was a wet and dismal night, and late for a cross-road.

     "Curse you!" muttered the grazier; "what the deuce is the matter with
you? -- did you never see the gibbet before?  If thee hadn't, I should not
have been surprised at thee shying at the man swinging on the gibbet; but 
thee
hast done so, and now thee art frightened.  Whoa! d--n thee."

     He made another attempt to force the horse by, but it was fruitless, 
and
he was at length unseated into the mire.

     "D---n!" muttered the man; "the first time I have been thrown these ten
years, drunk or sober, and now I am sober."

     This was apparently the first reflection that came to his mind after 
the
first effect of the concussion; he then scratched his head, adjusted his 
hat,
and was getting up, when for a moment his eyes rested on something dark 
lying
in the middle of the road, and at which his horse had in reality shyed.

     "Oh!" he exclaimed, with a visible alteration in his demeanour; "that's
what Peg shied at, eh?  What the devil is it?"

     As he muttered these words, his hair began to stand on end; and the 
more
he looked, the greater his apprehension; for he began to think what he 
wished
was further from the fact, though his notions were far from being definite,
and he did all he could to dispel the rising terror.

     "Why-- it ain't-- no, it can't be-- and yet it must be!  What makes 'un
lay there-- he must be dead, surely!"

     Thrice he scrambled to his feet, and then walked a little towards the
object against which his horse stood smelling and snorting with evident 
signs
of fear.

     "Woa, brute!  What's the matter with thee? -- confound thee!  But I
suppose thee wast frightened."

     As the man spoke, he walked up to the animal, and, taking the bridle, 
he
passed it over his arms, and then approached the body.

     "Aye, sure enough, he's insensible-- if not dead, poor fellow!  What 
can
be done-- there's no one near at hand to lend assistance?"

     He paused to consider what was to be done, when it occurred to him as
being the most likely thing that could be done was to probe the unfortunate
man; he could not say whether he was dead or alive, from his positon in the
middle of the road.

     "If 'un ain't dead," he argued, "he would come to no harm; for it 
wasn't
every horse that cared as much for a man as Peg did; they might get run 
over,
or cause some desperate accident."

     Having made up his mind what to do, he secured Peg, and turned his
attention to the body of the stranger, which had been left on its back, with
its face upwards, but the wind had blown the cloak over it, and it was not
seen by the grazier, who now essayed to move the body.

     After some trouble, he succeeded in dragging him there, and propping 
him
up against the bank, upon which grew a stunted hedge, and, when there, he
opened the cloak, and looked upon the features of the dead man.

     "Well," he muttered; "I never yet saw such a face!  I am sure I can 
never
forget that.  Of all the ill-looking thieves, he is the worst! but much, I
suppose, must be set off on the fact that he is a dead man, and a murdered
one, to boot."

     There was a strange markedness in the style of features in the dead 
man,
that gave no pleasing impression to the mind; it was one that could not
easily be forgotten, especially accompanied by all the horrors of their 
place
and circumstances.

     "He has been shot, no doubt," he muttered.  "This must be all blood.
Aye! in in [sic] the breast, or thereabouts.  Oh! he is dead.  Well, I'll 
ride
to the Golden Pippin, and then I'll give them notice of it."

     He was just about to turn and mount his horse, when the clouds parted,
and the moonbeams, for a few moments, came upon the body, without any
hindrance, and the grazier thought he saw a movement.

     "It must have been gammon,"he muttered.  "I'll be off-- I'm quite cold
and shivery here.  I'll go to the Golden Pippin, and get some good cheer, 
for
I'm terribly shaken.  Eh! what was that?  The devil!"

     The latter exclamations were uttered in consequence of the figure 
turning
towards the moon's rays, and then opening its eyes, which had such an effect
upon the unfortunate man, that he staggered back terrified.

     "Lord have mercy!" he ejaculated.  "What's-- what's that?  He-- he's
coming too-- [sic] hilloa, friend! -- how are you?"

     The figure turned his large motionless eyes upon the terrified man, and
they had such an effect upon him, that, despite all he could do to rally
himself, he sprang involuntarily to his horse's back, and galloped off
furiously.

          *             *             *             *             *

     It was scarce an hour before this occured, when the two highwaymon 
[sic]
rode up to the Golden Pippin.

     "Hilloa! hilloa! ostler-- here!" shouted one of them, and in a few
moments more the ostler came out, willing enough.

     "Hilloa, Jem! you are sharp to-night.  How is it you are not asleep?"

     "I was just going to roost, master; but I shall have a job instead, I 
can
see."

     "You will; but not an empty handed affair, this time; take care of the
nags, and there's a crown for you."

     "Thank you, master-- you are always generous."

     "When I can, Jem; but what company have you in the house?"

     "Little to speak of," said the ostler; "about three or four people, as
lives about here; but nobody that I know-- anybody or anything-- only people
that have to earn their own living; they are in the kitchen."

     "Good fire?"

     "Yes."

     "Then we will go there, too," said the highwayman; "it's a raw cold
night, and one in which a good super and a good fire will do one good."

     The two highwaymen then entered the house, and walked into the kitchen,
which was a large room, with beams across the top, and a variety of utensils
proper to the place; but the grand feature was the large fire-place, in 
which
burned brightly some good logs, and threw a glowing warmth and bright light
over the whole apartment, in which, however, was one candle, as if to be
mocked by the light of the fire.  The use of this solitary wick was to 
enable
the smokers to light their pipes without stirring, and also to be taken away
at a moment's notice for any purpose that might be needed.

     The three guests turned their attention to the new comers, without,
however, exchanging one word, and the landlord himself arose.

     "Oh, landlord," said one of the highwaymen, "I'm glad you have a good
fire; 'tis one of the best things, after a cold ride, a man can have met
with."

     "Except a good hot supper, and a cup afterwards," said his companion.

     "All these are very good things in their way, gentlemen," said the
landlord, emptying the ashes of his pipe out into the fireplace by tapping 
the
pipe on the toe of his shoe, and thus dropped the ashes out of danger.

     "You are right, landlord," said the other.

     "But I always, think, gentlemen," said the landlord gravely, "that they
are always a great deal better when they can be had together-- they are 
better
for their company's sake-- the one helps the other."

     "So they do."

     "Well, then, let us have them all, old cock, as soon as you please, for
we are both cold, tired, and hungry."

     "And they are the best accompaniments you can have as a preparatory for
all that is to follow."

     "Amen! and about it," said the highwayman.

     The two new guests sat themselves down in one quarter of the kitchen, 
and
near to a table facing the fire, where they could enjoy its genial warmth,
which they appeared to do with much gusto.

     Having opened their coats, and taken off their shawls, removed their
hats, and sat down in a comfortable manner, they began to look about them.

     "Well, Ned, we have made a good exchange."

     "How do you mean?"

     "Why, we have exchanged the road to comfortable quarters, which, you
will, at least, admit, is all the better."

     "Yes, much better; though I have ridden many a long and weary a night
before now, with the runners at my heels."

     "Ay-- ay, so have I; but hush-- say no more of that there.  I have no
idea of letting these blacks suspect anything; they are what you call honest
men, and men who would give a clue in a moment, if they thought it was
wanted."

     "I dare say it is so, Ned; but what are you going to have for supper?"

     "I don't know.  Landlord, what can we have for supper-- anything hot?"

     "Why," said the landlord, "I can kill a couple of chickens and brander
them, or there is some chicken pie, and a cold ham."

     "Well, what do you say, Ned?"

     "Can't you make the chicken pie warm?"

     "It is warm now," said the landlord.  "I can't make it quite hot 
without
doing too much; 'tis uncommon good, and has not long been put by from 
supper;
it was made for supper, but there's a good half left."

     "Eh?  What do you say to chicken pie, Ned?"

     "With all my heart; chicken pie let it be, then," replied Ned.

     "Well, then, landlord, put the chicken pie on, flanked by the ham-- 
some
of your foaming October, you know."

     "Ay-- ay, sir; some with a head on, that would take a blacksmith's
bellows to blow off, it is so strong."

     "Ha-- ha-- ha! that's the strike for us."

     The landlord now arose, and set about getting the necessary articles, 
and
spreading them upon a table before the two guests, who were nothing loath to
see the expedition that he had made to please them.

     "I think," said the landlord, "you will say you never eat such 
chickens;
they are my hatching, and have been well fed; they have been well killed,
cooked, and I hope, will be well eaten."

     "That is our part of the business, landlord; and if they are such as 
you
speak of, why, you may depend upon our doing our duty by them."

     "And the ham is my own breeding and curing."

     "Better and better, -- and the October?"

     "Why, I am just going to get that.  What say you to a tankard?"

     "Yes, a foaming tankard."

     "Yes, gentlemen, I will obtain what you want; it is in beautiful
condition, and when chilled, will give you a cream as thick as new cheese; 
and
as mild as new milk,

 Next Time: The Grazier's Relation, and His First Terrors. -- The Effects of
 Good Cheer and the Sudden Interruption to a Pleasant Party.




                            CHAPTER CLXVIII [sic]

                               [Chapter 176]

THE GRAZIER'S RELATION, AND HIS FIRST TERRORS. -- THE EFFECTS OF GOOD CHEER
AND THE SUDDEN INTERRUPTION TO A PLEASANT PARTY.


     The landlord was not long gone for the October; he came back with a
placid smile and a smacking of his lips, when he shut the door behind him, 
and
then deliberately placing the candlestick down, he said, handing them the
tankard, --

     "There, gentlemen, if you find any better brewed than that in the three
adjoining counties, why, you may take measure for my coffin, for I won't 
live
after I am told there is any so good anywhere else."

     "We will not take your word, landlord," said one of the highwaymen,
putting the tankard to his lips, which act produced an approving nod from 
the
jolly landlord, who said, with much encouragement, --

     "That's right; never trust nobody; that's my motto, and I chalks it up
over the fire-place, and acts upon it-- try for yourself, and then you won't
be deceived.  What's your opinion upon that now, sir?"

     "Never drank its equal, ever here."

     "I thought you'd say so; it comes out of a particular cask-- one as I
puts by for myself; but you have ridden hard, and I thought a brew of an 
extra
strike would be an acceptable drink."

     "You are right.  It is cold and very wet.  I'm as tired as if I had
ridden far-- the wind has blown me about so."

     "Ah, don't you hear how it roars in the chimney?"

     "So it does.  What do you think of the brew, Ned-- ain't it first 
rate?"

     "Indeed it is: I never had any equal to it.  I tell you what, landlord,
it will make an excellent night-cap, for a man who has taken a glass or two 
of
this, would not be better able to keep his saddle."

     "No; it's lucky we intend putting up for the night here; you have 
beds."

     "Yes, good, and well aired."

     "That is capital.  Well, your chicken-pie is good, landlord, your ham
good, and the October excellent; and now--- what's that?"

     At that moment there was a sound of horses' feet galloping furiously
towards the houses; and they had not listened long before they came close to
the door, and then there was evidently a sudden pull up.

     "Hilloa! what is that?" said his companion.

     "I think it is somebody pulled up at the door," said the landlord;
"whoever they are they have come in haste."

     The two highwaymen half rose, but a look at each other caused them to
resume their seats, and in another moment there was a loud shouting, and a
call for the ostler; but there was no one at hand.

     "Where is that Jim got to-- I must go and see after him, at all events-
-
he won't come if I don't."

     So saying, he walked away whilst the guests remained silent watching 
the
actions of the two highwaymen.

     "It is but a single horseman," said the first.

     "No," said the other; "but still he may be mischievous; and yet I can
hardly think he would venture here at such a time; besides, it can't be 
known;
we are much better here than anywhere else."

     "I think so; we have nothing to fear."

     "Nothing."

     At that moment the landlord retired; and, at the same time, the door 
was
suddenly opened, and the grazier entered the kitchen.  He glanced around 
him,
much confused.  The fire and light, no doubt, had some share in that; but he
stared, and appeared terrified, and all splashed over.

     "Where's the ostler?" he cried out.

     "Here I be," said the worthy behind.

     "Look after my horse; he is very hardly ridden.  See to him, that's a
good fellow," said the grazier.["]

     "Yes; I'll see to 'un," said Jem, who departed with the animal.

     "Landlord-- landlord!"

     "Yes; here I am, Master Green-- here am I!"

     "Give me something strong; I'm half dead.  I'm cold, and I'm 
frightened,
and that is the truth.  Where's the fire?"

     "Why, Master Green, I never saw you in this state before.  Give me your
hand, Master Green.  I'll show you the fire," said the landlord, holding out
his hand to Green.  "Why, you are cold-- what has happened?"

     "You shall hear-- you shall hear," said the half-terrified Green.  
"Only
give me a toss of brandy, and get me a supper, and then I shall be able to
tell you more about it.  At present I can say nothing."

     "Well, that is pretty well for a man that can't speak," said the
landlord.  "You are getting better, Mr. Green."

     "I hope I shall; the fire is comfortable."

     "Here's some good brandy; take a gill, man.  It won't hurt you on such 
an
occasion as this.  I have seen you do as much before; but, as for supper, 
why
I can't say much.  These two gentlemen have had the only thing I had in the
house, and, save the ham, I doubt much if there will be any left."

     "If the gentlemen will join us, he is welcome to take a share of what 
we
have," said one of the highwaymen.  "Here will be enough for us all, I dare
say, sir, if you do not object to our company."

     "Thank you-- thank you," said Green.  "I will accept of your offer
gladly; for I have had a long ride, and have had much that is uncomfortable 
to
put up with, to see and to fear.  Lord have mercy on me say I!"

     "Well, what is the matter, Mr. Green?"

     "Why," said Mr. Green, as he, between his words, poked in large 
mouthfuls
of food, and now and then washed it down by the aid of the October.  "You 
all
of you know the highwayman's corner, about fifteen miles from here?"

     "Yes," said the landlord, "I know it well; there's a chap hanging up in
chairs there, now, at this present day, that is, if nobody hasn't run away
with it, or it hasn't been blown down."

     "Exactly.  Well, that's the spot; there's been another dreadful murder
been done there.  Oh! it was dreadful."

     "Well, did you see it?"

     "Yes; I did."

     "What! the murder!" said both highwaymen at once.

     "No; the body-- I only saw the body."

     "Where was it lying?"

     "Stop, stop a bit-- not so fast," said Mr. Green, who was eating very
fast indeed, but paused a moment.  "You must not ask too many questions at
once, because I have one way of telling a tale, and you'll spoil it."

     "Well, go on your own way."

     "Well, then, listen. I was coming along at a rattling pace, I can tell
you, for I was late, and tired, as it was.  When I had reached the gallows, 
I
looked up at the body swinging in the wind, and creaking and screaming on 
its
rusty swivels; but I had scarcely done so, when my horse shyed, and very
nearly landed me in the mud, but I contrived to keep my seat, though not
without trouble."

     "What! at the dead man?" inquired one of the highwaymen.

     "Aye," replied his companion.  "I am sure they ought not to put men up
there like scarecrows, to frighten horses with; for my part, I never pass it
but my horse snorts and bolts, and I am obliged to be wary."

     "I don't know much about that.  I have come by without my nag being any
the worse.  At all events, I thought there was something in his shying at 
the
gallows, and I tried to push him by, but he would not go."

     "What did you do?"

     "Why, I was obliged to get down," said the grazier.

     "Thrown?"

     "No, no."

     "Forced to get down, you mean," said the highwayman.

     "Why, in some sort of way I did feel myself compelled to get down,
because the brute wouldn't go a-head, and I saw something on the ground as 
the
clouds cleared away a little, and showed me that there was something
suspicious in the middle of the road, very much like a bundle of clothes."

     "Indeed!" said the landlord, "what was it?"

     "I'll tell you, in course.  Now, you see, I saw the animal would not
move, so I got off to see what was the matter."

     "Forced off," adde the highwayman.

     "D--n it, man, what can it matter; then I got off," said the grazier,
getting into a passion, and then, after a pause, which he employed in taking 
a
long pull at the October, and then wiping his lips, he continued, --

     "What is the matter now?" thought I; "so I went to the object, and 
found
it was a man rolled up in a cloak in the middle of the road, dead."

     "Dead?"

     "Aye, dead as a door nail."

     "Lor!" said the highwayman.  "Why, then he must have been murdered, I
suppose?"

     "You may take your davy of that," said the grazier; "but I tried to 
wake
him up, but he was not to be disturbed, so I dragged him to the bank, where 
I
left him."

     "Where was he hurt?"

     "Shot right in the side, or stabbed, I don't know which, but that's 
where
the blood came from, so I was sure he was dead; but when I removed the cloak
from his face, I saw he had as ugly a set of features as a man can desire-- 
a
long, peculiar face, large, but thin nose, an awkward set of teeth, with one
or two projecting in front, and oh! such eyes, that is when he opened them."

     "Opened them," said the highwayman; "both?"

     "Opened them," repeated the landlord; "why, did you not tell me he was
dead?"

     "Aye; but when the moonlight came upon him, he opened his eyes.  Oh! 
what
eyes-- why, they were like a pair of enormous great fish eyes-- cod's eyes,
that had become suddenly lighted up, or the moonlight reflected back from 
the
bottom of a new tin saucepan, and then you have 'em."

     "The devil," said the highwayman; "and what did you do?"

     "Why, I came away as fast as I could.  I wasn't to be done by a dead 
man.
I didn't wait to see more than that.  He turned round and stared at me.  He
was so horrible, that I got upon my horse the best way I could, and came on
here as fast as the animal would come."

     "The body, I dare say, rolled over, and you thought it moved of 
itself."

     "I know better; besides, it opened its eyes."

     "The moon shone on them, and you thought he looked at you.  You were
terror-stricken, and that is the truth of it."

     "Then I know better," said the grazier, doggedly; "it ain't anything of
the kind.  I know it ain't a matter that happens every day, and that's why 
you
don't believe it, and don't understand it, but I know I'm right."

     "House, here, house! ostler!" shouted a loud, authoritative voice 
without
the door of the inn, which caused them all to start and listen for a
repetition of the same sounds to prove that they were not illusory.

                               [Chapter 177]

THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER'S ARRIVAL. -- THE CONSTERNATION OF THE  GUESTS. -- 
THE
GRAZIER'S TERRORS, AND POWERS OF IDENTITY. -- THE LANDLORD'S DAUGHTER.


     "Hilloa! house! house! shouted the strange voice on the outside, but in 
a
tone that seemed unearthly; whether it were merely a fancy, or reality, yet 
it
had its effect, and the landlord sat staring vacantly with his two hands
resting on either knee, leaning forward as if he was staring some imaginary
object out of countenance.

     "Well," said one of the the highwaymen, "ain't anybody going to the
door."

     No one answered, but Jem the ostler was hastening by another passage to
the door, and then they heard some confused speaking, as if the stranger was
giving some directions for the care of his horse.

     The grazier was fixed in his attention to what was going on, and 
appeared
petrified, and held a morsel on the end of his fork, halfway between his 
mouth
and the plate, with his eyes directed towards the door.

     In a few moments more they heard the steps of some one approaching the
door, and one of the highwaymen said to his companion, --

     "Ned, there are people late on the roads to-night."

     "Yes; it appears so, but it is very uncomfortable travelling; the night
is bad, and the roads no better.  Who's this, I wonder?"

     "We shall now see," said the other, but their backs were turned towards
the door, and they could not see who entered the door so well as the 
grazier,
who sat in the same attitutde, without a motion or movement, even to wink 
his
eye, when the door opened, and in walked a tall man, wrapped in a horseman's
cloak.

     The expression of horror in the grazier's face, and the swelling of his
eyes almost out of his head, at once showed them there was something
extraordinary, and they both mutually turned round, and to their extreme
terror they perceived the very man, or his double, they had left dead upon 
the
spot where the grazier had seen him.

     Neither were they alone surprised, for all present were able at once to
recognise the same man without any difficulty.

     "It's the same man-- I'm d--d!" said the grazier, as if he had made an
effort to speak, and when he had so, he couldn't help himself.  Oh, Lord! --
who would have thought it? -- it's-- it's the-- the-- what do ye call it?"

     "The devil," suggested the landlord.

     "No," said the stranger, "no.  I am merely a traveller, somewhat weary
and tired-- do not disturb yourselves.  I am cold-- very cold-- the fire 
will
do me good; it is a very cold night-- the roads are bad very unsafe."

     "Very," said one of the highwaymen, involuntarily.

     "Did you speak?" inquired the stranger, suddenly turning to the
highwayman who had spoken with a look of such a peculiar character, that he
caused the bold roadster involuntarily to start; but he suddenly recovered
himself, and said, --

     "I did."

     "What did you say, sir?"

     "The same as you," replied the highwayman.

     The stranger made no reply to the highwayman, whose natural effrontery,
and the necessity he always had or presence of mind in circumstances of 
peril,
gave him a greater superiority than most men possessed under such
circumstances.

     "I'm not well," said the stranger.

     "Perhaps you've ridden far."

     "I have," replied the stranger.  "Landlord, will you have the goodness 
to
let me have some supper; I am weary."

     "I have only the remains of the chicken-pie and some ham," said the
landlord, looking black [sic] at the already referred-to chicken-pie, which,
thanks to its being made of great size, had already supped three hungry men,
-- "and there is but little of that."

     "It is not much that I want-- a small matter will suffice-- a little 
ham,
and something warm, and then I will to-bed-- 'tis late."

     "Very well, sir," said the landlord; "here's some good October; will 
you
like that? or is there anything else?  I have French spirits."

     "Then let me have some brandy."

     "Yes, sir, I'll fetch my daughter down stairs," said the landlord; 
"she's
young, and her hand is steadier than mine.  I shall upset the bottle; my-- 
my
hand, you see, is always unsteady after I've drawn the October; somehow or
other I always get out of order."

     "What is the reason of that?" inquired the highwayman.

     "Why, it's so strong; I believe it's nothing else whatever."

     As the landlord turned to go, he give another look at the guest, and
appeared greatly disturbed, and certainly thought him a strange and
unaccountable man; for he believed that he was in truth the very man spoken
of, who had been left for dead on the bank, near the foot of the gallows.

     "Mary," said the landlord, when he had ascended half a dozen stairs,
which led out of the kitchen, "Mary."

     "Yes, father," was the ready answer, in a clear, pleasing voice.

     "I want you, my dear.  Bring the brandy down-- the French-- the sealed
bottle; the other's out; I took the last this morning before breakfast."

     "Ho! ho!" siad the highwayman; "hark at our landlord, how early he must
begin-- no wonder his hand shakes."

     "Ah!" said the landlord, as he came back with a wink; "when you have 
been
a father and an innkeeper as long as I have, you'll do many things you don't
now dream of; but, no matter, I ain't as young as I used to be."

     At that moment a very pretty and genteel girl, about eighteen, 
descended
the stairs with a spirit bottle in her hand, and advanced to the table.

     "How will you take it, sir?" inquired the landlord.

     "Mixed."

     "Make a glass, my dear," said the landlord.

     "Is that your daughter?" inquired the stranger, fixing his eyes upon 
her,
-- and they were such leaden eyes, that the girl shrank from him in dismay.

     "Yes," said the landlord.

     "Any more?"

     "None," replied the landlord, and then there was a pause of some 
moments,
during which the stranger watched the young girl's motions with a greedy
jealousy, as if he feared to lose one movement, and in a manner that
especially annoyed the old landlord, who, however, could say nothing, he
having been quite cowed by the stranger's superiority in station and
demeanour; besides which, there was something very strange and peculiar, not
to say superhuman, about him that gave weight, and caused a kind of awe to
pervade all present, and they looked upon him as something fearful or
terrible.

     It was not long before the stranger ate his supper-- it was soon done; 
he
ate but little, and, when that was done, he turned to the brandy and water;
but there appeared an air of compulsion, upon his part, as if everything he
took was taken under the feeling that it was absolutely necessary to take
something, which did not escape the discerning eyes of all present, 
especially
the landlord, who felt it a slight upon himself and his cheer.

     "If I had known you were coming here," said the landlord, "I would have
got something ready for you, but, as it was, I had nothing but 'pot-luck' 
for
you."

     "What is that?" inquired the stranger. -- "What is that? -- I never 
heard
of such a dish before.  I am a stranger in these parts."

     "Oh, it only means you could have anything what is in the house."

     "It will do," said the stranger, quietly.

     "Will you have anything more that we have in the house?"

     "Nothing.  I came by the gibbet, not far from this place; and I met 
with
an accident there that has left me but little stomach.

     "By gosh, I should think not," muttered the grazier; "it would have
settled my stomach altogether, and anybody else's."

     "Well," muttered one of the highwaymen, "It would have left me no
stomach, save what would be in a fair way to become food for the worms."

     "What kind of accident was it, sir?"

     "A terrible blow in the side; it seemed to go through me."

     "Well, well, I imagine there would be but little comfort in a man's
bowels after he had anything go through his side."

     "It depends upon the constitution," said the stranger, "quietly." [sic]

     "The what?" inquired one of the highwaymen, incredulously.

     "The constitution," replied the stranger, quietly[.]

     There was a pause for some minutes, during which the strangers 
exchanged
glances at each other, when one of the highwaymen said, --

     "Perhaps a bullet put in your side might be no hidrance to your animal
economy, and would in the course of nature become digested."

     "Why, I dare say it would not hurt me so much as many; but it would 
take
me some little while to recover the shock, which would be great; but I am
unwell, and perhaps had better retire.  Will the young female, your 
daughter,
act as my chambermaid and show me my room?'" [sic]

     "Yes," said the landlord, mechanically; "here, Mary, show the gentleman
into No. 6, and leave the light."

     "Good night," said the stranger, rising, and walking away erect, but
slowly, from the group, who gazed after him with amazement.

     "Good night, sir," said the landlord, which was echoed by those 
present;
and, when the stranger was gone, there was a general release in their
conversation from the constraint which the presence of the last comer
occasioned.

     "Well, what do you think of him, Mr. Green?" inquired the landlord.

     "The very same man I saw on the bank at the gallows corner."

     "Are you sure?"

     "Quite."

     There was a general pause, as if there was something for them all to
think over; and their thoughts appeared to be so unsatisfactory, that those
who lived close at hand left the house, and those that remained there went 
to
their respective beds, and in half an hour the house was quite silent.

                               [Chapter 178]

THE MIDNIGHT CRY OF ALARM. -- THE VAMPYRE'S MEAL. -- THE CHASE ACROSS THE
FIELDS. -- THE DEATH OF THE LANDLORD'S DAUGHTER.


     The old inn was in a state of repose; its various parts were no longer
vexed by the busy tramp of men, the noisy voice of the toper, or the 
untiring
hands of the housewife, who does not spare any part of its edifice from her
ablutions.  The brush and the broom are sad intruders and disturbers, and 
yet
they are in perpeutal requisition.  However, the inhabitants were all 
steeped
in slumber.

     Among those who lay in that house, there was not one, except one, 
indeed,
who did not lie down to rest, and fall into a deep sleep; but that one
exception was the stranger, who appeared to have other views.

     He threw himself into a chair, and there appeared to meditate upon the
clouds which passed across the sky, in endless variety of shape and form.  
He
sat motionless, and still his large, lustreless eyes were fully opened, and 
he
was gazing earnestly for nearly an hour without motion.

     At length, as if his attention was of itself wearying to continue so
long, he moved, then sighed deeply, or rather groaned.

     "How long is this hated life to last?" he muttered.  "When shall I 
cease
to be the loathsome creature I am?"

     There was some reflection in this that was very bitter to him.  He
shuddered, and buried his face in his hands, and remained in that state for
some minutes; but then he lifted his head up agian, and turned towards the
moon's rays, muttering, --

     "But I am faint; I feel the want of my natural slumbers.  Blood alone
will restore me my strength.  There is no resisting the dreadful appetite 
that
goads me on.  I must-- I must-- I will satisfy it."

     He arose suddenly, and drew himself up to his full height, and threw
aloft his arms, as he growled out these words with frantic energy; but in a
few seconds he became more calm, and said, --

     "I saw the maiden enter the room next to mine.  I can enter it by the
same door, for I have the key, and that will place her at my mercy.  Good
fortune for once avail me, and then my wants will be satisfied."

     He walked softly to his own door, and undid it stealthily, and listened
for some minutes.

     "They are all asleep," he said -- "all, save one.  I alone walk through
the place.  All are in peaceful slumbers, while I, like the creatures of 
prey,
seek those whom I may devour.  I must on."

     He crept into the passage, and advanced to the door of the young girl,
who lay soundly sleeping in innocence and peace, little dreaming of the fate
that awaited her -- much less did she think that the destroyer was so close 
at
hand.

     She might, indeed, have dreamed that there was some one in the house 
who
was scarcely of her nature -- one that was loathsome and dreadful -- one 
who,
in fact, lived upon the blood of the innocent and fairest.

     "She sleeps," he muttered -- "she sleeps!"

     He listened again, and then he gently put the key into the door, and
found that it was not locked, and then, turning the handle, he found there 
was
some impediment to its opening; but of what character he could not tell.

     "'Tis unlucky; but this must be moved."

     He place his hand and foot close to the door, and pressed it gradually
and hardly against it, and he found that it gradually gave way, and that the
impediment gave by degrees, and that, too, with hardly any noise.

     "Fortune favours me," he muttered; "she does not hear me.  I shall win
the chamber, and shall, before she can wake up, sieze upon the dear
life-stream that is no less precious to me than to herself."

     He now had succeeded in effecting an entrance inot the room, and found
that it was only an easy chair that had been placed against the door, 
because
there was no other means of securing it, the key having unaccountably
disappeared, and left her without any other means of securing her door.

     "I will lock it," he muttered; "if I be disturbed, I shall be better 
able
to escape, and I shall be safe.  My meal will be undisturbed; at least not
before so much has been taken as will revive my strength."

     He now approached the bed, and with eager eyes devoured the fair form 
of
the youthful and innocent sleeper.

     "How calm, and how unsuspicious she lies," he muttered; "'twere a pity,
but I must, I must-- there is no help."

     He leaned over her.  He bent his head till his ear almost touched the
lips of the sleeper, as though he were listening to the breathing of the 
young
girl.

     Something caused her to start.  She opened her eyes, and endeavoured to
rise up, but she was immediately thrust back, and the vampire seized her 
fair
flesh with his fanged teeth, and having fleshed them, he was drawing that 
life
current from her which ensanguined them both.

     Horror and fright for a moment deprived her of strength, or the power 
of
uttering a sound of any kind; but when she did do so, it was one wild
unearthly shriek, that was heard throughout the whole house, and awakened
every human being within it in a moment.

     "Help! murder, murder!" she shrieked out, as soon as the first scream
subsided, and she regained breath.

     These cries she uttered rapidly, as well as attempting a desperate
resistance to her persecutor; but she was growing gradually more and more
faint.

          *             *             *             *             *

     The landlord had just got out of an uncomfortable dream about some
strange adventure he was having with some excisemen when he was young, when
the heart-piercing shriek of Mary came upon him.

     "God bless me," he muttered, "what's that?  I never heard anything so
horrible in all my life.  What can it be?"

     He sat up in bed, and pulled his nightcap off, while he listened, when 
he
heard the cries of help issuing from his daughter's room.

     "Good God! it's Mary," he muttered, "What can be the matter?"

     He did not pause a moment, but huddled on his clothes, and then rushed
out of his room with a light, to his daughter's bedroom.

     "What is the matter?" inquired one of the highwaymen, who had been
disturbed by the dreadful shriek.

     "I don't know; but-- but help me."

     "Help you to what?"

     "To burst open this door; 'tis my daughter's room, and the noise comes
from that place.  Hark!"

     "Help, help!" said a faint voice.

     "Damnation!" said the highwayman, "something's wrong there; somebody's
sucking; surely the stranger is not there?"

     "Burst the door open."

     "Then lend a hand; it must give," said Ned; and they all three made a
rush at the door, and in it went, for their weight carried it all before 
them,
and they all three went into the apartment without any hindrance, for the
frail lock gave immediately, and the other impediment only served to add to
the noise.

     Though they went in easily, yet they did not do so quickly enough, for
they all rolled over each other, and before they could rise they distinctly
saw the figure of the stranger start up and rush out of the room with Mary 
in
his arms.

     "Help! help! mercy!" she shrieked out.

     "'Tis she," said the landlord.

     "Mary----"

     "Yes, after her boys-- after her; for Heaven's sake, after her."

     "We will not leave her," said the highwaymen in concert, and at the 
same
moment all three rushed after her.

     "The stranger has made his way down into the kitchen, and I think he 
has
her with him," said the landlord.

     "I will after him," said Ned; "I saw her in his arms.  She was all over
blood.  Good Heavens! what can he mean? does he want to murder her?"

     "Help! help! murder!" shouted the girl, and at that moment they heard 
the
stranger attempting the kitchen door below.  In a moment they all three ran
down stairs as fast as they could, to seize the villain before he could
escape; but they had hardly got into the kitchen before they saw the door
swing to after him.

     "He's gone," said the landlord; "he's gone."

     "We'll after them; come on, never mind a chase; she's in white, and the
moon's up, so we shall have them in sight."

     "Away after them, lads; save my girl-- save my Mary!"

     Away they went with great speed, but the stranger somehow or other kept
ahead of them; his great height gave him an advantage in length of stride; 
but
then he bore the landlord's daughter in his arms, which was more than enough
to balance their powers; for though she was not heavy, comparatively 
speaking,
yet she was heavy to be borne along in this manner; but the stranger 
appeared
to possess superhuman strength, and moved along safely until they lost sight
of him among some hay-stacks, for which they made.

     "There, he's gone into Jackson's rick-yard," said the landlord; "get 
up;
push on; we may be yet in time to prevent mischief."

     The highwaymen ran hard; they had been out of breath for some time, and
cold hardly move their feet, but they made a sudden effort, or spirt, and 
away
they ran, and, in less than a minute, came up to the rick-yard." [sic]

     They rushed into the yard, and then beheld the stranger seated upon 
some
partially cut hay with the helpless maiden on his lap, but his fanged teeth
were fleshed in her fair neck, and he was exerting himself in drawing the 
life
stream from her veins.

     As soon as he saw the highwaymen he arose, and the unfortunate girl
rolled to the earth, and he started up and fled, the highwaymen firing a
parting shot after him, with pretty good aim, yet it took no effect.  The
landlord's daughter was picked up warm, but lifeless.  Whether it was in
consequence of her wound and loss of blood, which was doubted, or from sheer
fright, is not known, but the latter was considered most probable.

 Next Time: The Hotel. -- The Fashionable Arrival. -- The Young Heiress.




                             CHAPTER CLXXI [sic]

                               [Chapter 179]

THE HOTEL. -- THE FASHIONABLE ARRIVAL. -- THE YOUNG HEIRESS.


     Can it be true, and if so, how horribly strange, that a being half
belonging to a world of spirits, should thus wander beneath the cold moon 
and
the earth, bringing dismay to the hearts of all upon whom his strange malign
influence is cast!

     How frightful an existence is that of Varney the Vampyre!

     There were some good points about the -- man, we were going to say -- 
and
yet we can hardly feel justified in bestowing upon him that title, --
considering the strange gift of renewable existence which was his.  If it
were, as, indeed, it seemed to be the case, that bodily decay in him was not
the result of death, and that the rays "of the cold chaste moon" were
sufficient to revivify him, who shall say when that process is to end? and 
who
shall say that, walking the streets of giant London at this day, there may 
not
be some such existences?  Horrible thought that, perhaps seduced by the
polished exterior of one who seems a citizen of the world in the most 
extended
signification of the words, we should bring into our domestic circle a
vampyre!

     But yet it might be so.  We have seen, however, that Varney was a man 
of
dignified courtesy and polished manners; that he had the rare and beautiful
gift of eloquence; and that, probably, gathering such vast experience from 
his
long intercourse with society -- an intercourse which had extended over so
many years, he was able to adapt himself to the tastes and the feelings of 
all
persons, and so exercise over them that charm of mind which caused him to 
have
so dangerous a power.

     At times, too, it would seem as if he regretted that fatal gift of
immortality, as if he would gladly have been more human, and lived and died 
as
those lived and died whom he saw around him.  But being compelled to fulfil
the order of his being, he never had the courage absolutely to take measures
for his own destruction, a destruction which should be final in consequence 
of
depriving himself of all opportunity of resuscitation.

     Certainly the ingenunity of such a man might have devised some means of
putting such an end to his life, that, in the perishable fragments of his 
body
there should linger not one spark of that vitality which had been so often
again and again fanned into existence.

     Probably some effort of that kind may yet be his end, and we shall see
that Varney the Vampyre will not, like the common run of the world's
inhabitants, be changed into that dust of which is all humanity, but will
undergo some violent disruption, and be for ever blotted out from the
muster-roll of the living creatures that inhabit the great world.

     But to cease speculating on such things, and to come to actual facts, 
we
will now turn over another leaf in the strange eventful history of Varney 
the
Vampyre.

          *             *             *             *             *

     One stormy, inclement evening in November, a travelling carriage,
draggled with mud, and dripping with moisture, was driven up to the door of
the London Hotel, which was an establishment not of the very first fashion,
but of great respectability, situated then in Burlington-street, close to 
Old
Bond-street, then the parade of fashion, and, as some thought, elegance;
although we of the present day would look with risibility upon the costumes
that were the vogue, although the period were but fifty years ago; but fifty
years effect strange mutations and revolutions in dress, manners, and even 
in
modes of thought.

     The equipage, if not of the most dashing character, was still of
sufficiently aristocratic pretensions to produce a considerable bustle in 
the
hotel; and the landlord, after seeing  that there was a coronet upon of the
panels of the carriage door, thought it worth his while personally to 
welcome
the guests who had done him the honour of selecting his house.

     These guests consisted of an oldish man and woman, a young man of
frivolous and foppish exterior, of about twenty-two years of age, and a 
young
lady, who was so covered up in a multitude of shawls, that but little of her
face could be seen; but that little was sufficient to stamp her at once as
most beautiful.

     The whole party evidently paid great court to this young lady, but
whether they did so from affection, or from some more interested motive, it
would not be proper just now to say, as those facts will come out before we
have proceeded far in this little episode.

     "Mind how you step, Annette," said the old gentleman, as the young lady
descended the carriage.  "Mind how you step, my dear."

     "Oh! yes, yes," said the old lady, who was not so very old either,
although entering upon the shady side of fifty.  "Yes.  Oh! mind my dear, 
how
you get out."

     The young lady made no reply to all these kind injunctions, but pushing
aside the proffered arm of the younger gentleman, she tripped into the hotel
unaided.

     The old lady instantly followed her.

     "Now, Francis," said the old gentleman to the servant, who got down 
from
the rumble of the travelling carriage.  "Now, Francis, you perfectly
recollect, I hope, what my brother, Lord Lake, said to you?"

     "Yes, sir," said Francis, but there was not the most respectful
intonation in the world in the voice with which he returned the affirmative.

     "You remember," continued the old gentleman; "you remember, Francis, 
that
my brother told you, you were to wait upon us just the same as upon himself,
with the carriage."

     "Oh, yes."

     "Oh, yes! what do you mean by saying 'oh, yes!' to me?"

     "Do you want me to say, 'oh, no?'"

     "Francis, this won't do.  You are discharged."

     "That for you, and the discharge, too," said Francis, as he snapped his
fingers in the face of the old gentleman.  "I never meant to serve you, 
Mister
Lake; I'm Lord Lake's groom, but I ain't a going to be turned over to a
canting fellow like you, so you have only took the words out of my mouth, 
for
I meant to discharge myself, and so will George.  I say, George."

     "Yes," replied the coachman; "what is it?"

     "Are we going to be at the beck and call of Jonathan Lake?"

     "See him d--d first," was the laconic reply of the coachman.

     "Now, Mister Lake, added Francis, "you knows what we thinks of you.  
You
is a humbug.  We only came so far, because we wouldn't put Miss Annette, our
young lady, to the inconvenience of a post-chaise, while my lord, her 
father's
carriage here, was so much more comfortable.  We shall take that to the
coachmaker's, where my lord's other carriages are standing, till he comes to
England, and then you won't see us no more."

     "You rascals!"

     "Oh, go on.  You're a humbug; ain't he, George?"

     "Oh, a _riglar_ one-- a _numbug_ he is," aid the coachman; "and what's
more, we don't believe a word of all what's been a going on.  Lady Annette 
is
Lady Annette, bless her sweet eyes.  Come on, Francis, I'm wet."

     "And I'm damp," said Francis, as he shook himself, and made as much
splashing round him as a great Newfoundland dog, who has just had a bath.
"I'm ready now, mister, and you knows our minds, and we ain't the sort of
folks to alter'em.  We serves our master; but we doesn't serve a humbug."

     Some of the waiters at the hotel had come to the door to hear this 
rather
curious colloquy, and not a little surprised were they at it.  At all 
events,
whatever other effect it had upon them, it did not increase their respect 
for
the new arrivals, and one of them, named Slop, ran after the carriage, and
called out to Francis, --

     "I say-- I say!"

     "Well, what?"

     "I say, young fellow, just tell me where you will be staying, and I'll
come and see you, and stand a glass."

     Francis leant over the roof of the carriage, and said, --

     "George-- George!"

     "Here ye _air_," said George.

     "Here's one o' the waiters at the hotel wants to make an acquaintance.
It won't be a bad thing to know him, as you see he can tell us all about 
Lady
Annette, and what the ladies are doing.  What do you say to it, George?"

     "A good idea, Francis."

     "Very well.  Hilloa! what's your name, old fellow?"

     "Slop-- Solomon Slop, they calls me."

     "Well, if you come any evening to the King's Head, in Welbeck-street,
you'll find either me or George; and we always likes good company, and shall
be very glad to see you whenever you like.  Supppose you say to-morrow?"

     "I will, -- I will; to-morrow I can come easily at eight o'clock, so 
you
may expect me.  Good night."

     "Good night, Slop.  Pleasant evening, ain't it?  Drive on, George; I
shall be in a ague presently; drive on, good luck to you, and let's get a
change of things, whatever you do I never was so wet, I do think, in all my
life."

     "Nor me, nor me," said George, who it will be perceived was not very
particular about his grammar; but that didn't matter much.  He was paid for 
a
knowledge of horses, not of moods, tenses, and cases.

     Leaving the servants, then, of Lord Lake, as they had announced
themselves to be, let us return to the hotel, where the family party had by
this time got into comfortable enough quarters.

     As far as the landlord of that establishment was concerned, Mr. Lake 
had
won him over completely, by ordering the best rooms, a supper, as good as 
the
house could afford, regardless of the price; the best wines, and altogether
showed a right royal disposition as regarded expenditure.

     But the waiters, who had often found by experience that the most
extravagant people were not the most liberal to them, did not forget what 
had
passed at the door, and many a whispered surmise passed from one to the 
other
regarding the circumstances that had induced the coachman and groom to treat
the family so very cavalierly, and so obstinately to decline serving them.

     When Slop returned, he got some of his companions round him in the 
hall.

     "I shall know all about it," he said; "I'm to go and take a glass with
them to-morrow night, at the King's Head, in Welbeck-street, and you see if
they don't tell me what it's all about.  I wouldn't miss knowing for a
trifle."

     "Nor me-- nor me."

     "Well, I'll of course tell you all when I come back.  You may depend 
upon
it it's something worth knowing.  Have you seen the young lady any of you.  
I
caught just a look of one eye, and the end of her nose, and I should say 
she's
a out-and-outer, and no mistake."

 Next Time: The Second Arrival at the London Hotel. -- The Mysterious Guest.




                             CHAPTER CLXII [sic]

                               [Chapter 180]

THE SECOND ARRIVAL AT THE LONDON HOTEL. -- THE MYSTERIOUS GUEST.


     Scarcely had the bustle of the arrival we have noticed subsided at the
London Hotel, when another travelling chariot dashed up to the door, and the
landlord made a rush out to welcome his new arrival, considering himself 
quite
in luck to have two such customers in one evening.

     A gentleman, on whose head was a fur travelling cap, was at one of the
windows of this carriage, and he called to the landlord, saying, --

     "Are your best rooms occupied?"

     "Not the best, sir," was the reply, "for we have several suites of
apartments in all respects equal to each other; but we have a family just
arrived in one suite.  The Lake family, sir."

     "Well, it don't matter to me who you have; I will get out if you can
accomodate me."

     "Oh, certainly, sir; you will find here accomodation of the very first
character, I can assure you, sir.  Pray, sir, alight.  Allow me, sir, to 
hold
an umbrella over you.  It's a bad night, sir; I'm afraid the winter is 
setting
in very strangely, sir, and prophetically of----"

     "Silence.  I don't want your opinion of the matter.  If there's one 
thing
I dislike more than another, it's a chattering man."

     This rebuff silenced the landlord, who said not another word, although
probably he thought the more; and those thoughts were not of a very kindly
character as regarded the stranger, who had so very unceremoniously stopped
his amiable remarks.

     Indeed, when he got into the hall, he consigned the new comer to the 
care
of the head waiter, and retired to his own apartment in great dudgeon.

     "I hope everything is quiet here," said the stranger to the head 
waiter.

     "Oh, dear, yes, sir; the house is as quiet as a lamb, sir, I can assure
you.  We have only three inmates at present, sir.  There's the Lakes, --
hightly respectable people, sir.  A brother of Lord Lakes, sir, I believe, 
and
the----"

     "I don't want to hear who you have.  What the devil is it to me?  If
there's anything I dislike more than another, it's a  d--d magpie of a
waiter."

     The head waiter was terribly offended, and said not another word, so 
that
the gentleman was left in the sole occupation of his apartments, and then to
fling himself upon a couch.

     "Ah, ah!  God knows how it will all end.  Well, well, we shall see, we
shall see.  They have arrived, and that's one comfort; I am now, then, I 
think
so well made up, that they will not readily know me.  Oh, no, no, I should
hardly know myself, now, shaven clean as I am, after being accustomed on the
continent, to wear beard and moustache.  Well, well, we shall see, how it 
will
all end.  Thank the fates, they have not gone somewhere where I could not 
find
them."  He rung the bell.

     "Waiter, let me have the best the house affords, will you? and remember
my name is Blue."

     "Sir!  Bl-- Blue, sir?"

     "Yes, Diggory Blue."

     "Yes, sir, -- yes sir.  Certainly.  What an odd name," soliloquised the
waiter, as he went down stairs to tell his master.  "I say sir, the gent in
No. 10 and 11 says his name is Diggory Blue."

     "Blue, Blue." said the landlord, "it is an odd name for a Christian."

     "Perhaps he ain't a Christian," said the very identical Mr. Blue 
himself,
popping his head over the bar in which the little discourse was going on,
between the landlord and the waiter.  "How do you know he's a Christian?"

     "I beg your pardon, sir, really I-- I-- a-hem! a thousand pardons sir."

     "Pshaw!"

     The strange gentleman went to the door, and gave some directions to the
servants belonging to his carriage, which sent them away, and then Mr. Blue
started up into his rooms again, without saying another word to the 
landlord, 
who was terribly annoyed at being caught canvassing the name of one of his
guests, with one of his waiters.

     "Confound him," he muttered, "he has no business to have such a name as
Blue and good God! if his sirname was Blue, what the devil made his 
godfathers
and godmothers call him Diggory?  Sam, Sam!"

     "Yes, sir."

     "Put down in the book, Diggory Blue."

     "Yes, sir."

     "Bless us! why there's somebody else as I'm a sinner."  The landlord
could not have sworn by a better oath.

     He ran to the door, and there beheld another travelling carriage, out 
of
which stepped a gentlemanly looking man enveloped in a rich travelling cloak
lined with fur.

     "Can you accommodate us?" he said.

     "Yes, sir, with pleasure."

     "Who have you here, landlord?"

     "A family named Lake, sir, and a Mr. -- a-- Blue, sir."

     "Quiet people I dare say, I shall most likely remain with you a week or
two.  Let me have the best apartments you have unoccupied at present."

     "Yes, sir.  This way if you please, sir-- this way."

     The last arrival seemed to be in bad health, for he walked very slowly,
like a man suffering from great bodily exhaustion, and more than once he
paused as he followed the landlord up the principal staircase of the hotel, 
as
if it were absolutely necessary he should do so to recover breath, and
moreover the landlord heard him sigh deeply, but whether that was from 
mental
or physical distress he had no means of knowing.  His curiosity, however, 
was
much excited by the gentleman, and his sympathies likewise, for he was the
reverse of Mr. Blue, and listened with a refined and gentlemanly courtesy to
whatever was said to him by any one apparently, although it was evidently an
effort to speak, so weak and ill did he seem to be." [sic]

     "I am sorry, sir," said the landlord, when he had shewn the gentleman
into his rooms, "I am sorry sir, you don't seem well."

     "I am rather an invalid, but I dare say I shall soon be better, thank
you-- thank you.  One candle only, I dislike too much light: charge for as
many as you please, but never let me have but one, landlord."

     "As you please, sir, as you please; I hope you will make yourself
comfortable here, and I can assure you, sir, that nothing shall be wanting 
on
my part to make you so."

     "I am sure of that, landlord; you are very good, thank you."

     "What name shall I say, sir, in case any gentleman should call to see
you, sir?"

     "Black."

     "Black, sir!" -- "Black." -- "Oh, Mr. Black! -- Yes, sir, certainly, 
why
not?  Oh, of course.  I-- only thought it a little odd, you see, sir, 
because
we have a gentleman already in the house called Blue.  That was all, sir.  
Mr.
Black, thank you, sir."

     The landlord bowed himself out, and Mr. Black inclined his head with 
the
look of a condescending emperor, so that when the landlord got down stairs, 
he
said to his wife, --

     "Now that _is_ a gentleman.  he listens to all you have got to say, 
like
a gentleman, and don't snap you up as that Mr. Blue did.  Mr. Black, it is
quite clear to me, is a man of the world, and a perfect gentleman.  Hilloa,
what's that?  Eh?  What! why it's Mr. Black's bell, and he must have almost
broken the wire.  Sam, Sam! run up to 8, and see what's wanted."

     Sam did run up to 8, and when he got there, he found Mr. Black lying 
upon
the floor in a fainting fit, and wholly insensible.

     The alarmed waiter ran down stairs to his master with the news, and the
nearest medical man was sent for, but with as little parade as possible, for
the hotel-keeper did not wish to alarm all his other guests with the news of
the fact that there was a sick person in the house, which he knew was not
plesing to many persons, and might induce them to change their quarters.

     When the medical man came, he was shown up stiars at once, when Mr. 
Black
had been lifted on to a sofa, where he lay without any signs of 
consciousness
at all, much to the horror of the landlord, who began to think he was dead,
and that there would be all the disagreeableness of having a corpse in his
house.

     The surgeon felt the pulse and the heart, and then he said, --

     "He is in a swoon, but he must be in a desperately weak state."

     "He looks it, don't he, sir?"

     "He does indeed.  How dreadfully emaciated he is!"

     By dint of great exertion and the use of stimulants, the surgeon 
succeded
in restoring Mr. Black to consciousness, and when he was so restored, he
looked around him with that strange vacant expression which a man wears who
has newly come out of a trance and whose memory is in a state of abeyance.

     "Well, sir, how are you now?" said the surgeon.

     He made no reply.

     "I should advise that he be put to bed, landlord," added the medical 
man,
"and something of a warm nourishing quality given to him.  I will send him
some medicine."

     Mr. Black now made an effort to speak, and his memory seemed to have 
come
back to him as he said,

     "I fear I have been a deal of trouble, but the fatigue of travelling
fast-- it is that has unnerved me-- I shall be much better to-morrow.  Thank
you all."

     "I will call to-morrow" said the surgeon, "and see how you get on, if 
you
please."

     "I shall be much obliged; I feel myself quite strong enough to retire 
for
the night without assistance, thank you."

     He made no opposition to the landlord sending him up by Sam some spiced
wine, and when it came, he said, --

family sleeps in the next room but one to you, that is to say, No. 9.  The
very next room aint [sic] occupied at all, sir, to night, so you will be as

 Next Time: The Night Alarm -- A Scene of Confusion. -- Mr. Blue Suspected.




                            CHAPTER CLXIII [sic]

                               [Chapter 181]

THE NIGHT ALARM -- A SCENE OF CONFUSION. -- MR. BLUE SUSPECTED.


     It is midnight, and the landlord of the hotel suddenly springs out of 
bed
on to the floor as if he had been galvanised, carrying with him all the 
bed-clothes and leaving his wife shivering.

     "Good gracious! what was that?" he cried.

     And well he might, for the repose of the whole house was broken in upon
by two loud shrieks, such as had never before sounded within those walls, 
and
then all was still as the grave.

     "Murder! murder!" shouted the landlady, "somebody has stolen all the 
bed-clothes."

     "Bother the bed-clothes" cried the landlord, as he hurried on his 
apparel
by the dim light of a night lamp that was burning on the dressing table.
"There's something wrong in the house, or else I have had one of the 
strangest
dreams that ever anybody had, and one of the most likely reality too.  Did 
you
hear them?"

     "Oh, those horrid screams!"

     "It's not a dream then, for two people don't dream the same thing at 
the
same moment of time that's quite clear.  Hark-- hark! what's that, what a
banging of doors to be sure.  Who's there?  Who's there?  Wait a bit."

     The landlord lifted the night bolt of his bed room, and then there 
dashed
into the room in only one garment, which fluttered in the breeze, no other
than the young man who had come with the ladies.  He made but one spring 
into
the landlord's bed, crying, --

     "Oh! take care of me.  Oh, save me!  There's thieves or something and I
shall be hurt.  Oh, save me, save me, I can't fight, I never did, spare my
life, oh, spare my life."

     "Oh, the wretch!" shrieked the landlady, and the landlord, justly 
enough
enraged at that intrusion, seized upon the intruder and shot him out of the
room _vi et armis_, and that with such force too that he rolled all the way
down the stairs, upsetting Sam who was rushing up with a lantern, it having
been his turn to sit up all night, as one of the establishment always did, 
in
case of fire or anything happening which might make it necessary to arouse 
the
inmates of the house.

     The landlord, however, had completed enough of his toilette to enable 
him
to make a decent appearance; so out he sallied, having lit a candle, and the
first person he met upon the landing was Mr. Blue, fully dressed and with a
pistol in his hand.

     "Good God, sir," cried the landlord, "what is it all about, what has
happened sir?"

     "I cannot tell you, and am as anxious as you can be to know.  This way,
this way.  It was the young lady who screamed.  For God's sake, lend me a
light!"

     The landlord resigned his light mechanically, and he saw to his 
surprise,
that there was a black patch now over one of Mr. Blue's eyes, and he thought
his face was painted.  At all events, he was so much disguised that it was
only by his voice that the landlord knew him.

     Before however, they either of them got across the corridor to the door
of the young lady's room, Mr. and Mrs. Lake half-dressed, made their
appearance, both eagerly inquiring what was the matter.

     "I don't know," said the landlord, "I only heard a scream."

     "Which came from the apartment of that young lady," said Mr. Blue.

     "What young lady?" said Mr. Lake sharply.  "It's rather odd that you, a
stranger, should know so precisely which was the apartment of that young 
lady.
Mrs. Lake go in and see if anything be the matter with Annetta; I hope to
Heaven, nothing is amiss with her."

     Mr. Lake looked suspiciously at Mr. Blue, and so did the landlord, for
when Mr. Blue had spoken in the presence of the Lakes, his voice was
completely altered, so that the landlord no longer could have recognized him
by it, and he was more puzzled than ever.

     "Oh! come in, come in, Mr. Lake," cried Mrs. Lake, appearing at the 
door
of Annetta's room, "she is dead."

     "Dead!" cried Mr. Blue with a shout, "Oh! no, no, no!"

     He dashed past Mr. Lake, the landlord, and Mrs. Lake, and was in the 
room
in a moment.  They went after him as soon as they had recovered sufficiently
from their surprise to do so, and they saw him with his hands clasped, and
bending over the form of the beautiful young girl as she lay in bed.

     "No, no, no," he said, "she is not dead.  She has fainted.  God knows
what the cause may be, but she is not dead.  Thank Heaven!"

     He turned from the bedside, and without saying another word to the
parties present, he walked away to his own room, and left them staring at 
each
other in surprise.  The young lady now opened her eyes, and looked wildly
about her for a few moments, and then she spoke quickly,

     "Oh, help! help! help! away, away.  Oh, horror-- horror-- horror!"

     "Annetta, my dear Annetta," said Mrs. Lake, "what is this?  Pray, sir,
retire," to the landlord.  "My dear Annetta, what has alarmed you?  My dear,
go away, Mr. Lake.  I will let you know all about it.  It's a mystery to me 
at
present.  Go away, I'll be back soon."

     Mr. Lake left the room, and in the corridor he found the landlord, who
was looking as bewildered as any mortal man could well look, for he could 
make
neither head nor tail of the whole affair.

     "Landlord," said Mr. Lake, "who is that party who behaved so strangely
just now[?"]

     "His name is Blue, sir."

     "Blue-- Blue.  An odd name, and an odd man.  Where can I have seen him
before.  Just as he cried out, and went into the room, I thought there was a
something in his voice that came familiarily to my ears, and yet I don't 
know
him; I suspect landlord, that he has had more to do with this midnight
disturbance than he would care to own."

     "Well, sir, I don't know," said the landlord, whose interest it was not
to disoblige, or throw suspicion upon any of his guests.  "It really ain't
very likely, sir.  I should say the young lady has had a bad dream, sir, and
that's almost all that can be said about it."

     "It may be so."

     "You may depend that's what it will turn out to be, sir."

     "I hope so, I hope so.  These things are not at all pleasant, and if
anything of the kind should happen again we should have to quit directly, 
you
know, but I can say nothing now about it until I have heard from Mrs. Lake
what account Annetta gives of the affair.  That alone must guide us in the
whole business.  In the morning we will talk about it, sir."

     There was a great deal of austerity in the manner of Mr. Lake; indeed 
he
might well enough be excused for not being over pleased at what had taken
place, and as for Mr. Blue there certainly was sufficient in his behaviour 
to
induce a large amount of suspicion, that he was in some way connected with 
the
affair.  Moreover the efforts he evidently made in the way of disguise were
extremely suspicious in themselves.  He evidently had a something to 
conceal,
and when the landlord was now left alone in the corridor, he was strongly
induced to make one of his first acts in the morning a notice to Mr. Blue,
that he would much prefer his room to his company at the London Hotel.

     And then it all of a sudden came into the landlord's head, how poor Mr.
Black must have beeen [sic] distressed at what had taken place; for Sam had
told him what Mr. Black had said about wishing to sleep quietly, so that he
felt quite a pang at the idea of so civil a gentleman having been so awfully
disturbed, as he must have been, and he had no doubt but that in the morning
he would go away.

     "I wonder if he is awake?" thought the landlord; "if I could but make
some sort of apology to him to-night, and soothe him, all might be well.  
I'll
first go and listen at his door; it may be that he really wants something, 
and
if so perhaps it would look attentive to knock and see him; I think I will.
It's quite out of the question that he should have slept in the middle of 
all
this riot."

     He approached Mr. Black's door, and listened[.]

     All was still as the very grave.

     "What a horrid thing it would be if the shock, in his weak state, has
been the death of him!" thought the landlord, and the very idea made him 
quake
again.

     After a few moments passed in this state of painful thought, he found
that it would be quite out of the question for him to go to his own room
again, without ascertaining how Mr. Black was, and accordingly he knocked at
the door, first gently and then louder, and then louder still, but received 
no
answer.

     "Oh, this won't do, I must get in somehow," thought the landlord.

     He tried the handle, and found in a moment that the door was not fast; 
a
light was burning on the side of the table which was close to the bed, and
there lay Mr. Black fast asleep, and looking so calm and serene, although he
was an ugly man, that the landlord was truly astonished to see him.

     "Well," he said, "that's what I call sound sleeping, at all events.  
It's
a mercy however."  Oh lor! he' going to awake."

     Mr. Black opened his eyes, and looked up.

     "I beg your pardon, sir," said the landlord, "I earnestly beg your
pardon, but as there had been a litle [sic] noise in the house I came to 
see,
first, if you had been disturbed, an then if you wanted anything, sir."

     "No, no, thank you.  Has there been a noise, do you say."

     "A-- a little, sir."

     "Well, I was fast asleep and did not hear it.  However, I do sleep so
sound that I think a cannon going off at my ear would hardly awaken me.  I 
am
much obliged however for your attention, landlord."

     "Can't I get you anything, sir?"

     "Nothing until the morning, thank you."

     "Thank you sir, good night sir, good night." -- "Well," said the
landlord, as, finding all quiet, he took his way now back to his own room,
"well, he is a gentleman, every inch of him, that he is.  How very mild and
polite. -- He hasn'nt [sic] been disturbed, well that's a comfort."

 Next Time: The Waiter Tells the Story of the Lakes' Disturbance to George
 and Francis.




                             CHAPTER CLXIV [sic]

                               [Chapter 182]

THE WAITER TELLS THE STORY OF THE LAKES' DISTURBANCE TO GEORGE  AND FRANCIS.


     Nothing further occurred during the night to cause any alarm to the
inmates of the London Hotel, but we may as well give Miss Annetta'a account
of the night's transaction; and account which she gave to Mrs. Lake at the 
time, and which soon spread all over the hotel, with, no doubt, many 
additions
and embellishments as it was carried.

     She said, that having retired to rest, she, being fatigued by her
journey, soon dropped off asleep.  That she, to the best of her belief,
fastened her room door, although she certainly could not absolutely swear to
having done so, she was so very weary.  She did not know how long she had
slept, but she had a frightful dream, in which she thought she was pursued 
by
wolves who ran after her through a large tract of country until she took
shelter in a wood, and then all the wolves left her and abandoned the 
pursuit,
except one, and that one caught her and fastened his fangs in her throat 
just
as she sunk down exhausted upon a great heap of dried leaves that came in 
her
way in the forest.

     She then went on to say that in the agony of her dream she actually 
awoke
at that moment, and saw a human face close to her, and that _a man had his
mouth close to her neck, and was sucking her blood_.

     It was then that she uttered the two screams which had so alarmed the
whole house; and then she stated that the vampire, for such she named the
apparition, left her and she fainted away.

     Now this story so far as it went, might all be very well accounted for 
by
being called a dream, and the change from a wolf to a man might be but one 
of
those fantastic changes that our sleeping visions so frequently undergo, but 
--
and in this case this was a serious but -- but _she showed upon her neck the
marks of two teeth_, and there was a small wound on which even in the 
morning
was a little portion of coagulated blood.

     This staggered everybody, as well it might, and the whole hotel was in 
a
state of confusion.  Mr. Blue kept his room.  Mr. Black got up and declared
that he was much better than the day before, attributing his indisposition 
to
bodily fatigue; and the Lakes were in a state of consternation difficult to
describe.

     The landlord, too, was nearly out of  his senses at the idea of a 
vampire
being in  his house, adn a grand consultation was held in the bar parlour
between him, Mr. and Mrs. Lake, and Mr. Black, who was asked if he would 
step
down and give his opinion, which compliment was paid to him on account of 
his
being such a gentlemanly and quiet man.

     They took it in turns to speak, and the landlord had the first say.

     "Gentlemen," he said, "and you madam, you can easily conceive how 
grieved
I am about what has taken place, and I can only say that anything in the 
world
that I can do to find out all about it, I will do with the greatest possible
pleasure.  Command me in any way, but-- but if I have a suspicion of anybody
in this house, it is of that Mr. Blue."

     "And I too," said Mrs. Lake.

     "I don't know what to say further," remarked Mr. Lake, "than that my
suspicions of some foul play on the part of Mr. Blue, are so strong, that if
he is not turned out of the Hotel, we will leave to-night."

     "That's conclusive," said the landlord.  "But if you  Mr. Black, would
favor us with your opinion, I'm sure, sir, we should be all much obliged."

     "I am afraid," said Mr. Black in his quiet, gentlemanly way, "that my
opinion will be of very little importance, as I know nothing of the whole
affair, but just what I have heard from one and another; I slept all the 
while
it appears.  But there is one circumstance that certainly to me is an
unpleasant and a suspicious one, and that is that Mr. Blue, as he calls
himself, was up and dressed, and that, with the exception of your
night-watchman, he was the only person in the hotel who was so."

     "That's a fact," said the landlord, "I met him."

     "Then that settles the business," said Mr. Lake, "send him away.  God
knows if there be such things as vampires or not, but al all events, the
suspicion is horrid, so you had better get rid of him at once."

     "I will-- I will."

     "Stop," said Mr. Black.  "Before you do so, is it not worth while to 
make
some effort to come at the precise truth, and that in my opinion, would be
very desirable indeed."

     "It would-- it wold," said Mr. Lake, "you must understand, sir, that 
the
young lady is especially under my care, and in fact I esteem her greatly--
very greatly I may say, for a variety of reasons, and therefore anything 
that
I can do, which may have the effect of securing her peace of mind and
happiness will be to me a sacred purpose."

     "Then I should recommend," said Mr. Black, "that this lady and your 
wife,
landlord, keep watch in the young lady's chamber to-night."

     "Oh, I couldn't-- I couldn't," said the landlady.

     "Nor I," replied Mrs. Lake, "nor I, I'm sure, I cannot think of such a
thing, I could not do it, I should faint away from terror.

     "And so should I," cried the landlady.  "I feel quite ill even now at 
the
thought of the thing."

     "Then I can say no more, ladies.  Of course, gentlemen cannot very 
well,
unless they are very near relatives, undertake such a job.  I tell you what 
we
can do, though; suppose we watch in the corridor, you and I, Mr. Lake, and
leaving the door of the young lady's chamber just closed we shall hear if
there be any alarm given from within and effectually secure her from 
intrusion
without.  What say you to this, as a plan of proceedings?  There is your son
too, might keep watch with us."

     "I'm afraid he is too nervous."

     "Yes," said the landlord, "and he might pop into my bed again, as he 
did
last night in his fright.  Oh don't have him gentlemen, I beg of you.  I 
would
go myself, but I am so sleepy always, that I never can keep my eyes open 
after
twelve o'clock.  Not that I am at all afraid of anything, but its downright
sleepiness you see, gentlemen.  I am on my feet all day, and-- and so you 
see
I'd rather not on the whole."

     "I am willing," said Mr. Black.

     "Sir," said Mr. Lake, "I am quite ashamed of giving you so much 
trouble,
but I can only say that I shall be very much obliged indeed, by your 
company,
and I do hope that we shall have the pleasure of catching Mr. Blue if he be
guilty."

     "Or acquitting him if innocent," added Mr. Black.  "Let us be just even
in the midst of our suspicions.  It would be a terrible thing to stigmatise
this gentleman as a vampire, when perhaps he may have as great a horror of
such gentry as we possibly can."

     At this moment young Lake made his appearance.  He looked rather pale 
as
he apologised to the landlord for his unintentional intrusion into his room
over night.

     "The fact is," said he, "I am as constitutionally brave as a lion, and 
so
whenever anything occurs I run away."

     "Indeed, sir, an odd way of showing courage," said Mr. Black.  "Why do
you run away?"

     "For fear, sir, of doing something rash."

     "Well, I certainly never heard a better excuse for an undignified 
retreat
in one's shirt, before in my life.  But you will not be called upon to do
anything to-night.  You had better shut yourself up, and let you hear what 
you
will, you need not come out of your room, you know."

     "Well, do you know, sir, I think that it would be the best way, for if 
I
came out I might do something rash, such as kill somebody, which I should
afterwards be sorry for, you know."

     "Certainly."

     "Then that's understood, father, that let what will happen I won't come
out.  I have been speaking to Annetta, but I can't somehow or another get 
her
to be pleasant."

     "Hush!" said old Lake, and he bent his brows upon his son reprovingly,
as if he fancied that he was letting out more of the family secrets than he
ought to have done.  The young man was silent accordingly, for he seemed to 
be
in great dread of his father, who certainly if not a better man, was a man 
of
much more intellect and courage than the son, who was but a very few degrees
removed from absolute silliness.  He was fool enough to be wicked, and the
father was cunning enough to be so.  How strange that vice should usually
belong to the two extremes of intellect, that folly and talent should lead 
to
similar results, a disregard of the ordinary moral obligations; but it is 
so.

    We may pass over the rest of the day, and we do so the more willingly,
because we are anxious that the reader should be possessed of some 
particulars
which George and Francis, the servants of Lord Lake communicated without any
reserve at all to Slop, the waiter.

     Indeed, far from having anything like a wish to conceal anything, they
seemed to glory in saying as much as they could with respect to those 
matters
that were uppermost in their mind.

     This was just the frame of mind that Slop would have wished in his
prayers, had he prayed at all upon the subject, to find them in; for 
although
Slop was quite remarkable for neglecting his own affairs, he never neglected
anbody [sic] else's and curiosity had been the bane of his existence.

     Upon arriving at the King's Head, in Chiswell-street, he found that the
servants of Lord Lake were there, according as they had said they should be,
and glasses of something uncommonly hot and strong having been ordered, they
and Slop soon grew quite happy and familiar together.

     First, though, before they would commence a history of anything they 
had
to tell of the Lake family, they resolved upon hearing form Slop all that 
had
passed at the London Hotel, and you may be quite sure, that it lost nothing 
in
the telling, but was duly made as much of as the circumstances would permit.
No doubt the fumes of the something hot materially astisted [sic] Mr. Slop's
invention and general talents upn the interesting occasion.

                               [Chapter 183]


THE COMMUNICATION OF THE SERVANTS RESPECTING THE LAKE FAMILY. 


     The coachman and groom, evidently listened with great interest to what
Slop had to relate.  For a wonder, they were completely silent while he 
spoke;
and when he had concluded, they looked at each other, and nodded, as much to
say, -- Ah! we can draw some conclusion from all that, that you Mr. Slop,
really know nothing at all about.

     "Is that all?" said George.

     "Yes," said the waiter, "and sufficient I think."

     "More, a good deal," remarked Francis.  "But howsomdever, as you seem a
proper sort of fellow, we don't mind telling you what we think of the 
matter."

     "No, no," interposed George, "not exactly that."

     "And why not?"

     "Because you see, Francis, we have never known yet, my boy, what to 
think
about it."

     "Well there's some truth in that at all events.  But we will tell Mr.
Slop what happened once before that wasn't much unlike what has taken place 
at
the London Hotel."

     "Well, but tell him first who she is," said George.  "Then he'll
understand all the rest better, as well as taking more interest in it."

     "Very good.  Then listen, Mr. Slop."

     "With all my ears," said Slop.

     At this moment a bell rung sharply, and Slop on the impulse of the
moment, sprung up, --

     "Coming-- coming-- coming."

     Both George and Francis burst into a great laugh, and Slop was quite
disconcerted.

     "Really, gentlemen," he said, "I'm sorry, very sorry, but I'm so used 
to
cry, coming, when a bell rings, that, for the moment, I forgot there was no
sort of occasion to do so here.  I begs you won't think no more of it, but
tell me all as you have got to tell."

     "Don't mention it," said Francis, and then after taking another draught
of the something strong, and settling himself in his seat, commenced.

     "Lord Lake, you know, is our master, and a very good sort of a man he 
is,
only he's a-- a-- a; what did the doctor call him George?"

     "Oh, I know, a-- a-- a, what was it Frank?"

     "Well, I asked you.  It was a _wallytoddyhairyhun_, I think."

     "Something like it.  Odd wasn't it?"

     "Wery."

     "I beg your pardon, gentlemen," said a gentlemanly looking man who was
seated in an obscure corner of the room, and who was desperately ugly-- at
least so much as could be seen of his face, for it was much muffled up.  "I
beg your pardon, but the word you mean I suppose is valetudinarian."

     "That's it, that's it!  I knows it when I hears it.  That's it; well 
they
say that in consequence of being that ere he was rather cross-grained a 
little
when there wasn't no sort of occasion for it, and barring that, which, poor
man, I suppose he could not help, he was about as decent a master as ever
stepped in shoe leather, wasn't he, George?"

     "I believe you, my boy."

     "Well, the Countess of Bhackbighte was his mother-in-law, you see, a
wicious old woman as ever lived, and when Lady Lake died it was she as 
brought
the news to Lord Lake that his wife was dead, and the wirtuous baby as she 
had
just brought into the world was dead too, was'nt [sic] that it, George?"

     "I believe you my boy, rather."

     "Well, Lord Lake was _inconsolotable_ as they says, for ever so long, 
and
he made friends with his brother who would come next into the property; they
all went abroad together."

     "All who?" said Slop.

     "Wery good, I'll tell you, Lord Lake, his brother, his brother's wife 
and
son.  Them as is now at the London Hotel.  Now you knows, don't you?"

     "Go on, I knows."

     "Well they hadn't been there above a matter o' fourteen years when the
old Countess of Bhackbighte dies, and then there comes a letter to my lord 
as
says that the precious baby as his wife had brought into the world just 
afore
she went out of it herself, wasn't dead at all, but had been smugged [sic]
away by the old Countess, nobody knows what for, and that she was alive and
kicking then, and ready to come to her papa whenever he said the word, and 
so
come she did, you see, and thats [sic] our young lady Annetta, you see,
[sic upsidedown word] as is at the London Hotel."

     "Well, but I don't understand," said Slop.

     "Of course you don't"

     "Oh."

     "But you will if you goes on a listening; you can't expect to undertand
all at once you know.  Just attend to the remainder and you'll soon know all
about it; but George is the man to tell you, that he is."

     "Oh, no, no," said George.

     "Why, you heard it, and told it to me.  Come, don't be foolish, but 
tell
it at once, old fellow."

     "Well, if I must, I must," said George, "so here goes; though when I 
has
to tell anything, I always feels as if I was being _druv_ with a curb
half-a-dozen links too tight.  But here goes."

     "I am very much amused," said Slop, "and should certainly like to hear 
it
all.  Pray go on?"

     "Well, you must know we was at an old tumble down place in Italy, as 
they
call's Rome.  Horridly out o' repair, but that's neither here nor there.  In
course we had stables and riding out; and there was a nice sort o' terrace
where Lord Lake used to walk sometimes, as well as his brother, while the
carriage was being got out, so that I could hear what they said if I chose 
to
do so.

     "Well, one day the brother, Mr. Lake, or the Honourable Dick Lake as he
was sometimes called, was walking there alone, and I seed as he was all of a
tremble like, you understand! but I could not have any idea of what it was
about.  Once or twice I heard him say, -- 'It will do-- and it will do'"

     "Presently, then out comes Lord Lake, and he says, giving the other a
letter, 'Good God, read that!' Give us a trifle more sugar?"

     "What?"

     "Why, what do you mean," said Francis.  "Is that the way to tell a 
story,
to run into what people says what you happens to want yourself?  Here's the
sugar, and now go on."

     "Well, the brother reads it, and then he says; 'Gracious Providence,'
says he 'this here says as the Lady Annetta, aint your daughter, but a
_himposter_.'

     "'Yes,' says Lord Lake, 'oh, what will become of me now?'

     "'Calm yourself,' says the brother, 'and leave this affair to me.  Let
her go with me to England, and we will clear up the mystery.  I love her as 
I
would a child of my own; but still this here letter' says he, 'seems to
contain such a statement;' says he ----"

     "Well?  Well?"

     "That's all!  After that, they walked off the terrace and I didn't hear
no more at all.  After that, in a day or two Lord Lakes comes to me; and 
says,
'George, my brother and his family, with Lady Annetta, are going to England.
I wish you and Francis to accompany them and to attend upon them, just the
same as you would on myself,' says he, and in course I didn't like to say
anything; so we came, but as our idea of the brother is that he's a humbug, 
we
wouldn't have no more to do with him, after we got to London, you see; and 
so
off we went as you heard."

     "Well, but," said Slop; "there was a something else you was to tell 
me;"

     "So there was," said Francis "and this was it.  While we were staying 
at
a place called Florence, and sleeping all of us in an old palace, there was 
an
alarm in the middle of the night, and we found it came from the chamber of 
the
Lady Annetta; who said that a man had got in by the window, and she just 
woke
in time to see him; and when she screamed out away he went again, but 
nothing
could be seen of him; the oddest thing was that the window was so high from
the ground, that it seemed to be quite out of the question that he could 
have
got at it without a ladder; yet the deuce of a ladder was there to be seen."

     "And who was it?"

     "Nobody ever knew, but the night after it was said that a vampire had
visited a cottage near at hand, and fastened on the throat of a little girl 
of
about seven, and sucked half the blood out of her, so that she was lying at
the point of death; and the description the child gave of him was so like 
what
the Lady Annetta said of the man that had got in at the window of her 
bedroom,
that my lord got very uneasy about it, and moved away from Florence as quick
as he could, and no wonder, either, you will say."

     "It was odd."

     "It was, and what you have told me of last night, put me in mind of it,
you see."

     "No doubt; Lord, I'm all of a twitter myself."

     "Why, what need you care? those who know about vampires say that there
are two sorts, one sort always attacks its own relations as was, and nobody
else, and the other always selects the most charming young girls, and nobody
else, and if they can't get either, they starve to death, waste away and 
die,
for they take no food or drink of any sort, unless they are downright 
forced."

     "But who told you?"

     "Oh, an old Italian priest, who spoke English."

 Next Time: The Mysterious Stranger. - The Night Watch.




                             CHAPTER CLXVI [sic]

                               [Chapter 184]


THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER. - THE NIGHT WATCH.


     At this moment, the stranger who had put the coachman and groom right
about the word valetudinarian, rose from the seat he had occupied in the
corner of the room, and uttering a deep, hollow groan, walked towards the
door.

     The party looked at him with awe and astonishment.  He was of great
height but frightfully thin, and the slight glance they could get of his 
face,
showed how perfectly ugly he was.  In another moment he had left the place,
and there was a silence of several minutes duration after he had done so, 
but
it was at length broken by the coachman, who said, --

     "I say, Frank, my boy."

     "Here you is," said Francis.

     "Don't you think if you never seed anybody as looked like a vampire
before, you have seed one now."

     "The devil," said Francis, "you don't mean that?"

     "Yes, I do though, and it strikes me wonderful as we have been a 
telling
all we had to tell afore the very indiwidual, of all others, as we ought'nt 
to
a told it to, that's a vampire.  If a _hoss_ is a _hoss_, that's a vampire,
Frank! I knows it-- I feels it."

     Frank looked aghast.

     "Why, why," then he said, "we have just told him where to find the Lady
Lake if he wants her.  Lor-- what-- suppose it's the same one as got in at 
the
window at Florence!  I'll have him, he can't have got far, I should say, by
this time, and hang me if I don't stop him and know what he is, afore he 
goes
any further.  I shan't sleep if I don't."

     Without waiting for any reply, although the coachman, and Mr. Slop both
seemed to be upon the point of saying something, out rushed the valorous
Francis into the street.  But in about three minutes he came back, and sat
down with a disappointed look.

     "He's off," he said.

     "In course," said the coachman, "through the air like a sky rocket, you
might a know'd that; but arter all, Frank, he mayden't be a vampire.  Do
vampires come into public houses, eh?  Answer me that will you; I rather 
think
that's a settler, Frank."

     "Do you" said Frank.  "It might be, old fellow, if you could prove it.
It would be an odd thing for a vampire to come into a public house and 
drink,
but I don't see, if he has anything again by it, anything to prevent him
coming and ordering and paying for something, and then leaving it.  Look
there!"

     Frank pointed to the brimming glass of something which was on the table
just where the mysterious man had sat, and this to the coachman and to Slop
was such proof positive that they both looked at each other with the most
rueful expression of their countenances.

     "I think you are convinced now, you old ump," added Frank.

     "Rather, rather."

     "I'm all over of a cold _inspiration_," said Slop.

     "Well," added Frank, "it's not never of no use, you know, putting
yourself out of the way about it, and that's the fact, and all I've got to 
say
is that I've got nothing to say."

     "Wery good, wery good."

     "But if you, Mr. Slop, will give us a call to-morrow and let us know if
anything wrong has took place at the London Hotel, we shall be very much
obliged to you; for its [sic] natural for us that we feel an interest in
what's going on there on account of our young lady, who we won't and don't
think is anything else but our young lady, and if she was not, she ought to
be; and I tell you what, just keep an eye on the spooney, young Lake."

     "I will."

     "He wants to be be quite sweet with the Lady Annetta, but she can't 
abide
him.  But you tell us if he tries to pitch it too strong, and we shall 
perhaps
hit on some scheme of operations."

     All this Slop promised faithfully, and with his own nerves rather
startled at the idea of having been in the same room for the better part of 
an
hour with a vampire, he walked back to the hotel, and as he had not been
enjoined to any secrecy he gave the landlord a full and particular account 
of
all that had taken place.

     This was listened to with no small degree of interest, but as mine host
of the London Hotel could make nothing of it, he could do nothing with it.

     "Slop," he said, "I don't like the state of things at all, I assure 
you,
Slop, and I rather shake than otherwise about what's to occur to-night.  You
know there's to be a watch kept in the corridor by the young lady's room, or
else poor thing no doubt she wouldn't get a wink of sleep, and I'm quite 
sure
that I sha'nt at all events, let what will happen or what won't; I'm all in 
a
twitter now as it is, I've broke nine wine glasses already; and all I can 
say
is, I wish they would all go away.

     The landlord did not like to give good guests notice to quit his house,
but he had a consultation with Mr. Black, whom he considered to be quite his
sheet-anchor in this affair, for if that gentleman had not offered to sit up
and watch for the vampire, he, the landlord, certainly would, despite all
profitable considerations, have requested guests who brought with them such
questionable connexions to leave.

     The night had now come on, and as hour after hour passed away, the
anxiety of all concerned in the affairs that were taking place at the London
hotel increased.  But we need not occupy the time and attention of the 
reader
with surmises and reflections while facts of an interesting and strange 
nature
remain to be detailed.

     Suffice it that at eleven o'clock the Lady Annetta retired to rest.

     Two chairs, and a table on which burnt two candles, were placed in the
corridor just outside the room in which the fair girl who had the previous
night had such a visitor reposed, and there sat Mr. Black and Mr. Lake, both
determined to do their utmost to discover the mystery of the vampire's
appearance, and to capture him should he again show himself.

     During the first half hour's watch, Mr. Lake related to his companion 
the
particulars of the affair at Florence, which as it has already been told by
Francis, we need not again recapitulate, suffice it to say that the 
narration
was listened to by Mr. Black with great interest.

     "And did you," he said, "make no discovery of who this midnight visitor
was?"

     "None whatever."

     "'Tis awfully strange."

     "It is, and has given her abundance of uneasiness."

     "And well it may, sir, I shall be very happy if through my means any
elucidation of these mysteries and truly terrific visitations should take
place."

     "You are very good sir.  What is that?"

     "Twelve o'clock, I think, striking by some neighbouring church
time-keeper.  Hush! is it not so?  Yes, twelve."

     "It is.  How still the house is.  I was told this was a very quiet 
hotel,
and so indeed I find it, but yet, I suppose upon this occasion there is more
stillness than usual."

     "Doubtless.  Hush, hush! what was that?  I though[t] I heard something
like a window opening slowly and cautiously.  Hark!  There again.  Do you 
not
hear it.  Hush, hush.  Listen now."

     "On my life I can hear nothing."

     "Indeed your sense of hearing then is not so sharp as mine.  Look 
there."

     He pointed as he spoke to the door of Mr. Blue' chamber, which was 
opened
a very short distance, not above a couple of inches, and then he added in a
whisper, "What do you think of that?"

     "By heaven!  I suspected him before."

     "And I-- and-- be still, whatever you do.  But yet perhaps it would be
better.  Go down stairs and bring up the hall porter, we may as well be in
force you know.  The door at the head of the stairs is open.  You can depend
upon my keeping a good watch while you are gone.  Now, now, quick, or we may
be pounced upon and murdered before we are aware."

     Thus urged Mr. Lake ran down stairs for the purpose of rousing up the
night-porter, and he found that that indiviual did indeed require rousing 
up.

     "Hilloa, my man," he said, "get up!"

     "Eh? eh? what? fire!"

     "No, no, they want you up stairs, that's all.  You are a pretty fellow 
to
consider yourself a night-watch here and to be fast asleep.  Why, with the
exception that you have your clothes on you, you are no more ready than
anybody else in the house."

     "I beg your pardon sir, I always sleeps with one eye open."

     "Well well, come up stairs!"

     A loud scream at this moment came upon their ears, and the night-porter
staggered back again into his great leathern chair, from whence he had just
risen, and looked aghast! while Mr. Lake turned pale and trembled fearfully.

     "Good God!" he said, "what's that?"

     A bell was run furiously, and then ceased, with a sudden jar, as if the
wire had broken, which was indeed the fact.  Then Mr. Lake, mustering all 
the
courage he possessed, ran up stairs again, leaving the night-porter to 
follow
him, or not as he felt inclined; but when he reached the door at the top of
the staircase, he found that it was fast, nor could he with all his strength
force it open.

     "Help! help! help!" he heard a voice cry.

 Next Time: The Vampire's Feast. -- The Alarm and the Pursuit.




                             CHAPTER CLXVII [sic]

                               [Chapter 185]


THE VAMPIRE'S FEAST. -- THE ALARM AND THE PURSUIT.


     A general ringing of bells now ensued in the hotel, from all the 
bedrooms
that were occupied, and the din in the house was quite terrific.

     Mr. Lake hammered away at the door leading to the corridor, and he was
soon joined by the hall-porter, who having now recovered from the first 
shock
which the scream had given him, showed more courage and determination than 
any
one would have given him credit for.  He was rather a bulky man, and without
any more ado, he flung himself bodily against the door with such force that 
he
dashed it open and rolled into the corridor.

     All was darkness.

     "Lights! lights! lights!" shouted Mr. Lake.  "Lights! -- Mr. Black, 
where
are you?  Mr. Black!  Mr. Black!

     A door, it was that of Mr. Blue, was now dashed open, and that 
gentleman
appeared with a candle in his hand, and a pistol firmly grasped in the 
other.
It was very strange but he wore an artificial masquerade nose of an enormous
size, and had on a red wig.

     "Who locked my door?" he cried, "who locked my room door on the outside
and forced me to break it open-- who did it?"

     "Where is the vampire?" said Mr. Lake.

     "Lights! lights! Lights!" shouted the night-watchman, and in another
minute the landlord and several waiters, half-dressed but carrying lights, 
and
each armed with the first weapon of offence he could lay his hands on at the
moment, made their appearance on the scene of action.

     "What is it?  What is it?" cried the landlord.  "Oh what is it?"

     "God knows," cried Mr. Lake, and he darted into the apartment of the
young lady.  In another moment he emerged, and tottered towards one of the
seats.

     "She is covered with blood," he said.

     Mr. Blue and the landlady of the Hotel both made a rush then into the
room, and the former came out in a minute, and going to his own apartment 
shut
the door.  They thought that they then heard him fall at full length upon 
the
floor.  All was mystery.

     "I'm bewildered," said the landlord, "What _is_ it all about?"

     "And where is Mr. Black?" asked Mr. Lake.

     "Here," cried a waiter as he pointed to an insensible form lying so 
close
to the table, that nobody had as yet noticed it.  "Here he is.  He looks as 
if
he was dead."

     Poor Mr. Black was lifted up, his eyes were closed as well as his 
mouth,
and he seemed to breathe with difficulty.  He was placed in a chair, and 
then
held, while water was dashed in his face to recover him, and after a time,
just as one of the waiters who had been sent for the surgeon again who had
before attended the young lady, made his appearance with that gentleman, he
slowly opened his eyes.

     "Oh! mercy, mercy!  Where am I now?"

     "What is all this about?" inquired the medical man.

     "Nobody knows sir," said the landlord, "that's the beauty of it.  But 
the
young lady is very bad again; will you, wife, show the doctor into her room.
Good God, I shall go out of my wits, and my hotel that has a character 
forming
one of the quietest in all London-- yes, the quietest I may say.  I'm a 
ruined
man."

     "Mr. Black," said Mr. Lake, "I implore you if you can to tell the 
meaning
of all this."

     "All-- all I know," said Mr. Black faintly.  "All I know, --"

     Everybody gathered round him to listen, and with looks of fright and
apprehension, and a trembling voice, he said: --

     "I-- I was sitting here waiting for Mr. Lake to come back with the 
night
porter, for we had some cause to wish for further help, when somebody came
suddenly up to me, and struck me down.  The blow was on the top of my head,
and so severe, that I fell as if shot."

     "And then? and then?"

     "Nothing.  I don't know anything else till you recovered me, and then, 
I
seemed as if all the place was scouring round me; and then--"

     "But, Mr. Black, cannot you tell us who struck you?  What was he like?
Could you identify him again?"

     "I fear not.  Indeed I hardly saw more of him than that he was tall."

     "Well," cried Mr. Lake, "all I can say is that I have had my suspicions
since last night, and now I am certain, that is to say circumstantially
certain.  What say you, landlord?  Is there not one person in the house who
may not fairly enough be suspected."

     He looked towards the door of Mr. Blue's room, as he spoke, and indeed
all eyes were turned in that direction, and the landlord mustering up 
courage
advanced to the door and said, as he did so, "We will have him out.  He 
shall
not stay another hour on my premises.  We will have him out, I say.  This 
sort
of thing won't do, and it shall not do.  We will have him out.  I say
gentlemen we will have him out."

     One thing was quite clear, and that was that the landlord wanted 
somebody
to come forward, and assist him in having out Mr. Blue; but when he found 
that
nobody stirred he turned round at the door, and looked rather foolish.

     Under any other circumstances, perhaps, this conduct might have excited
the risible faculties of all who were present; but the affair, take it all 
in
all, was of too mysterious and serious a character to indulge in any 
laughter
about.

     "I," said Mr. Lake, advancing, "will have him out, if nobody else 
will!"

     It would appear as if Mr. Blue had been listening to what was going on;
for on the instant, he flung open his door, and said, --

     "Who will have me out, and what for?"

     "Vampire, vampire," cried a chorus of voices.

     "Idiots!" said Mr. Blue.

     "Detain him!" sad Mr. Lake; "detain him, we shall never be satisfied
until this affair is thoroughly and judicially enquired into.  Detain him I
say."

     "Let him who sets no value on his life," said Mr. Blue, "lay but a hand
upon me, and he shall have to admire the consequences of his rashness.  I am
not one to be trifled with; it is my fancy to leave this hotel this moment 
let
any one dare to stand in my way[.]"

     "Your name is not Blue," said the landlord, "you are not what you 
seem."

     "Granted."

     "Ah! you admit it," said Lake.  "Lay hold of him, I will give ten 
pounds
for him dead or alive; I have often heard of vampires, and by Heaven, I now
believe in them.  Seize him, I say, seize him."

     He dashed forward himself, as he spoke, and was on the point of seizing
hold of Mr. Blue, when one well-directed blow from that individual sent him
sprawling.  After this nobody showed any very marked disposition to attack
him, but he was allowed to walk calmly and slowly down the staircase of the
hotel; while Lake gathered himself up, looking rather confused at the tumble
he had had.  But his passion was not subdued, for he made a rush still after
the supposed vampire, but he was too late.  The hotel door was closed with a
bang, that reverberated through the house, and Mr. Blue was gone, vampire, 
or
no vampire.

     "Landlord, I shall leave your house," said Lake.

     "I'm ruined," said the landlord.  "This affair will get into some 
Sunday
paper.  Mr. Black, what is to be done?"

     "Really, the top of my head is so hurt," replied Mr. Black, "that I can
think of nothing else."

     "A plague upon the top of your head," muttered the landlord.

     The Lakes now, that is Mr. and Mrs. Lake found their way to the young
lady's chamber, when they found her in a state of great alarm.  The story 
she
told amounted to this: --

     She was asleep, she said, having perfect confidence that no harm could
come to her, while the door of her room was watched in the way it was.  She
had a light burning in her room, but it was one that gave a very faint 
light,
as she had usually an objection to sleeping otherwise than in profound
darkness; but she had no notion of how long she had been asleep, when she 
was
awakened by a hand being placed over her mouth, which prevented her from
breathing.

     She struggled to free herself but it was in vain.  The monster attacked
her on the neck with his teeth, and all she remembered was getting
sufficiently free to utter one scream, and then she fainted away.

     "My dear," said Mrs. Lake, "I must have some serious talk with you upon 
a
subject which I have before urged.  Go away, Lake."

     Lake left the room, and then, Mrs. Lake continued.

     "This is a very dreadful affair, Annetta.  You know that it is fancied
you are not the child of Lord Lake, and that we have the care of you.  Now 
we
so much love and admire you, --"

     "Stop madam, stop," said the young lady, "I know what you are about to
say, you are going to urge me again to marry your son, which I will never 
do,
for I have the greatest aversion to him."

     "You will not? who will protect you from a vampire better than a
husband."

     "Probably no one, but at least I reserve to myself the right to choose 
to
whom I give that task, I am ill now and weak, I pray you not to weary me
further upon a subject concerning which it is quite impossible we can ever
agree.  I only wish I were dead."

     "And that you may very well soon be if your blood is all sucked away by 
a
vampire."

     "So be it.  Heaven help me!"

     "Pshaw! you may die as soon as you like."

 Next Time: The Meeting in St. James's Park.




                             CHAPTER CXVIII [sic]

                               [Chapter 186]


THE MEETING IN ST. JAMES'S PARK.


     Another day passed over at the London Hotel, and as Mr. Blue had been
kind enough to take his departure, and that departure seemed to be final, 
for
he did not show himself again, Mr. Lake rescinded the resolution he had made
to leave.

     Probably it was much more convenient for him to stay, although he
pretended that he did so out of consideration for the landlord, who ought 
not
to be punished for innocently harbouring so suspicious a character as Mr.
Blue, whether he were a vampire, or not.

     But the day, as we say, has passed away, and it is about half-past 
eight
o'clock in the evening, and quite dark, for the moon did not rise for an 
hour
afterwards, when Mr. Lake might have been seen making his way towards Saint
James's Park.

     He entered it by the narrow mode of ingress by Spring Gardens, and made
his way towards the palace of Saint James, that is to say, the wall of its
private gardens that look upon the park; and then, under some shady trees, 
he
paused and looked inquiringly about him.

     "He was to have been here a little before nine," he muttered.  "Hush!"

     The Horse Guards clock chimed three-quarters past eight.

     Mr. Lake draw back, as two men came at a slow pace towards where he
stood, and then he muttered, --

     "It is Miller, but confound him, who is that he has brought with him?
Hang the fellow! I did not give him leave to make a confident in this 
ticklish
piece of business."

     One of the men only now advanced, leaving the other about twelve paces
from him.

     "Mr. L---, I think," he said.

     "Yes, Miller, it is I; but who in the name of all that's infernal have
you brought with you?  Are you mad to trust to anybody but yourself?"

     "Oh, don't trouble yourself about that, sir.  The fact is, he has been
with me for a number of years; he is my managing clerk, and as great a rogue
as you would wish him to be.  I cannot keep anything wholly from him, so the
best way, I find, is to make a confident of him at once."

     "I don't half like it."

     "You may thoroughly depend upon Lee, that is his name, and you never 
knew
such a rogue as he is, sir; besides, somebody, you know, must have been
trusted to personate the father, and he will do that, and then, you know
likewise, sir, that----"

     "Hush, hush! speak lower! will you? bring this accomplished rogue this
way, since I must do business, it seems, with him!  Call him here, Miller, 
and
we will talk as we walk on, that is always safer than holding a conference 
in
one spot, near which any one may hide; but it is a much more difficult thing
for a spy to follow and overhear you at the same time."

     "You have a genius, Mr. Lake."

     "Bah!  I don't want any compliments from you, Miller; we want downright
business."

     By this time, Mr. Miller had made a sig[n] to his clerk, Lee, to come 
up,
which that individual did, and at once saluted Mr. Lake, and made some 
trivial
remark about the weather, in an off-hand way.

     Mr Lake made rather a distant reply and then he said, --

     "I presume, sir, that Mr. Miller has made you acquainted with the 
affair
in which, it seems, I am to purchase your kind co-operation?"

     "Oh no," said Miiller, "I have certainly given him a brief outline, but 
I
always prefer that the principal himself should give all the directions
possible to every one, and tell his own story."

     "Well, sir, I think you might as well have told him, and not given me 
the
trouble.  But, however, if I must, I must; so pray attend to me sir."

     "I will," said Lee.

     "My brother then, is Lord Lake.  It's a new title rather, as our father
was the first who had it, and he left large estates to my brother, and to 
his
son if he had one, or his daughter, if he had one.  The title descending to
heir males, I must have the title by outliving my brother, if I do, but hang 
it
all, she [sic] has a daughter, and she will have the estates."

     "I comprehend."

     "The old countess of Bhackbighte smuggled the child away at its birth,
and took care of it for a consideration that used up two-thirds of my 
income,
but the old cat on her death confessed that the child was Lord Lakes's, but
luckily, you see, without criminating me.  Now Mr. Miller was her solicitor,
and so between us we have forged a letter supposed to be found among the old
countess's papers, in which she states that she intends to palm off a child 
as
the Lord Lakes when she is dying, but that his child really did die, you 
see."

     "Oh yes."

     "Now this has had an effect upon Lord Lake, who to some extent had
repudiated the girl, and what I want is to clinch the matter, by providing
some one who will actually own her."

     "I understand." said Lee, "but it will be an awkward affair if found
out."

     "I want to provide against any consequences of a disagreeable nature, 
by
getting her to marry my son, but I don't think she will.  Absolute distress 
to
which I am determined to bring her, if I can, may move her to that step, and
then all's right.  The secret is in my hands to play with, as I think 
proper."

     "A very good plan."

     "You see, there's a lover of hers too, a young officer in the Guards, 
but
he will be off as soon as he finds that she's the daughter of a lawyer's 
clerk
instead of a lord-- ha! ha! ha!"

     "Likely enough.  I'll father her."

     "Thank you; and now about money matters.  Miller gets a thousand 
pounds--
what do you want?  Be moderate."

     "I ought to have five hundred pounds to pay me."

     "The deuce!  Well, I don't want to stint you.  But you will bear in 
mind
that that is very good pay; and now we must get up a first rate story, so
complete in all its parts that there shall be no sort of doubt about it, you
see-- a story that will stand the test of examination and criticism."

     "That can be better done in my chambers," said the attorney; "I think 
now
we understand each other perfectly well, and that we need hardly say any 
more
just at present.  Money matters are settled, and as Mr. Lee has once
undertaken the business, I am quite satisfied, for one, that it will be well
done."

     "I am glad to hear you say that, Miller, and I am quite reconciled, 
which
I must own I was not at first, to Mr. Lee having a finger in the pie."

     "Thank you," said Lee, "thank you; we shall manage it all right, no
doubt.  Indeed now that you have fully explained it to me, it seems quite an
easy and straightforward affair."

     "You think so."

     "I certainly do think so."

     "Then you take off my mind a load of anxiety for thought it would be a
difficult thing to arrange, and require no end of chicanery and trouble, but
yon [sic] quite reassure-- you quite reasure [sic] me, Mr. Lee."

     "Oh, these things are done every day, my dear sir."

     They had walked to and fro as they spoke till now, by the time they had
settled their affairs thus far, they stood by the centre of the principal
mall.  The park was very quiet, and had quite a deserted aspect.  Indeed, it
was near the time when there would be more difficulty in travering [sic] it 
in
consequence of the extra vigilance of the night sentinels.

     The moon faded gradually away, or seemed to fade away as the light 
fleecy
clouds swept over it's face, and the parties who had held this interesting
dialogue separated.  Mr. Lake walked hurriedly towards his hotel, and the
attorney and his accomplice stood for a few moments conversing in whispers.
They then turned towards the Green Park, and as they did so, they were 
crossed
by a tall, spectral-looking figure wrapped up in an immense cloak, but who 
did
not seem to observe them, for his eyes were fixed upon the moon, which at 
that
moment again began to emerge from the clouds.

     He stretched forth his arms as if he would have held the beautiful
satellite to his heart.

     "An odd fish," whispered the attorney.

     "Very," said his companion.  "I should like now to know who he is."

     The attorney shrugged his shoulders, as he said, "Some harmless lunatic
most likely.  They say that such often wander all night about the parks."

     "That's strange; only look at him now.  he seems to be worshipping the
moon, and now how he strides along; and see, there is another man meets him,
and they both hold up their arms in that strange way to the moon.  What on
earth can be the meaning of it?"

     "I really don't know."

     "Some religious fanatics, perhaps."

     "Ah! that's as likely as not.  We have all sorts of them, jumpers and
screamers and tearers, and why not a few who may call themselves Lunarians.
For my part I would rather worship the moon than I would, as most church and
chapel going women do, worship some canting evangelical thief of a parson, 
who
has-- oh dear! such elegant hands, and such whiskers, and speaks so soft and
impressive.  Of all the rougues on earth, I do detest those in surplices!"

 Next Time: The Churchyard at Hampstead. -- The Resuscitation of a Vampire.




                             CHAPTER CLXIX [sic]

                               [Chapter 187]


THE CHURCHYARD AT HAMPSTEAD. -- THE RESUSCITATION OF A VAMPIRE.


     It wants half an hour to midnight.  The sky is still cloudy, but
glimpses of the moon can be got as occasionally the clouds slip om [sic]
before her disc, and then what a glorious flood of silver light spread 
itself
over the landscape.

     And a landscape in every respect more calculated to look beautiful and
rowantic [sic] under the chaste moon's ray, than that to which we would now
invite attention, certainly could not have been found elsewhere, within many 
a
mile of London.  It is Hampstead Heath, that favoured spot where upon a 
small
scale are collected some of the rarest landscape beauties that the most
romantic mountainous counties of England can present to the gratified eye of
the tourist.

     Those who are familiar with London and its environs, of course, are 
well
acquainted with every nook, glade, tree, and dell in that beautiful heath,
where, at all and every time and season, there is much to recommend that
semi-wild spot to notice.  Indeed, if it were, as it ought to be, divested 
of
its donkey-drivers and laundresses, a more delightful place of residence 
could
scarcely be found than some one of those suburban villas, that are dotted
round the margin of this picturesque waste.

     But it is midnight, nearly.  That time is forthcoming, at which popular
superstition trembles -- that time, at which the voice of ignorance and of
cant lowers to whispers, and when the poor of heart and timid of spirit
imagine worlds of unknown terrors.  On this occasion, though, it will be 
seen
that there would have been some excuses if even the most bold had shrunk 
back
appalled at what was taking place.

     But we will not anticipate for truly in this instance might we say
sufficient for the time are the horrors thereof.

     If any one had stood on that portion of the high road which leads right
over the heath and so on to Hendon or to Highgate, according as the left 
hand
or the right hand route is taken, and after reaching the Castle Tavern, had
looked across the wide expanse of heath to the west, they would have seen
nothing for a while but the clustering bushes of heath blossom, and the
picturesque fir trees, that there are to be beheld in great luxuriance.  
But,
after a time, something of a more noticeable character would have presented
itself.

     At a quarter to twelve there rose up from a tangled mass of brushwood,
which had partially concealed a deep cavernous place where sand had been 
dug,
a human form, and there it stood in the calm still hour of night so 
motionless
that it scarcely seemed to possess life, but presently another rose at a 
short
distance.

     And then there was a third, so that these three strange-looking beings
stood like landmarks against the sky, and when the moon shone out from some
clouds which had for a short time obscured her rays, they looked strange and
tall, and superhuman.

     One spoke.

     "'Tis time," he said, in a deep, hollow voice, that sounded as if it 
came
from the tomb.

     "Yes, time," said another.

     "Time has come," said the third.

     Then they moved, and by the gestures they used, it seemed as if an
animated discussion was taking place among them, after which they moved 
along
in perfect silence, and in a most stately manner, towards the village of
Hampstead.

     Before reaching it, however, they turned down some narrow shaded walks
among garden walls, and the backs of stables, until they emerged close to 
the
old churchyard, which stands on high ground, and which was not then -- at
least, the western portion of it -- overlooked by any buildings.  Those 
villas
which now skirt it, are of recent elevation.

     A dense mass of clouds has now been brought up by a south wind, and had
swept over the face of the moon, so that at this juncture, and as twelve
o'clock might be expected every moment to strike, the night was darker than 
it
had yet been since sunset.  The circumstance was probably considered by the
mysterious beings who sought the churchyard as favourable to them, and they
got without difficulty within those sacred precincts devoted to the dead.

     Scarcely had they found the way a dozen feet among the old tomb-stones,
when from behind a large square monument, there appeared two more persons; 
and
if the attorney, Mr. Miller, had been there, he would probably have thought
they bore such a strong resemblance to those whom he had seen in the park, 
he
would have had but little hesitation in declaring that they were the same.

     These two persons joined the other three, who manifested no surprise at
seeing them, and then the whole five stood close to the wall of the church, 
so
that they were quite secure from observation, and one of them spoke.

     "Brothers," he said, "you who prey upon human nature by the law of your
being, we have work to do to-night-- that work which we never leave undone,
and which we dare not neglect when we know that it is to do.  One of our
fraternity lies here."

     "Yes," said the others, with the exception of one, and he spoke
passionately.

     "Why," he said, "when there were enough, and more than enough, to do 
the
work, summon me?"

     "Not more than enough, there are but five."

     "And why should you not be summoned," said another, "you are one of us.
You ought to do your part with us in setting a brother free from the clay 
that
presses on his breast."

     "I was engaged in my vocation.  If the moon shine out in all her lustre
again, you will see that I am wan and wasted, and have need of---"

     "Blood," said one.

     "Blood, blood, blood," repeated the others.  And then the first speaker
said, to him who complained," [sic] --

     "You are one whom we are glad to have with us on a service of danger.
You are strong and bold, your deeds are known, you have lived long, and are
not yet crushed."

     "I do not know our brother's name," said one of the others with an air 
of
curiosity.

     "I go by many."

     "So do we all.  But by what name may we know you best."

     "Slieghton, I was named in the reign of the third Edward.  But many 
have
known me as Varney, the Vampyre!"

     There was a visible sensation among those wretched beings as these 
words
were uttered, and one was about to say something, when Varney interrupted 
him.

     "Come," he said, "I have been summoned here, and I have come to assist 
in
the exhumation of a brother.  It is one of the conditions of our being that 
we
do so.  Let the work be proceeded with then, at once, I have no time to 
spare.
Let it be done with.  Where lies the vampyre?  Who was he?"

     "A man of good repute, Varney," said the first speaker.  "A smooth,
fair-spoken man, a religious man, so far as cant went, a proud, cowardly,
haughty, worldly follower of religion.  Ha, ha, ha!"

     "And what made him one of us?"

     "He dipped his hands in blood.  There was a poor boy, a brother's only
child, 'twas left an orphan.  He slew the boy, and he is one of us."

     "With a weapon."

     "Yes, and a sharp one; the weapon of unkindness.  The child was young 
and
gentle, and harsh words, blows, and revilings placed him in his grave.  he 
is
in heaven, while the man will be a vampyre."

     "'Tis well-- dig him up."

     They each produced from under the dark cloaks they wore, a short
double-edged, broad, flat-bladed weapon, not unlike the swords worn by the
Romans, and he who assumed the office of guide, led the way to a newly-made
grave, and dillegently, and with amazing rapidity and power, they commenced
removing the earth.

     It was something amazing to see the systematic manner in which they
worked, and in ten minutes one of them struck the blade of his weapon upon 
the
lid of a coffin, and said,

     "It is here."

     The lid was then partially raised in the direction of the moon, which,
although now hidden, they could see would in a very short time show itself 
in
some gaps of the clouds, that were rapidly approaching at great speed across
the heavens.

     They then desisted from their labour, and stood around the grave in
silence for a time, until, as the moon was longer showing her fair face, 
they
began to discourse in whispers.

     "What shall become of him," said one, ponting [sic] to the grave.  
"Shall
we aid him."

     "No," said Varney, "I have heard that of him which shall not induce me 
to
lift hand or voice in his behalf.  Let him fly, shrieking like a frightened
ghost where he lists."

     "Did you not once know some people named Bannerworth."

     "I did.  You came to see me, I think, at an inn.  They are all dead."

     "Hush," said another, "look, the moon will soon be free from the 
vapours
that sail between it and the green earth.  Behold, she shines out fresh once
more; there will be life in the coffin soon, and our work will be done."

     It was so.  The dark clouds passed over the face of the moon, and with 
a
sudden burst of splendour, it shone out again as before.

 Next Time: The Vampyre. -- The Flight. -- The Watchman in the Vale of 
Health.



                             CHAPTER CLXX. [sic]

                               [Chapter 188]

THE VAMPYRE. -- THE FLIGHT. -- THE WATCHMAN IN THE VALE OF HEALTH.


     A death-like stillness now was over the whole scene, and those who had
partially exhumed the body stood as still as statues, waiting the event 
which
they looked forward to as certain to ensue.

     The clear beauty and intensity of the moonbeams increased each moment,
and the whole surrounding landscape was lit up with a perfect flood of soft,
silvery light.  The old church stood out in fine relief, and every tree, and
every wild flower, and every blade of grass in the churchyard, could be seen
in its finest and most delicate proportions and construction.

     The lid of the coffin was wrenched up on one side to about six inches 
in
height, and that side faced the moon, so that some rays, it was quite 
clearly
to be seen, found their way into that sad receptacle for the dead.  A 
quarter
of an hour, however, passed away, and nothing happened.

     "Are you certain he is one of us?" whispered Varney.

     "Quite, I have known it years past.  He had the mark upon him."

     "Enough.  Behold."

     A deep and dreadful groan came from the grave, and yet it could hardly 
be
called a groan; it was more like a howl, and the lid which was partially 
open,
was visibly agitated.

     "He comes," whispered one.

     "Hush," said another, "hush; our duty will be done when he stands upon
the level ground.  Hush, let him hear nothing, let him know nothing, since 
we
will not aid him.  Behold, behold."

     They all looked down into the grave, but they betrayed no signs of
emotion, and the sight they saw there was such as one would have supposed
would have created emotion in the breast of any one at all capable of
feeling.  But then we must not reason upon these strange frightful 
existences
as we reason upon human nature such as we usually know it.

     The coffin lid was each moment more and more agitated.  The deep
frightful groans increased in number and sound, and then the corpse 
stretched
out one ghastly hand from the open crevice and grasped despairingly and
frantically at the damp earth that was around.

     There was still towards one side of the coffin sufficient weight of 
mould
that it would require some strenght [sic] to turn it off, but as the dead 
man
struggled within his narrow house it kept falling aside in lumps, so that 
his
task of exhumation became each moment an easier one.

     At length he uttered a strange wailing shriek, and by a great effort
succeeded in throwing the coffin lid quite open, and then he sat up, looking
so horrible and ghastly in the grave clothes, that even the vampyres that 
were
around that grave recoiled a little.

     "Is it done?" said Varney.

     "Not yet," said he who had summoned the to the fearful rite, and so
assumed a sort of direction over them, "not yet; we will not assist him, but
we may not leave him before telling him who and what he is."

     "Do so now."

     The corpse stood up in the coffin, and the moonlight fell full upon 
him.

     "Vampyre arise," said he who had just spoken to Varney.  "Vampyre 
arise,
and do your work in the world until your doom shall be accomplished.  
Vampyre
arise-- arise.  Pursue your victims in the mansion and in the cottage.  Be a
terror and a desolation, go you where you may, and if the hand of death 
strike
you down, the cold beams of the moon shall restore you to new life.  Vampyre
arise, arise!"

     "I come, I come!" shrieked the corpse.

     In another moment the five vampyres who had dug him from the grave were
gone.

     Moaning, shrieking, and groaning he made some further attempts to get 
out
of the deep grave.  He clutched at it in vain, the earth crumbled beneath 
him,
and it was only at last by dint of reaching up and dragging in the displaced
material that lay in a heap at the sides, so that in a few minutes it formed 
a
mound for him to stand upon in the grave, and he was at length able to get
out.

     Then, although he sighed, and now and then uttered a wailing shriek as 
he
went about his work, he with a strange kind of instinct, began to carefully
fill up the grave from which he had but just emerged, nor did he cease from
his occupation until he had finished it, and so carefully shaped the mound 
of
mould and turf over it that no one would have thought it had been disturbed.

     When this work was done a kind of madness seemed to seize him, and he
walked to the gate of the grave yard, which opens upon Church-street, and
placing his hands upon the sides of his mouth he produced such an appalling
shriek that it must have awakened everybody in Hampstead.

     Then, turning, he fled like a hunted hare in the other direction, and
taking the first turning to the right ran up a lane called Frognal-lane, and
which is parallel to the town, for a town Hampstead may be fairly called 
now,
although it was not then.

     By pursuing this lane, he got upon the outskirts of the heath, and then
turning to the right again, for, with a strange pertinacity he always kept, 
as
far as he could, his face towards the light of the moon, he rushed down a 
deep
hollow, where there was a cluster of little cottages, enjoying such repose
that one would have thought the flutter of an awakened bird upon the wing
would have been heard.

     It was quite clear that the new vampyre had as yet no notion of what he
was about, or where he was going, and that he was with mere frantic haste
speeding along, from the first impulse of his frightful nature.

     The place into which he had now plunged, is called the Vale of Health:
now a place of very favourite resort, but then a mere collection of white
faced cottages, with a couple of places that might be called villas.  A
watchman went his nightly rounds in that place.  And it so happened that the
guardian of the Vale had just roused himself up at this juncture, and made 
up
his mind to make his walk of observation, when he saw the terrific figure of 
a
man attired in grave clothes coming along with dreadful speed towards him, 
as
if to take the Vale of Health by storm.

     The watchman was so paralysed by fear that he could not find strength
enough to spring his rattle, although he made the attempt, and held it out 
at
arm's length, while his eyes glared with perfect ferocity, and his mouth was
wide enough open to nourish the idea, that after all he had a hope of being
able to swallow the spectre.

     But, nothing heeding him, the vampyre came wildly on.

     Fain now would the petrified watchman have got out of the way, but he
could not, and in another moment he was dashed down to the earth, and 
trodden
on by the horrible existence that knew not what it did.

     A cloud came over the moon, and the vampyre sunk down, exhausted, by a
garden-wall, and there lay as if dead, while the watchman, who had fairly
fainted away, lay in a picturesque attitude on his back, not very far off.

     Half an hour passed, and a slight mist-like rain began to fall.

     The vampyre slowly rose to his feet, and commenced wringing his hands 
and
moaning, but his former violence of demeanour had passed away.  That was but
the first flush of new life, and now he seemed to be more fully aware of who
and what he was.

     He shivered as he tottered slowly on, until he came to where the 
watchman
lay, and then he divested that guardian of the Vale of his greatcoat, his 
hat,
and some other portions of his apparel, all of which he put on himself, 
still
slightly moaning as he did so, and ever and anon stopping to make a gesture 
of
despair.

     When this operation was completed, he slunk off into a narrow path 
which
led on to the heath again, and there he seemed to waver a little, whether he
would go towards London, or the country.  At length it seemed that he 
decided
upon the former course, and he walked on at a rapid pace right through
Hampstead, and down the hill towards London, the lights of which would be 
seen
gleaming in the distance.

     When the watchman did recover himself, the first thing he did was, to 
be
kind enough to rouse every body up from their sleep in the Vale of Health, 
by
springing his rattle at a prodigious rate, and by the time he had roused up
the whole neighbourhood, he felt almost ready to faint again at the bare
recollection of the terrible apparition that had knocked him down.

     The story in the morning was told all over the place, with many 
additions
to it of course, and it was long afterwards before the inhabitants of the 
Vale
could induce another watchman, for that one gave up the post, to run the 
risk
of such a visitation.

     And the oddest thing of all was, that the watchman declared that he
caught a glance at the countenance, and that it was like that of a Mr. 
Brooks,
who had only been buried the day previous, that if he had not known that
gentleman to be dead and buried, he should have thought it was he himself 
gone
mad.

     But there was the grave of Mr. Brooks, with its circular mound of 
earth,
all right enough; and then Mr. B. was known to have been such a respectable
man.  He went to the city every day, and used to do so just for the purpose 
of
granting audiences to ladies and gentlemen who might be labouring under any
little pecuniary difficulties, and accommodating them.  Kind Mr. Brooks.  He
only took one hundred pounds per cent.  Why should he be a Vampyre?  Bless
him!  Too severe, really!

     There were people who called him a bloodsucker while he lived, and now 
he
was one practically, and yet he had his own pew at the church, and 
subscribed
a whole guinea a year to a hospital -- he did, although people did say it 
was
in order that he might pack off any of his servants at once to it in case of
illness.  But then the world is so censorious.

     To this day the watchman's story of the apparition that visited the 
Vale
of Health is talked of by the old women who make what they call tea for 
Sunday
parties at nine pence a head.  But it is time now that we go back to London,
and see what is taking place at the hotel where the Lakes are staying, and 
how
the villany of the uncle thrives -- that villany of which he actually had 
the
face to give such an exposition to Mr. Lee the clerk of the attorney.

     Let us hope that the right will still overcome the injustice that is
armed against it, and that Lord Lake and his beautiful child may not fall
victims to the machinations that are brought into play agianst them, by 
those
who ought to have been their best friends.

 Next Time: Miss Lake Passes a Fearful Night. -- The Impostor Punishe [sic]

                               [Chapter 189]

MISS LAKE PASSES A FEARFUL NIGHT. -- THE IMPOSTOR PUNISHE [sic]


     The landlord of the London Hotel made every possible exertion to keep a
profound secret the events of the night, but people will talk when even they
have not anything particular to say, so that we cannot wonder at their doing
so when they have.

     In fact the story of the vampyre at the London Hotel got known pretty
well half over London in the course of the day succeeding that second 
attempt
upon the life blood of the young lady, who had become the object of attack
from the monster.

     Mr. Lake was in a strange frame of mind as regarded the whole affair.  
He
did not yet know whether to really believe it or not -- whether to ascribe 
it,
after all, to a dream, or, as Mrs. Lake hinted, for she was a woman fond of
scheming herself, so always ready to suggest its existence in others -- a 
mere
plan upon the part of the young girl to get rid of the projected alliance 
with
young Master Lake, and possibly evoke the sympathy of all who heard her 
story.

     This view of the matter however, although it did not make much 
impression
upon Mr. Lake, suggested a something to him, that he thought would chime in
well with his other plans and projects.

     "If," he said "I could but instill a little courage into my son he 
might
now, at all events make a favourable impression upon his cousin."

     Full of this idea, he summoned the young gentleman to a conference with
him, and having carefully closed the door, he said in a low confidential 
tone,
--

     "Of course you have heard all about this-- this vampyre business?"

     "Yes, govenor, to be sure I have.  Who could fail of hearing all about
it?  Why, nobody in the house will talk about anything else.  I'm afraid to 
go
to bed, I can tell you; that is to say, for fear I should do anything rash,
you know, that's all."

     "I understand you, and it's no use blinking the fact to me, that you 
are
a coward."

     "I am a coward, I-- oh, you are very much mistaken.  I'm a long way off
that.  I'm only always desirous of getting out of the way when anything
happens, for fear of doing a rash act; it's excess of courage you know--
that's what alarms me."

     "Well, there are cases in which there would be no harm resulting, were
you ever so rash."

     "Ah! only show me one, and then you'll see."

     "Very well, your cousin, you know-- and you know she is you cousin--
won't have you.  Now, unless you are married to her, all our nicely got up
plans are liable to be blasted by any accident, or by any breath of 
treachery
that may come across them.  But if you were the husband of your cousin,
policy, habit, and, indeed, everything would combine to induce Lord Lake and
her to smother up the affair.  You comprehend."

     "But what am I to do, if she won't have me?"

     "I will tell you.  You must awaken her gratitude by rescuing her from 
all
these foolish terrors about vampyres, and when once a woman feels and knows
that a man has done a brave act in her behalf, the principal entrance to her
heart is open to him."

     "Oh, but-- I-- I-- the vampyre; that's rather unpleasant."

     "Come, now, you are not such a fool, as really to believe that it's,
after all, anything but a mere dream.  Don't tell me.  Vampyres, indeed!  At
all events you can vapour as much as you like upon that subject without any
danger occurring."

     "Yes, yes-- you may think so."

     "I know so.  Listen to me."

     The son did listen, and the father added:

     "You must volunteer to watch alone by your cousin's door for this
vampyre, and of course nothing will think of coming.  It's too ridiculous
altogher, that it is; so, you see, you run no risk at all.  You comprehend
that?"

     "Well, but if I run no risk, I don't see what's the use of doing it, 
you
know; for if all is quite, how can she be grateful to me for having rescued
her from nothing at all?"

     "Very well put, very well indeed.  But as there will be nothing really 
to
rescue her from, suppose we make something that will just suit our own
purposes."

     "What do you mean?"

     "Why, you know my great grey travelling cloak-- what is to hinder you
having that with you, and whenever you are quite certain that your cousin is
fast asleep, you can put that on over your face partially, and go into the
room, and pretend to be the vampyre, and when she is in a paroxysm of terror
do you dash out the light, and then in your natural voice, cry out, 'Ah,
wretch, I have you, I have you.  How dare you invade the sanctity of this
chamber?' and all that sort of thing, you know, and you can knock about the
chairs as much as you like, so as to induce the belief that you are engaged 
in
a deadly struggle, and then you call for lights, and you are there, and the
vampyre gone."

     "Well, I rather like that, and if I were quite sure---"

     "Of what?"

     "That there was no real vampyre, you know, why I wouldn't mind it."

     "Pshaw!"

     "Well, well, I'll do it, I'll do it, I tell you.  I see all the
importance of getting her for my wife.  Ahem! and if I do," he added to
himself aside, "I'll take deuced good care you don't get hold of the money,
for after we are married, I shall just tell Lord Lake all about it."

     During the day Mr. Lake had sought an opportunity of speaking to Mr.
Black.

     "My dear sir," he said to him, you don't seem well at all, and I shall
insist that you do not trouble yourself to watch to-night by the door of the
young lady, who has had so disagreeable a visitor."

     "I am certainly not quite well," said Mr. Black.  "The fact is, my 
health
will not bear anything like a shock; a family occurrence has so shattered my
nerves."

     "My dear sir, say no more; you shall have no more trouble about us.  My
son who loves his cousin, and is quite jealous of anybody defending her but
himself, will watch alone by her door.  He has great courage when once his
spirit is up, and it is now."

     "I'm glad to hear it: it takes some time to get it up!"

     "Why, a-- a-- yes, sometimes."

     "I must be on the look out myself tonight, or the cowardly fellow will
spoil all," thought Mr. Lake; "any unusual noise in the house, I suppose, 
will
be almost sufficient to induce him to faint away.  Confound his cowardice, 
it
mars all."

     Mr. Lake was not by any means so clear in his own mind as he pretended 
to
be of the fact of the vampyre being only a delusion and a creation of the
brain of his niece; so when the evening came, he did all that was in his 
power
to keep the courage of his son to the mark.

     He even took care that he should have a glass of something strong and
hot, for he knew by personal experience that while they lasted, the fumes of
hot alcohol did something for a weak heart.

     But what pleased Mr. Lake most of all was the ease with which he had 
thus
managed matters with Mr. Miller and his clerk, who he had no doubt, would
fabricate such a story as would convince the single minded Annetta of his
claims to be her father.

     "Then," thought the old Lake, "we can surely among us badger her into
marrying my son.  Oh, it will be all right.  Let no plot henceforward hope 
to
succeed if this one does not.  It must, and it shall; it shall, and it 
must."

     It's all very well of any one to say that a scheme shall succeed;

     "But how light a breath of air will chase away,
     The darkly woven fancies of a thousand plots."

     Mr. Lake stood upon a precipice which he little saw, or the terrific
height of it would have driven him distracted.

     Miss Lake was in a great state of mental depression; if anything, more
than another was calculated to thoroughly break down the spirits of a young
and innocent girl, it certainly would be such circumstances as those which 
now
surrounded her, and deprived too, as she was, of that aid and sympathy she
would have received at the hands of a father or a mother, it was only a 
wonder
that she did not sink under the affliction most completely.

     She made no objection to young Lake watching by the outside of her 
door.
Indeed, she was weeping and depressed, so that she could scarcely know what
proposal was made to her.

     "I shall not sleep," she said.  "God knows what will become of me."

     "Do not despair, all may be well; it was a very sad thing that my 
brother
Lord Lake ever found out that you were not his daughter.  I'm sure I would
have given freely all I possessed to have averted any such news, for it has
attacked both his happiness and yours."

     The young girl made no reply to this, but the look she gave him was 
quite
sufficient to show him how much she doubted the sincerity of the professions
of friendship and affection for her that fell from his lips.  There was a
something in his hollow, heartless character which, young and innocent and
unknowing in the ways of the world even as that young girl was, she saw
through, and he felt that she did so.

     This was the most provoking thing of all that his heartlesness [sic] 
and
selfishness should be transparent to one so young as she was.

     But the night came at last, and with it the fidgetty fears of young 
Lake
increased mightily.  He was all of a shake, as Slop the waiter said, like a
lot of jelly.

     It was only by repeated doses of brandy-and-water that he kept himself
from declaring off the adventure altogether, so that by eleven o'clock at
night he was in a terrible state between fear and intoxication; and as any 
two
impulses will each do its best to defeat the other, he was prevented from
getting entirely drunk by his fears, and from getting entirely afraid by the
liquor.

     But at last he did actually take his place by the door of the chamber
occupied by his cousin, and then with a table before him on which were 
lights,
brandy-and-water, and cigars, he prepared to go through what to him was a
terrible ordeal.

     "You-- you-- really think," he whispered to his father, who came to
promise him that he would not undress himself, but remain in his own room
within call, "you really think there is no vampyre?"

     "Tut, tut."

     "Well, but really now, really--"

     "Have I not told you before?  Come, come, nonsense, there's the old 
grey
travelling cloak, put it under the table, and now I shall leave you; its 
about
half-past eleven, and you have nothing in the world to do but just to enjoy
yourself, you know.  Good night."

 Next Time: The Vampyre Discovered. -- The Escape on the Thames.




                            CHAPTER CLXXII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 190]

THE VAMPYRE DISCOVERED. -- THE ESCAPE ON THE THAMES.


     "Enjoy myself!" muttered the young Lake, "enjoy myself!  That may be 
his
idea of staying here vampyre-catching, but it ain't mine.  What a fool I was
to consent to come here, to be sure, and all alone too.  Eh, what was that?
Oh!  I'm all of a shake.  I though I heard somebody, but I suppose it was
nothing.  Oh dear, what a disagreeable affair this is; what an infernal fool 
I
am, to be sure.  Eh?  eh?"

     The hair on his head nearly stood up as he heard, or fancied he heard, 
a
low grown.  He shook so while he arose from his seat that he was glad to sit
down again as quickly as he possibly could, for he found his strength
evaporating along with the Dutch courage, or rather as it should be called,
French courage, that had been instilled into him by the brandy.

     "What shall I do," he gasped, "what shall I do?  Oh, what will become 
of
me?  I'm in for a row, I'm in for it to a certainty; I-- I think I'll call 
the
old man.["]

     He did not, however, call his father, whom he designated the old man,
more familiarly than respectfully, but as all continued now quiet, he 
thought
he would wait until the next alarm, at all events, before he made a piece of
work and thoroughly exhibited his own pusillanimity.

     "It may be nothing" he said, "after all, perhaps only the wind coming
through some chink in a door or window.  Lord bless us, I've read of such
things in romances till my blood had turned to curds and whey.  There was 
the
Bloody Spectre of the Tub of Blood, or the Smashed Gore.  Eh? eh?  I thought
somebody spoke.  No, no-- oh, its [sic] all what do they call it, 
imagination,
that's what it is, and the sooner I get the job over the better, so I'll 
just
pop on the cloak, and do the business."

     With trembling hands Mr. Lake junior drew the cloak from under the 
table
and put it on, bringing the collar of it right up to the top of his head, so
that but a small portion of his head was at all visible when he was thus
equipped, and he certainly might look like a vampyre, for he did not look 
like
anything human by any means.

     "Now, I wonder if she's asleep," he muttered as he laid his hand gently
on the lock of the door, "if she ain't, it would be a pity; but still I can
say, I only wanted to know how she was, so I'll just make the trial at all
events.  Here goes."

     He opened the door of the bedroom a very short distance, and said, --

     "Hist! hist! are you awake, eh? eh?  What did you say? -- nothing, oh,
she's asleep, and now here goes-- upon my life when one comes to think of 
it,
it ain't by any means a bad plan.  But just before I begin, I'll have 
another
drain," [sic]

     About two-thirds of a glass of brandy-and-water were in the tumbler on
the table, and that he tossed down at once, and feeling very much fortified 
by
laying in such a stratum of courage, he drew up the cloak to its proper
vampyre-like position, as he considered it, and advanced two steps within 
the
chamber of the sleeping girl.

     She was sleeping, and slightly moaning in her sleep.  It was a great
satisfaction to young master Lake, to hear her so moaning, for it convinced
him that such were the sounds which he previously heard, and which had gone
near to terrifying him out of his project.

     He had no compunction whatever regarding the amount of alarm which this
dastardly project was likely to give to Miss Lake.  No, all he looked to and
thought of was himself.  A light was burning in the chamber, and that
according to the directions of his father he blew out, and then groping his
ways towards the bed, he laid his hands upon the young girl's face, and 
said,
-- 

     "The vampyre! the vampyre has come! -- blood, blood, blood! -- the
vampyre!"

     She awoke with a cry of terror as usual, and then master Lake moved off
to the door, and said in his natural voice,

     "I'll protect you-- I'm coming-- I'll soon clear the room of the
vampyre.  Come on, you wretch!  Oh, I'll do for him.  Take that-- and that--
and that."

     Then he commenced kicking about the chairs, and nearly upset the
washing-stand, all by way of making the necessary disturbance, and 
convincing
his cousin what a sanguinary conflict he was having with the vampyre.  In 
the
midst of this something laid hold of him by the ears and whiskers on each 
side
of his head, and the door swinging open, his own light that was upon the 
table
in the corridor shone upon a hideous countenance within half an inch of his
own.  The long fang-like teeth of which, with the lips retracted from them,
were horrible to look upon, and a voice like the growl of an enraged hyena
said, --

     "What want you with the vampyre, rash fool?  He is here."

     Master Lake was absolutely petrified with horror and astonishment.  The
hair bristled up upon his head.  His eyes opened the width of saucers, and
when in a low voice the vampyre said again, -- "What want you, reptile, with
the vampyre?" he let his feet slide from under him, and had he not been 
upheld
by the horrible being who grasped him, he would have fallen.

     Bang went a pistol out of the corridor, and the vampyre uttered a cry 
and
let go his hold of Lake, who then fell, and being out of the way, showed his
father standing on the threshold of his own door, with a pistol in his hand
recently discharged, and another apparently ready.

     In another moment the vampyre kicked the insensible form of young Lake
out of the way, and shut himself in the girl's bedroom.  The father heard 
him
lock the door, and although he instantly sent another pistol shot through 
the
panelling, he heard no sound indicating its having done any execution.

     "Help, help, help," he cried, "help here.  The vampyre, the vampyre, 
the
vampyre!"

     All this had not taken above two or three minutes, and the whole house
was now alarmed by the sound of fire-arms, and as nobody had completely
undressed themselves to go to bed since the first alarm of the vampyre, the
landlord and several of the waiters, and the night watchman ran with all 
speed
to the spot, looking full of consternation, and all asking questions 
together.

     "Force the door, force the door," cried Mr. Lake, "a hammer, a hatchet,
anything, so that we may get the door forced; the vampyre is inside."

     "Oh lor!" cried one of the waiters who had gone close to the door, but
who now made a precipitate retreat, treading upon the stomach of young Lake 
as
he did so.

     "If you'll pay for the door, Sir," said the landlord, "I'll soon have 
it
open."

     "Damn it, I'll pay for twenty doors."

     The landlord took a short run at the door, probably he knew its 
weakness,
and burst it open at once.  There was the pause of about a moment, and then
Mr. Lake, snatching up the candle, the light of which had first revealed the
hideous features of the vampyre to his son, rushed into the room.

     In these cases all that is wanted is a leader, so he was promptly 
enough
followed.  The state of affairs was evident at a glance.  The young lady had
fainted, and the window was wide open, indicating the mode of retreat of the
vampire.

     "I thought you told us," said Mr. Lake "that this window was too far 
from
the ground to anticipate any danger from----"

     "Yes, so I did, sir.  But don't you see he could easy enough jump off 
the
sill on to those leads there.  Nobody could get in by the window, but 
anybody
that wasn't afraid could get out.  But we have him, sir, we have him now as
sure as a gun."

     "Have him.  How?"

     "Why don't you see sir, there's nothing but high walls.  He must be 
among
our stables, and he can't get out, for I have the keys of the outer doors
myself, we shall not lose him now, sir, I'm not a little thankful for it. 
Come on, everybody, round to the stables, and nothing now can prevent us
catching him if he is flesh and blood.  Come on, come on."

     By this time Mrs. Lake had reached the scene of action, and although 
the
first thing she did was to tumble, sprawling, over her hopeful son, who lay 
in
the door-way of his cousin's chamber, she gathered herself up again, and
remained in charge of Annette [sic] and the chamber, while Mr. Lake
accompanied the landlord and the waiters to the stables of the hotel, which
were surrounded by high walls and only to be approached by a pair of large
gates, which were quite satisfactorily fastened, and there was not a chink
large enough for a cat to get through.

     The landlord had the keys, and he opened a small wicket in one of the
large gates.

     "Now be careful," he said, "for fear he bounces out."

     At this everybody but Mr. Lake, who to do him but justice, had 
certainly
the quality of courage, looked as alarmed as possible, but he said, --

     "I have re-loaded my pistols, and he shall not escape me."

     The wicket was opened, and in an instant out walked Mr. Black!  He
appeared at first somewhat agitated, but speedily recovered his
self-possession, and looking at the group, he said, --

     "Have you caught him?  I have been upon the look out, notwithstanding 
my
indisposition, and jumped out of the bedroom window after him; I cannot see
him anywhere.  Have you caught him."

     "Yes," cried Mr. Lake, "I saw you in the room when I fired at you-- 
_you_
are the vampyre!["]

     He made a rush forward as he spoke, but Mr. Black got dexterously out 
of
the way, and seizing the landlord by the hair of the head he cast him so
fairly in Mr. Lake's way that they both fell down together; with amazing
rapidity the vampyre then fled from the spot.

     "After him, after him," cried Mr. Lake, as he scrambled to his feet,
"don't let him escape, after him, whatever you do; alarm the whole city,
rather than let the monster elude you.  This way-- this way, I see him. 
Follow me, a vampyre, a vampyre; help-- help, seize him, a vampyre!"

     "Fire," cried the landlord, and he too ran.

     But all the running was in vain, the vampyre had fairly got the start 
of
them, and he took good care to keep it, for with the most wonderful 
fleetness
he ran on, until, to his great relief, he found his pursuers were distanced.

     He made his way to the Strand, and diving down one of the narrow 
streets
terminated by the river, and at the end of which was a landing place, he
called aloud, --

     "Boat, boat!"

     An old waterman answered the hail.

     "Where to, your honour?"

     "Up the river, I will tell you where to land me, row quick, and row 
well,
and you may name your own fare, without a chance of its being questioned."

     "That's the customer for me," said the waterman.

 Next Time: The Plot Discovered. -- The Letter Left at the Hotel by the
 Vampyre.




                            CHAPTER CLXXIII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 191]

THE PLOT DISCOVERED. -- THE LETTER LEFT AT THE HOTEL BY THE VAMPYRE.


     The further pursuit of the vampyre was very soon given up by those who
had commenced it with, as they had vainly imagined such an assurance of
success.

     Probably with the exception of Mr. Lake himself none were really very
eager in it at all, and they were not sorry for a good excuse to drop it.

     There sat upon the countenance of Mr. Lake an appearance of great 
anger,
and when they got back to the hotel, he said to the landlord,

     "This is a very disagreeable affair, and I cannot think of remaining 
here
over to-morrow."

     "But sir, the vampyre has gone now!"

     "Yes, and may come again, for all I know."

     "Oh, dear me, surely not now, sir.  After what has happened, I should 
be
inclined to say that you will find this the quietest hotel in London."

     Mr. Lake would not be moved from his determination, however, and 
briefly
again announced that he would on the morrow remove.

     "How very vexatious," thought the landlord, but he could do nothing in
the matter.  His only hope, and that was a very slight one indeed, was, by 
the
morning the exasperated feelings of Mr. Lake would be somewhat assuaged, and
therefore, he thought it would be, at all events, a prudent thing to say no
more to him just then, when he was in such a mood.

     When Mr. Lake retired to his own apartment he was in anything but a 
pleasant frame of mind, for he found that things were not exactly turning 
out
as he wished, and he much feared that all his schemes would turn out 
abortive,
in which case they would recoil upon his own head in their consequences.

     It was quite by accident, that happening to cast his eyes upon the 
dressing-table, he saw a sealed letter lying there, and upon looking at the
superscription he was surprised to find that Annetta was the person for whom
it was intended.

     It was not, as the reader may suppose from what he knows of Mr. Lake,
from any honourables scruples that he hestitated at once to open the letter
addressed to his neice, but he was for a time considering whether he might
not, by doing so, be getting himself into some scrape from which he might
find it very difficult to extricate himself.

     "Who the deuce can it come from?" he said.

     He turned the epistle about in all directions, but such an inquiry did
not assist him, and finally he made up his mind that come what might, he 
would
break the seal and look at the contents.

     He soon, after coming to the determination, carried it into effect, and
to his surprise he found that the letter contained the following statement. 
--

     "To the lady Annetta Lake.

     "Fear nothing, lady.  He who disturbed your repose will disturb it no
longer.  Be happy, and do not let the dread of such another visitation ever
disturb your pure imaginings.  Your father will rescue you from your present
unhappy circumstances, and you will, likewise, soon see one who ere this 
would
have been with you, had he known of your being in London.

                                   "This comes from

                                   "VARNEY THE VAMPYRE.

     "If Mr. Lake, your bad uncle, upon whose dressing table this note is
placed, delivers it not to you, woe be to him, for I will make his nights
hideous with realities, and his days horrible with recollection and
anticipation."

     Mr. Lake was superstitious.  Are not the unprincipled always so?

     He read the postscript to the note with a shudder; and he felt that he
could no more muster courage enough to destroy the letter, than he could to
lay violent hands upon himself.  There he was with an epistle that he would
fain have kept from Annetta, and yet he dared not do so.

     "Confound my unlucky destiny," he said, "for bringing me to this hotel.
Perhaps if I had gone elsewhere, all this would not have happened.  Oh, if I
could but have suspected what this Mr. Black really was, I would have tried
some means for his extermination."

     He paced his chamber in an agitated manner until Mrs. Lake made her
appearance from the chamber of the lady Annetta, where she had been staying,
and to her then he at once communicated the letter that gave him so much
uneasiness.

     "I don't know what to do," he said, "or what to think."

     "Indeed!"

     "Yes, indeed.  Perhaps you can suggest something?"

     "And can you allow yourself to be made a slave of such fears.  There is
but one course to pursue, and that is, tomorrow to put the affair altogether
in a different shape, by overwhelming Annetta with the seeming evidence that
she is the daughter of an attorney's clerk, instead of her real father, Lord
Lake.  I know of no other way; and then when she finds such, as she will
think, to be the case, it's my opinion that she will no longer hesitate to
marry our son."

     "You thing so?"

     "Indeed do I, The girl is not an absolute fool surely."

     "Well, of course, I should be very glad if that darling project could 
be,
after all, brought about, but what is to be done with this letter?"

     "Can you ask?"

     "I do, when I consider the threat that is in it.  That threat, 
recollect,
is to me, and you can afford to think lightly of it.' [sic]

     "I will take the consequences.  It is hardly likely that you will be
punished for what you can't help.  I will take good care that this letter
never reaches Annetta, and as you have it not, why of course you cannot
deliver it, and so cannot be blamed."

     "But I might have it."

     "No such thing," said the lady snatching it up.  "You know me rather 
too
well, I should think, to hope that I would give it up to you, and as for 
your
taking it by force, I should think you knew me too well likewise to make 
such
a ridiculous attempt."

     "Well, then I wash my hands of it."

     "Ah! you may as well.  I don't know what has come over you of late, you
are as mean spirited as you can be, and formerly you used to be able to cope
with anything."

     "We never played for such a stake as we have now upon the board, and I
confess that I am rather nervous for the consequences."

     "Pshaw!  I see that I must guide you, or all will be lost.  To-morrow 
let
the whole affair be settled.  Let this attorney Miller, as you call him, 
come
here, and bring with him the person who is to claim Annetta as his own
daughter.  Let him have all the evidence that you tell me he has been so
ingenious in getting up, ready, in order that he may be in a position to
answer any questions."

     "Yes, yes."

     "And then, when all is settled, our son must come forward, and make a
speech, saying, he don't care a bit, who or what she is, that he loves her 
and
will make her his wife, although she has not a penny piece in the world."

     "I see, I see."

     "I think, from what I know of her, that such a course of proceeding 
will
have a great effect upon her."

     "Well, I hope so."

     "You hope so!  How despondingly you talk."

     "Why the honest truth--"

     "Good God! what do you mean by making use of such words, I never told 
the
honest truth in all my life; you may depend that won't do in this world, on
any consideration.  Never let me hear you say such a thing again, I beg of
you."

     "I was merely going to remark that this vampyre's business had really 
so
completely unsettled my whole nervous system, that I could not act with all
the tact and the determination that used to characterise my proceedings, and
for which you were ever disposed to give me so much credit.["]

     "Really."

     "Yes.  But I cannot regret such a state of things so much as I should
otherwise do, because I see that you are unmoved and as energetic as ever."

     "Well, well, say no more."

     "I am done."

     "I will prepare our boy for the part he is to act to-morrow; and mind, 
I
shall rely upon you to see your associates and get all the affair in train.
Let it be all over by twelve in the morning, so that if you like you can 
send
to Lord Lake where he is staying, at Florence still I presume, an account of
the matter by post that same night; only let me see the letter before you 
send
it."

     "I will, I will; you are my guardian angel."

     "Pho, pho; you are getting quite romantic and foolish; we have both 
made
up our minds to get money, and we have likewise known so much the want of 
it,
in abundance that is to say, that we have resolved to get it in any way we
can."

     "Yes, that I rather thing is our principle of action."

     "And has it not succeeded hitherto.  Have we not lived well without
troubling ourselves to earn the means by which we have done so.  Earn, 
indeed!
I leave that to a parcel of sleepy drones of people who have not the wit to
live upon others as we have; so now got to bed and sleep off some of the
unmanly fears that seem of late to be continually pressing upon you.  It is
well you have me to look after you as I do."

 Next Time: The Meeting in the Morning at the Hotel -- The Preparations of 
the
 Attorney.



                            CHAPTER CLXXIV. [sic]

                               [Chapter 192]

THE MEETING IN THE MORNING AT THE HOTEL -- THE PREPARATIONS OF THE ATTORNEY.


     It is no less than strange, the difference that takes place in people's
feelings with regard to precisely the same circumstances in the morning, 
from
what they really felt and thought in the evening, and when the shadows of
night were upon them.

     This mental phenomenon was not wanting in the case of Mr. Lake.

     He felt as he rose the next day, and the sun was shining in at the 
window
of his bedroom, most thoroughly ashamed of his fears and his nervous 
tremours
of the preceding night.

     His wife saw with a smile the change in his feelings.

     "You are no longer," she said, "afraid of the vampyre."

     "Oh, say no more about it," was his reply.  "I shall go immediately 
after
breakfast and see Mr. Miller, and with him make such arrangements as will
bring the affair upon which we have set our hearts to a crisis, and while I 
am
gone you can instruct our son in what he has to do."

     "I will."

     The breakfast passed over in rather a constrained manner.  Mrs. Lake 
had
made an attempt to persuade Annetta that she was really too unwell to get up
for an hour or two, but that Annette [sic] would not submit to, as she felt
herself, notwithstanding all her sufferings and all her fright, really 
capable
of rising.

     The consequence was, that she appeared at the breakfast table, and
stopped most effectually anything in the shape of a confidential discourse
taking place among the Lakes.

     The meal therefore passed off rather silently, and there were only a 
few
remarks made, incidentally, about the preceding night's alarm.

     Annetta was evidently in a state of great nervousness, as well she 
might
be, for the idea that she would be again subjected to the frightful visits 
of
the vampyre, was ever present to her, and she was denied the consolation 
which
the letter of Varney might, and most probably would have given her.

     After the morning meal, Mr. Lake gave his wife a significant look to
intimate that he was then going to Mr. Miller's, and that in his absence she
was to play her part.

     She perfectly understood him, and nodded in return, and thus this 
worthy
pair separated.

     We will follow Mr. Lake.

     The attorney did  not live in one of the most respectable haunts of the
profession, but he was a man of his word, and by the time Mr. Lake reached 
his
chambers he was there, it being then not much above ten o'clock.

     There was some delay in admitting Mr. Lake to the private room of the
attorney, and he thought that the clerk who was in the outer office looked a
little confused.

     "Is anybody with Mr. Miller?" asked Lake.

     "Yes-- that is to say-- I mean no."

     "A strange answer.  Yes, and you mean no."

     "Why, Sir, I only meant that Mr. Miller was rather busy, and we are so
much in the habit when that is the case, of saying that he has some one with
him that it slipped out unawares, only as we would not deceive you, sir, for
the world, you understand that that was why, you perceive, sir, that in a
manner of speaking, I corrected myself."

     This explanation was rather more wordy than satisfactory to Mr. Lake,
however, for want of a better, he was compelled to put up with it, and he 
said
nothing, but waited with the most exemplary patience, until Mr. Miller's 
bell
rang.

     The clerk answered it, and in a few moments returned to say that Mr.
Miller had got through a legal document he had been engaged upon, and the he
much regretted having kept Mr. Lake waiting, but was then quite at his
disposal.

     Now Lake could have sworn that he had heard the sound of a voice from 
the
private room of the attorney, and he consequently did not feel quite easy.

     When he went in he found Mr. Miller with a number of letters before 
him.

     "Ah, my dear sir," cried the lawyer, "sit down."

     "Thank you.  I thought somebody was with you?"

     "Oh, dear no, not at all.  I was going through a lease, you see, and 
from
long experience in such matters, I have found that I have a better and 
clearer
understanding of the matter, if I read it aloud to myself, but perhaps that 
is
only a peculiarity of mine."

     "Then it was your voice I heard just now?"

     Mr. Lake's suspicions were about half removed, certainly not more than
half, but he could say no more about it, although he cast now and then
suspicious glances round the room; yet if he had been asked what he was
suspicious of, he would hardly have been able to give a clear and
understandable answer to the question.

     It is one of the curses of conscious guilt ever to live in an 
atmosphere
of doubt and dread, and to the full did Mr. Lake feel that curse.

     "Well, Mr. Miller," he said, after a pause, "I have called upon you to
say that I hope it will suit your convenience to settle a little affair to-
day
at twelve o'clock at the hotel."

     "Twelve-- let me see-- twelve.  Not at the hotel my dear sir, I am
compelled to be in chambers in case of a letter coming on very particular
business, but if you will bring her here, I can manage it very nicely; if 
she
don't leave this place with a conviction that she has a father in London, 
I'll
eat my boots."

     "Well, I don't see why we should not come here, as you give me great
satisfaction Mr. Miller by avowing yourself to be so confident of the 
result."

     "I am as confident as that I sit on this three legged stool."

     "Good-- then you may depend upon our coming here at twelve o'clock
precisely.  There will be myself, Mrs. Lake, my son and the young lady.  
Mind
she is no fool, she must be perfectly overwhelmed with proofs of what we 
wish
to make her believe."

     "Exactly, that she is not the daughter of Lord Lake, but a mere 
changling
imposed upon him as his own child-- the said own child being dead."

     "Precisely."

     "Agreed, sir, agreed.  With respect to my reward, I have been thinking
that I should like, you know, to have some acknowledgment.  You tell me you
have no money now, but that this obstacle once removed you will come in for
all the Lake estates, and that Lord Lake cannot live long."

     "That's the state of the case."

     "Then sir, will you give me a note for [#]2000 [pounds], payable on
demand."

     "On demand?"

     "Yes; of course it would be needless folly of me to present it until 
you
have money you know."

     "True, true."

     We need not pursue the conversation further, but satisfy the reader by
stating the result, which was, that the attorney got the note for [#]2000
[pounds] form Lake, likewise a paper signed, which admitted the debt more
fully still, and effectually barred Lake from objecting to any proceedings 
on
account of want of consideration for the promissory note, or that it had not
been fairly obtained of him, pleas which might have inconvenienced Mr. 
Miller
if he chose to pursue Lake for the amount.

     In the meantime Mrs. Lake had not been idle, but had spoken to her 
booby
and cowardly son, making him aware of what he had to do in the business,
namely, to shew his great disinterestedness in taking for his wife Annetta
after she was supposed to be proved not the daughter of Lord Lake, but quite 
a
different personage, and altogether destitute of pecuniary resources.

     He managed pretty well always to understand any villany, and so entered
life and soul into the scheme of his mother.

     "Ah! I like that a monstrous deal better than keeping watch for a
vampyre, which is a sort of job that don't at all suit such a constitution 
as
mine, do you see?"

     Mrs. Lake not being aware of the alteration of arrangements by which 
they
were all to proceed to the lawyer's chambers, instead of coming to the 
hotel,
took no trouble with Annetta, conceiving that it would perhaps be better at
twelve o'clock, when the parties were assembled, to take her by surprise, 
than
to say anything to her beforehand, which might have the effect of preparing
her for what was to come, and so getting up a spirit of resistance and of
inquiry which it might be difficult to resist or satisfactorily to meet.

     When Mr. Lake came home from Gray's Inn, she was made aware of the
alteration, and consultations ensued as to how Annetta was to be got there 
at
all.  At length after several modes of managing the matter had been 
discussed,
Mrs. Lake said,

     "You two can walk there, and then I can say to Annetta that I am going
for a drive and to make a few purchases, so that she will have no objection 
to
go with me for an airing, and I will take good care to be with you at the 
hour
of twelve."

     "That will do prime," said the son.  "Leave mother alone for managing
things."

     "Well," said Mr. Lake, "it shall be so, I don't see any objection to 
the
scheme, nor can I suggest a better one, so we will look upon that as 
settled.
"All you have to do," turning to his son, "is to play your part well."

     "Oh! never fear me, I like the girl and I like money."

 Next Time: The Vampyre's Visit to the Barracks at Kingston. -- The Young
 Officer.




                            CHAPTER CLXXV. [sic]

                               [Chapter 193]

THE VAMPYRE'S VISIT TO THE BARRACKS AT KINGSTON. -- THE YOUNG OFFICER.


     We do not wish altogether to lose sight of Varney in these proceedings,
and it so happens that he is sufficiently mixed up in what further occurred 
to
make it desirable that we should now again refer to him.

     It was not the least singular fact in the character of that mysterious
being, to notice how he always endeavoured to make some sort of amends or
reparation to those whom he had so much terrified by his visitations.

     We have seen in the case of the family of the Bannerworths how 
eventually
he was most anxious to do them a service, as a recompense for the really
serious injury he had inflicted upon them, and how it was really and
eventually through him that they emerged from the circumstances of 
difficulty
and danger in which they had been pecuniarily engaged.

     We shall now see if Varney, who really in his way is a very respectable
sort of a personage, is about good or evil.

     We left him on the river, after promising in his usual liberal spirit, 
a
handsome reward to the waterman whom he employed to row the boat in which he
embarked.

     After going some distance, the waterman, finding his fare was silent,
thought it would be as well again to ask him where he was going.

     Accordingly, with a preparatory hem, he began by saying,

     "About as nice a tide, sir, as we could have for going up the stream."

     "Very likely," was the brief reply.

     "Do you land near hand, sir?"

     "I want to go to Kingston; take me to some Quay on the river as near as
you can, for the purpose of my walking there."

     "Kingston?" said the waterman, with a look rather of surprise.  "Its 
[sic]
a long pull to Kingston, and if your honour could get a conveyance, your 
best
way would be to get out at Putney."

     "Wherefore?"

     "Why after that, the river takes such a plaguy lot of windings and
turnings that you have to go treble the actual distance before you reach
Teddington.' [sic]

     "I said Kingston."

     "Well that's close by Teddington; but I'll row your honour if you like,
only it will take us some hours to get there that's all."

     "Go on."

     "Very good, pull away, pull a--way."

     Having now, as he knew, a long job before him, the waterman husbanded 
his
strength, he did not row near so fast, but to a low kind of tune he muttered
to himself he worked away at his sculls, slowly and surely, and got through
the water at a moderate easy rate, while rather a quick jerking one would 
soon
have exhausted him.

     The boat went slowly onward, and many an interesting sight was passed
upon the banks of the river, but none appeared in the least to attract the
attention of the man who sat in the boat, apparently deeply absorbed in his
own meditations.

     The boatman began much to wonder who he had got a a fare, and to think
that it would be but a dull and wearisome job to row all the way to 
Teddington
without any amusing gossip by the way, so he made yet another attempt to 
break
the stillness that reigned around.

     "The river up this way, sir," he said, "is quiet enough at night; it's
different below bridge though, for there there is always some bustle going
on."

     "Ah!" said Varney.

     "But here, somehow, it is dull to my mind."

     "Ah!"

     "Though the gentry and those as is book-learned find a deal of pleasure
in looking at the old places on the banks, where things have been done and
said by folks many a long year since, whose heads don't ache now, sir."

     "Ah!"

     There was no getting on at this rate, so, after two or three more 
remarks
and getting nothing by "Ah!" as a reply, the waterman gave it up as a bad 
job
altogether, and pulled away, chaunting in a low tone his song again, without
making another attempt to disturb the taciturnity of his fare, who sat as
still as a statue in the boat, and looking as if he did not breathe, so 
rigid
and strange were his attitude, and the lifeless-like appearance he had.

     The waterman was really a little alarmed by the time they reached
Teddington, for he thought that it might be possible his fare was dead, and
the horrid idea that he had stiffened in that attitude as he sat, began to
find a place in the boatman's imagination.

     When, however, he boat's keel grated on the landing-place, he cried, --

     "Here we are, your honour."

     The vampyre rose and stepped on shore.  He held out his hand and 
dropped
a guinea into the extended palm of the waterman, and then stalked off.

     After he had walked some distance he spoke to a watchman whom he met,
saying, --

     "Are there not military barracks somewhere hereabout?"

     "Oh, yes."

     "Thank you.  Can you direct me?"

     "Certainly.  You have only to go on, and take the second turning to 
your
left, and you will see the gate; it's horse soldiers that's there now-- the
4th Light Dragoons."

     By keeping to the directions which the watchman had given, Varney soon
reached the gate of the barracks, and then it was three o'clock in the
morning.  A sentinel was pacing to and fro at the gate.  To him Varney at
once went, and with a lofty kind of courtesy, that made the man at once
respectful to him, he said, --

     "Is Lieutenant Rankin in barracks?"

     "Yes, sir, -- on duty."

     "Indeed!  Is he on guard to-night?"

     "Yes, sir, to four o'clock.  He will be relieved then."

     "That's fortunate, I want to see him.  It is on business of the very
first importance, or of course I would not trouble him or myself.  You must
send to him somehow."

     The sentinel hesitated.

     "I hardly know," he said, "how the lieutenant will take it-- he is on
duty."

     "But I suppose he is human for all that, and is liable to all the
accidents and alternations of human affairs, which may make it absolutely
necessary he should be communicated with, even at such an hour as this.  I
will hold you harmless."

     This was so reasonable, and there was such an air of quiet gentlemanly
authority about Varney, that the soldier began to think he should run less
risk of offending somebody of importance if he consented to disturb the
lieutenant than if he refused.  Accordingly he stepped a pace or two within
the gate and called out.

     "Guard!"

     A soldier from the guard-room answered the summons.

     "Ay," he said, "what is it? -- a strange cat I suppose."

     "No, none of your nonsense.  Here is a gentleman, I think a general
officer, by Jove, wants to see Lieutenant Rankin.  Go and tell him."

     "And give him this," said Varney, as he handed the soldier a card, on
which was written, --

     "A friend to a friend of Lieutenant Ranking, whose initials are A. L."

     "I know that this young soldier loves the Lady Annetta," muttered the
vampyre to himself, "and he shall be given the opportunity of flying to her
rescue from her villanous relations.  So far, I will make reparation to 
her."

     In less than three minutes, Lieutenant Rankin came hurriedly to the
gate.

     "Where is the gentleman?" he said.

     "Here sir," said Varney, "step aside with me."

     The young officer did so, and then Varney said to him, --

     "It matters not how I became acquainted with the fact, but I know that
you love the Lady Annetta Lake, and that you are far from being 
indifferently
regarded by her.  She is in London at the London Hotel.  A vile plot is 
formed
to marry her to her cousin, the gist of which is to make her both her and 
her
father believe that she is a  changeling and not the daughter of Lord Lake.
You love her, young man.  Go and rescue her."

     "Annetta in London!"

     "Yes, what I tell you you may rely upon, as if it were a voice from
heaven that spoke to you.  Go and snatch her whom you love from the base 
hands
of those who, under the mask of pretended friendship, would betray her."

     "And you," cried the young soldier; "who are you, and how can I repay 
you
for bringing me this intelligence of her whom I [--"]

     "Enough," said the vampyre.  "I have performed my mission.  It is for
you, young sir, to take a due advantage of that which I have told to you."

     In another moment he was gone.

 Next Time: An Eclaircissement. -- The Innocent Triumphant.




                            CHAPTER CLXXVI. [sic]

                               [Chapter 194]

AN ECLAIRCISSEMENT. -- THE INNOCENT TRIUMPHANT.


     It is eleven o'clock, Mr. and Mrs. Lake are standing by one of the
windows at the hotel conversing in whispers, while the hopeful son is 
brushing
his hat.

     "It is time, you think?" said Mrs. Lake.

     "Yes," was the reply. "and I will be off now at once, and depend upon 
you
following with Annetta to Mr. Miller's."

     "That you may be sure of.  She has had a refreshing night's rest, and
this morning she eagerly enough caught at the proposal to take a drive round
the principal thoroughfares in the carriage we have hired so that that [sic]
is no longer a difficulty."

     "What is to be done if she rejects?"

     Mr. Lake gave a jerk with his head in the direction of his son, to
signify that it was of him he talked.

     "It can't be helped if she does.  Then I should say all we have to do, 
is
to persevere in making her out no child of Lord Lakes [sic], and wait for 
his
decease.  We must be careful what we are about, though, or he may take it 
into
his head to make some ample provision for her, to the decrease of his 
personal
means, which I hope to see all ours."

     The only way to stop that will be getting Miller and the pretended 
father
to make it as a complete part of the plan that Annetta herself should seem
latterly to have been a party to palming herself off upon him as his 
daughter
when she knew the contrary quite well."

     "Ah, if that could be done."

     "It must and shall; Miller's ingenuity in such matters is immense.  He
will accomplish anything in the world-- aye seeming impossibilities-- for
money."

     "He is just the man for us, so now be off with you at once, and expect 
me
in good time."

     In a few moments afterwards, Mr. Lake set off with this booby son to 
the
lawyers,' [sic] enjoining him all the way as they went, to be especially
careful how he maintained the character of a disinterested suitor, which had
been marked out for him in the programme of the family proceedings.

     "Oh, never fear me, father."

     "Well, I hope that you will do and say the right things, and what is as
important, I hope you will do and say them at the right time, otherwise you
will spoil all."

     Thus armed at all points, as they thought, for conquest, old Lake and
young Lake, than whom all London could not have produced two more 
unprincipled
persons, arrived at Gray's Inn, and were received in the outer room of Mr.
Miller's chambers with every demonstration of respect.

     "Walk in, gentlemen, walk in to the clients' private-room if you 
please,"
said the clerk.  "Mr. Miller left directions with me that when you came, you
should be shown in at once."

     All this was very gratifying indeed, and the solicitor was there, 
seated
in his easy chair, looking as full of serenity as possible, and as if the
least affair in the world was on _tapis_.

     Scarcely had the usual salutations passed, when the clerk announced 
Mrs.
Lake and a young lady.

     "My wife with Annetta!" exclaimed Lake; and in a moment his words were
verified by the appearance of the parties he had named.

     "Tell me at once," said Annetta, "why I am brought here?"

     "My dear young lady," said Mr. Miller, "if you will condescend to take 
a
seat, I will explain."

     "Be brief, sir."

     The party was seated, and then Mr. Miller, clearing his throat said, --

     "Ahem!  You are of course aware, miss, that great doubt arose in the 
mind
of Lord Lake with regard to your proper identity, and he sent you over to 
this
country from Italy with his brother and family, to have those doubts 
resolved-- ahem!  They are resolved, and you are found to be the daughter of 
a
gentleman now in London."

     "The proofs, sir," said Annetta, with a dignity and a calmness that
surprised the whole party.

     "Ah, ah-- the proofs.  Let me see, oh yes; there are the papers.  No. 
1,
copy of a confession made by---"

     "Stop, sir," said young Lake, "stop.  This is-- it must be painful to 
the
feelings of this young lady, and very, very painful is it to my feelings, 
for
I have been long fervently attached to her, and let her be whose daughter 
she
may, she is to me all perfection.  I love her and would gladly make her my
wife, let her be named whatever she may."

     "But she is destitute, -- quite destitute," said Miller.

     "It don't matter to me," cried young Lake -- he was playing his part
famously -- "it don't matter to me; I love her, and will work for her-- she
shall never want while I have life-blood in my veins."

     "If this now were sincere," said Annetta, "I should begin for the first
time to respect you.  But you will excuse me for doubting it very much.  I
likewise doubt much the pretended evidence that you bring forward regarding 
my
birth."

     A tremendous knock at the outer door of the chambers now disturbed the
party.  An altercation was heard with the clerk -- then a shout for police,
and a heavy fall as if somebody had been knocked down, and in another moment
the door of Mr. Miller's private room was dashed open, and Lieutenant 
Rankin,
in his undress military uniform, stood upon the threshold.

     "Annetta!" he cried.

     "Rankin-- oh, George, George!" shrieked Annetta, and in another moment
she was in his arms.

     "Here's a go," cried young Lake; "I say, young fellow, this won't do."

     "Oh, George, George!" said Annetta, "they will have it that I am not my
own father's child, that I am some nameless, houseless thing."

     "They lie, Annetta who say so," replied the young soldier; "you shall 
be
mine, and the proudest that ever stepped shall treat you with becoming
respect, or shall rue the consequences."

     "Well, I think it's time!" cried Mr. Miller in a marked manner, and
throwing open the door of an inner room, he added, "my Lord Lake, come 
forth;
no doubt you have heard all."  Lord Lake himself-- the Mr. Blue of the 
London
Hotel, the sham confidential clerk of Miller-- made his appearance, to the
utter confusion of the Lakes.

     "My father," said Annetta, "my dear father!"

     "Hold," said Lord Lake, gravely, "I suspected, Annetta, from the first
that your birth was impugned by my brother from the most interested motives,
and I followed you from Italy-- Mr. Miller disclosed all to me, and the
infamous plot is discovered."

     "Then I am your child?"

     "Confusion," muttered Lake, "death and the devil, what a _contre 
temps_."

     "Stop," added Lord Lake, "the strangest thing of all has yet to be 
told.
This plot to make out that you are not my child is but a plot, but it is not
baseless as to the fact.  You are not my daughter.  I have by mere chance
found out that lately, and I cannot provide for you, as the resources I have
must go to him who will inherit my title.  What say you, Master Lake, this
girl with all her beauty is destitute, her name is Smith-- will you have 
her?"

     "Not I in faith, thank you for nothing."

     "Will you, young soldier, knowing what she is?"

     "Ay, will I with all my heart! she is the highest, brightest treasure
this world can offer me.  Any name or no name-- poor or rich-- noble or
commoner-- she is still my own dear girl, and her resting place shall be my
heart, the whole world shall not tear her from it."

     "God's blessings on you," cried Lord Lake, grasping his hands; "I did 
but
this to give yon shrinking coward a chance of creeping into favour with me,
because he boasted so of his disinterested affection a while ago.  She is my
child, the Lady Annetta Lake-- I never doubted it, and she is yours-- George
Rankin, and you shall be the dear son of my adoption."

     "I say, father," said young Lake, "I-- I think we had better go."

     "Curse you all," cried Lake, "and doubly curse you, lawyer Miller, you
have betrayed me; but I'll be revenged."

     "Through the bars of a prison," said the lawyer.  "An officer is down
stairs to arrest you for two thousand pounds.  Ha, ha, ha!"

              *               *               *               *

     Thus then was it that this episode in the life of Varney the Vampyre
terminated.  But still he lived, and still there existed all the strange and
fearful mixture of good and evil that was in his disposition.  There he was
yet upon the earth's surface, looking like one of the great world, and yet
possessing so few feelings in common with its inhabitants.

     Surely to him there must have been periods of acute suffering, of 
intense
misery, such as would have sufficed to drive any ordinary mind to 
distraction,
and yet he lived, although one cannot, upon reviewing his career, and
considering what he was, consider that death would have been other than a
grateful release to him from intense suffering.

     Perhaps, of all the suffering that, in consequence of his most awful 
and
singular existence, was inflicted upon human nature, he suffered the most, 
for
that he was a man of good intellect no one who has followed us thus far can
doubt, and one cannot help giving in almost at times to as strange and
fanciful theory of his own, namely that this world was to him the place of
perdition for crimes done in some other sphere.

     "It must be so!" he would say, "but as the Almighty Master of all 
things
is all merciful, as he is all powerful, the period of my redemption will
surely come at last."

     This was the most consolat thought that Varney could have, and it 
showed
that even yet there was a something akin to humanity lingering at his hears.
[bears? heart?]

     This showed that despite the dreadful power he had -- a power, as well 
as
an awful propensity -- he had some yearnings after a better state.

     What had he been?  How did he become a vampyre?  Did the voice of fond
affection ever thrill in his ears?  Had little children ever climbed the 
knee
of that wretched man?  Fearful questions, if he could have answered them the
affirmative -- if he bore about with him, deep in his memory, a remembrance 
of
such joys gone by.

 Next Time: The Vampyre Has Serious Thoughts. -- The Dream. -- The 
Resolution.




                            CHAPTER CLXXVIII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 195]

THE VAMPYRE HAS SERIOUS THOUGHTS. -- THE DREAM. -- THE RESOLUTION.


     The next day after the events that we have detailed, Varney found 
himself
in a hotel in London.  He did not even make the effort to inquire how the
affair connected with the Lady Annetta, in which towards the last he had
played a generous part, prospered.

     He was too spirit-broken himself to do so.

     For nearly the whole day he remained in a room by himself, and although
to avoid uncomfortable and ungracious remarks being made by the people of 
the
house, he ordered from time to time food and wine, he, in accordance with 
his
horrible nature, which forbade him any nourishment but human blood, touched
neither.

     During that day he seemed to be suffering acutely, for now and then as
the waiters of the hotel passed the door of the private room he occupied, 
they
heard deep agonising groans, and when once or twice they went in, fancying
that he must be very ill or dying, they found him seated at a table on which
his head was resting.

     He would start up on these occasions, and sternly question them for
interrupting him, so at last they left him alone.

     Let us look at him in his solitude.

     It is getting towards the dim and dusky hours of late twilight, and he
can only barely be descried [sic] as he sits bolt upright in a high-backed
arm-chair, looking at vacancy, while his lips move, and he appears to be
conversing with the spirits of another world, that in their dim 
untangibility
are not visible to mortal eyes.

     Now and then he would strike his breast, and utter a dull groan as if
some sudden recollection of the dreadful past had come over him, with such a
full tide of horror that it could not be resisted.

     It was not until a considerable time had elapsed, and the darkness had
greatly increased, that he at length spoke.

     "And I was once happy," he daisie mournfully, "once happy, because I 
was
innocent.  Oh! gracious Heaven, how long am I to suffer?"

     A spasmodic kind of movement of his whole features ensued, that was 
quite
dreadful to look upon, and would have terrified any one who could have seen
them.  Then he spoke again.

     "I was happy one hundred and eighty years ago," he said, "for that has
been the awful duration my life as yet; yes, a hundred and eighty years 
have,
with their sunshine of summer, and their winter storms, passed over my head;
and I had a wife and children, who, with innocent and gladsome prattle, 
would
climb my knee and nestle in my bosom.  Oh! where are they all now?"

     He wrung his hands, but he did not weep the fount of tears had dried up
for a hundred years in his bosom.

     "Yes, yes! the grave holds them-- holds them? said I.  No, no, long 
since
have they crumbled into dust, and nothing of them remains as a faint
indication even of who once was human.  I, I it was who listened to the
councils of a fiend, and destroyed he [her?] who had give up home, kindred,
associations, all for me."

     He rose up from the chair, and seemed to think that he would find some
relief in pacing the room to and fro, but he soon threw himself again into 
the
seat.

     "No, no," he said, "no peace for me; and I cannot sleep, I have never
slept what mortals call sleep, the sleep of rest and freedom from care, 
[f]or
many a long year.  When I do seen [seem?] to repose, then what dreadful 
images
awake to my senses.  Better, far better than my glaring eyeballs should 
crack
with weariness, than that I should taste such repose."

     The sympathetic shudder with which he uttered these words was quite 
proof
sufficient of his deep and earnest sincerity.  He must indeed have suffered
much before he could have give such a sentiment such an utterance.  We pity
thee, Varney!

     "And when, oh, when will my weary pilgimage be over," he ejaculated; 
"Oh
when will the crime of murder be cleansed from my soul.  I killed her.  Yes, 
I
killed her who loved me.  A fiend, I know it was a fiend, whispered 
suspicion
in my ear, suspicion of her who was as pure as the first ray of sunlight 
that
from heaven shows itself to chase away the night, but I listened and then
created from my own fevered brain the circumstances that gave suspicion
strength and horrible consistency-- and I killed her."

     After the utterance of these words he was silent for a time, and then 
in
heart-rending accents he again repeated them.

     "I killed her-- I killed her, and she was innocent.  Then I became what 
I
am.  There was a period of madness, I think, but I became a vampyre; I have
died many deaths, but recovered from them all; for ever, by some strange
accident or combination of circumstances, the cold moonbeams have had access
to my lifeless form, and I have recovered."

     By this time the landlord of the hotel in which Varney was staying, had
got in a fearful fidget, for he began to think that he had a madman in his
house, and that it would turn out that his guest had made his escape from 
some
lunatic asylum.

     "I wonder now," he thought, "if a little soothing civility would do any
good; I will try it.  It can't surely do any harm."     

     With this intent the landlord went up stairs to the room in which 
Varney
the Vampyre was, and he tapped gently at the door.

     There was no reply, and after a few moments' consideration, the 
landlord
opened the door and peeped in, when he saw his customer sitting in an
arm-chair, in the manner in which we have described him to sit.

     "If you please, sir," said the landlord, "would you not like----"

     "Blood!" said Varney, rising.

     The landlord did not wait for any more, but bustled down stairs again
with all the promptitude in his power.

     It was a bed-room and sitting-room that Varney occupied at the hotel, 
the
one adjoining the other, and now although he groaned and sighed at the idea 
of
repose, he flung himself upon the bed, full dressed, as he was, and there he
lay as still as death itself.

     One of those strange fitful kind of slumbers, such as he had himself
described as being so full of dread, came over him.

     For a time he was still, as we have said, but then as various images of
agony began to chase each other through his brain, he tossed about his arms,
and more than once the word "mercy" came from his lips in accents of the 
most
soul-harrowing nature.

     This state of things continued for some considerable time, and then in
his sleep a great change came over him, and he fancied he was walking in a
garden replete with all the varied beauties of a southern clime, and through
the centre of which meandered a stream, the chrystal music of which was
delightfully calming and soothing to his senses.

     All around seemed to speak of the peace and loveliness of an Eden.

     As he wandered on, he fancied that some form was walking by his side, 
and
that he heard the gentle fall of its feet, and the flutter of garments.

     "Varney," it said, "you have suffered much."

     "I have.  Oh, God knows I have."

     "You would die, Varney, if the moonbeams could be prevented from 
reaching
you."

     "Yes, yes.  But how-- how?"

     "The ocean.  The deep, deep sea hides many a worse secret than the 
corpse
of a vampyre."

     It might have been that, after all, his sleep was to some extent
refreshing to him, or that the dream he had, had instilled a hope into him 
of
a release from what, in his case, might truly be called the bondage of
existence; but he certainly arose more calm, cool, and collected, than he 
had
been for some time past.

     "Yes," he said, "the deep sea holds a secret well, and if I could but 
be
washed into some of its caverns, I might lie there and rot until the great
world itself had run its course."

     This idea took great possession of him.  He thought over various modes 
of
carrying it out.  At one time he thought that if he bought a boat on the sea
coast, and went out alone, sailing away as far from land as he could, he 
might
be able to accomplish his object.  But then he might not be able to get far
enough.

     At length he thought of a more feasible and a better plan than that, 
and
it was to take his passage in some ship for any port, and watch his
opportunity, some night when far from land, to steal up upon the deck and
plunge in the waves.

     The more he considered of this plan the better he liked it, and the 
more
it wore an appearance of probability and an aspect of success, so at length
the thought grew into a resolution.

     "Yes, yes," he muttered, "who knows but that some friendly spirit-- for
the mid air that floats 'twixt earth and heaven is peopled with such, may 
have
whispered such counsel in my ears.  It shall be done; I will no longer
hesitate, but make this attempt to shake off the dreadful weight which mere
existence is to me."

 Next Time: The Scotch Packet Ship. -- The Suicide.




                            CHAPTER CLXXIX. [sic]

                               [Chapter 196]

THE SCOTCH PACKET SHIP. -- THE SUICIDE.


     It was in pursuance of this resolution, so strangely and suddenly 
formed,
that the unhappy Varney rose on the following morning and went to that 
region
of pitch, slop clothing, red herrings, and dirt-- the docks.

     But yet, somehow, although the docks may not be the cleanest or them 
most
refined part of the vast city of London, the coarseness and the litter there
-- for after all it is more litter than dirt -- are by no means so repulsive
as those bad addenda to other localities.

     There is a kind of rough freshness induced by the proximity of the 
water
which has a physical and moral effect, we are inclined to think, upon the
place and the people, and which takes off much of what would otherwise wear
the aspect of what is called low life.

     But this is all by the way, and we will at once proceed to follow the
fortunes of Varney, in carrying out his plan of self annihilation.

     The hour was an early one, and many a curious glance was cast at him, 
for
although he had humanised and modernised his apparel to a great extent, he
could not get rid of the strange, unworld-like (if we may use the phrase) 
look
of his face.  He was very pale too, and jaded looking, for the thoughts that
had recently occupied him were not such as to do good to the looks of any 
one.

     He cared little in what vessel he embarked.  He had but one object in
embarking at all, and that was to get out to sea, so that the ultimate
destination of the ship that should receive so very odd and equivocal a
passenger was a matter of no moment.

     Stopping a personage who had about him a sea-faring look, Varney,
pointing to a bustling place of embarkation, said, --

     "Does any vessel start from there today?"

     "Yes, there's one going now, or as soon as the tide serves her.  She is
for Leith?"

     "On the coast of Scotland, I think?"

     "Yes, to be sure."

     Varney walked on until he came to a kind of counting-house, where sat a
man with books before him, and, not to take up more valuable space, he 
secured
what was called a berth on board the "Ocean", a dirty, small, ill-convenient
ship bound for the port near the Scotch metropolis of Edinburgh.

     Not wishing to be himself much noticed, and having no desire to notice
anybody, Varney went down below, and seated himself in a dark corner of the
generally dingy cabin, and there, amid all the noise, bawling, abuse, and
bustle contingent upon getting the ill-conditioned bark under weigh, he 
never
moved or uttered a word to any one, although the cabin was frequently 
visited.

     But Varney had no idea of the amount of annoyance to which he was 
likely,
in the course of the evening, to be subjected.

     The vessel was got under weigh, and as both wind and tide happened to 
be
favourable, she dropped down the river rapidly, and soon was clear of the
Nore-light, and holding on her course northward.

     The cabin now began to fill with the passengers, and extraordinary as 
the
fact may appear, there were many Scotchmen actually going back again.  They
were, however, only going to pay visits, for it is one of the popular
delusions that Scotchmen try to keep up in this country, that they have left
something dear and delightful behind them in Scotland, and that, take it
altogether, it is one of the most desirable spots in the whole world.  It
becomes, therefore, quite necessary for them to go back now and then, in 
order
to keep up that delusion.

     Personal vanity, too, is one of the great characteristics of the 
nation;
and many a Scotchman goes back to Edinburgh, for example, to make an
appearance among his old friends and family connexions, totally incompatible
with his real position in London.

     By about nine o'clock at night, when the shore to the west could only 
be
discovered as a dim, grey line on the horizon, the cabin of the "Ocean" 
packet
was crammed.

     Whisky was produced, and a drink that the Scotch call "bottled yell,"
meaning ale; and as these two heady liquids began to take effect "Auld Lang
syne" was chaunted in the vernacular by the whole party.  At length a 
feeling
of annoyance began to grow up from the fact of the isolated aspect of 
Varney,
and the quiet, unobtrusive manner in which he looked on at the proceedings,
appearing not in the smallest degree enthusiastic, even when the most
uproarious Scotch songs, in the most unintelligible of all jargons, were 
sung,
for strange to say, the authors of that nation take a pride in slaughtering
the English language.

     At length a Scotchman approached Varney and said, --

     "Ye'll take a glass to auld Reekie mon?"

     [Edinburgh is called Reekie in consequence of the absence of drainage,
giving it a horrible foetid smell, a reeky atmosphere, in a manner of
speaking; which may be illustrated by the Scotchman, who was returning to 
that
place from England, on the top of a stage coach, when within about fifty 
miles
he began sniffing and working his nose in an extraordinary manner.

     "What are you doing that for?" said an Englishman. "Eh! mon, I can 
smell
the gude auld toon."

     "I do not understand your language," said Varney, and he walked from 
the
cabin to the deck of the vessel.  He recoiled an instant, for the moon was
rising.

     "Ever thus, even thus," he said, "how strange it is that I never dream 
of
ridding myself of the suffering of living, ut the moon is shining brightly.
Can its rays penetrate the ocean?"

     The deck was very still and silent indeed.  The man at the helm, and 
one
other pacing to and fro, were all that occupied it, save Varney himself, and
he stood by the side gazing in the direction, where he had last seen the dim
grey speck of land.

     "A pleasant run, sir, we shall have of it," said the man who had been
pacing the deck, "if this kindly wind continues."

     "It blows from the west."

     "Yes, nearly due-west; but that suits us.  We keep her head a few 
points
in shore, and do well with such a wind, although a south-west by south is 
our
choice."

     "How far are we from land?"

     "It's the coast of Suffolk that is to our left, but we are I hope a 
good
thirty miles or more from it."

     "You hope?"

     "Yes, sir.  Perhaps you are not sufficient of a sailor to know that we
never hug the shore if we can possibly help it."

     "I understand.  And there?"

     "Oh, there lies the German Ocean."

     "How deep now should you say the sea was here?"

     "Can't say, sir, but it's blue water."

     This was not much information to Varney, but he bowed his head and 
walked
forward, as much as to say that he had had enough of the information and
conversation of the man, who was the mate of the vessel, and quite disposed 
to
be communicative.  Perhaps in the very dim light he did not see exactly what 
a
strange-looking personage he was talking to.

     "Thirty miles from land," thought Varney, "surely that is far enough, 
and
I need have no dread of floating to the shore through such a mass of water 
as
that thirty miles.  The distance is very great; I can to-night in another
hour make the attempt."

     To his great joy some heavy clouds climbed up the sky along with the
moon, and congregating around the beautiful satellite, effectually obscured
the greater number of its beams.  There was in fact, no absolute moonlight,
but a soft reflected kind of twilight coming through the clouds, and 
dispersed
far and wide.

     "This will do," muttered Varney.  "All I have to fear are the direct
moonbeams.  It is they that have the effect of revivfying such as I am."

     The man who had been pacing the deck finally sat down, and appeared to
drop off to sleep, so that all was still, and as Varney kept to the head of
the vessel, the man at the wheel could see nothing of him, there being many
intervening obstacles.  He was perfectly alone.

     Now and then, with a loud roaring about, he heard some boisterous
drinking chorus come from the cabin, and then a rattle of glasses as fists
were thumped upon the tables in token of boisterous approbation, and then 
all
would be still again.

     Varney looked up to the sky and his lips moved, but he uttered no 
sound.
He went closer to the vessel's side and gazed upon th water as it lazily
rippled past.  How calm and peaceful, he thought, he ought to be, far 
beneath
that tide.

     A sudden plunge into the sea would have made a splash that would have
been heard, and that he wished of all things to avoid.  He clambered slowly
over the side, and only held on by his hands for a moment.

[????]
cool night air tossed about his long elfin locks, and in another moment he
was gone.

 Next Time: The Old Manor House. -- The Rescue. -- Varney's Despair.




                            CHAPTER CLXXX. [sic]

                               [Chapter 197]

THE OLD MANOR HOUSE. -- THE RESCUE. -- VARNEY'S DESPAIR.


     At about ten o'clock on that same night on which Varney the Vampyre
plunged into the sea with hopes of getting rid of the world of troubles that
oppressed him, a small fishing boat might have been seen a distance of about
twenty-five miles from the Suffolk coast, trying to make for land, and 
baffled
continually by the wind that blew off shore.

     In this boat were two young men, and from their appearance they 
evidently
belonged to the wealthier class of society.  They were brothers.

     From their conversation we shall gather the circumstances that threw 
them
into such situation, not by any means divested of peril as it was.

     "Well, Edwin," said one, "here we have been beating about for five 
hours,
trying to get in shore, and all our little bark permits us to do is I think
not materially to increase our distance from home."

     "That is about the truth, Charles," said the other, "and it was my
fault."

     "Come, Edwin, don't talk in that way.  There is no fault in the matter;
how could you know that the wind would stiffen into such a breeze as it has,
so that we cannot fight out against it; or if there be fault, of course it's
as much mine as yours, for am not I here, and do I not know full well what 
an
amount of consternation there will be at the Grange?"

     "There will indeed!"

     "Well, their joy when we get back will be all the greater."

     "Shall we get back?"

     "Can you ask?  Look at our little boat, is she not sea-worthy?  Does 
she
not dance on the waves merrily?  It is only the wind after all that baffles
us, if it would drop a little, we could, I think make head against it with 
the
oars.

     The brothers were silent now for a few moments, for they were each
looking at the weather.  At length Edwin spoke, saying, --

     "We shall have the moon up, and that may make a change."

     "Very likely-- very likely.  There is not, I think, quite so much sea 
as
there was; suppose we try the oars again?"

     The other assented, and the two young men exerted themselves very much 
to
decrease their distance from the Suffolk coast by pulling away right 
manfully,
but it was quite evident to them that they did no good, and that they had 
just
as well dropped westward as they had been doing, by keeping the sail set, 
and
steering as near as possible to the wind.

     "Why, if this goes on, Charles, where shall we get to by the morning?"

     "To Northumberland, perhaps."

     "Or further."

     "Well, if we go far enough, what say you to attempting the _vexata
questio_ of the north-west passage?"

     "Nay, I cannot jest-- it's a sad thing this-- more sad a good deal for
those who are at home, than for us.  To-morrow is Clara's wedding day, and
what a damper it will be upon all to suppose that we have perished at sea."

     "They will never suppose that we would do anything so ridiculous.  Why,
at the worst, you know, we could go before the wind and run on to Holland."

     "Yes, if no storm arises or such a gale as might founder our boat.
There, there is the moon."

     "Yes, and she will soon be overtaken by yon bank of clouds that seem to
be scudding after her in the blue heavens.  Ha! a sail, by Jove!"

     "Where? where?"

     "Not I think above four miles there to the east, by our little compass
which it is a thousand mercies we have with us.  Look, you may see her sails
against that light cloud-- there."

     "I see her.  Think you she will see us?"

     "There is every chance, for her swell of canvass will be all the other
way.  Fire your fowling-piece and the sound may reach her, the wind is good
for carrying it."

     Charles took a fowling-piece from the bottom of the boat.  The brothers
had merely gone out at sunset or a little before it, to shoot gulls, and he
tried to discharge the piece, but several seas that they had shipped, while
they were thinking of other things than keeping the gun dry, had, for the 
time
being, most effectively prevented it from being discharged.

     "Ah!" said Edwin as he heard the click of the lock, "that hope is 
lost."

     "It is indeed, and to my thinking the ship is distancing us rapidly.  
You
see our mast and sail, will, at even this distance, lie so low in the 
horizon
that they will hardly see us unless they are sweeping the sky with a night
glass."

     "And that is not likely."

     "Certainly not, so we have nothing for it but to hold on our way.  I am
getting hungry if you are not."

     "I certainly am not getting hungry, for I have felt half famished these
last two hours; but I suppose we may hold out against the fiend hunger some
hours yet.  What are you looking at so earnestly, eh?"

     "I hardly know."

     "You hardly know?  Let me see-- why-- why what is it?"

     "There seems to me to be something now and that much darker than the
waves, tiding on their tops; there, do you not see it?  There it is again.
There!"

     "Yes, yes."

     "What on earth can it be?"

     "A dead body."

     "Indeed! ah! it drifts towards us.  There is some current hereabouts, 
for
you see it comes to us against the wind."

     "Dont [sic] deceive yourself, brother.  It is we who are going with the
wind towards it, and now you can see there is no doubt about what it is.  
Some
poor fellow, who has been drowned.  Get out the boat-hook, get it out."

     "Why, you would not take in such a cargo, Edwin."

     "God forbid! but I feel some curiosity to see who and what sort of a
personage it is.  Here we have him.  What a length he is to be sure."

     The body was nearly alongside the boat, and one of the brothers 
detained
it with a boat-hook, while they both looked earnestly at it.

     It was the body of a man, remarkably well dressed, and had no 
appearance
of having been under the water long.  The features, as far as they could see
them, were calm and composed.  The hands were clenched, and some costly
looking rings glittered on the fingers through the salt spray that foamed 
and
curled around the insensible form.

     "Charles," said Edwin; "what we shall do?"

     Edwin shook his head.

     "I-- I don't like."

     "Like what?"

     "I don't like to cast it adrift again, and not take it ashore, where it
can rest in an honest man's grown if he be one.  Fancy it being one of us,
would it not be a consolation to those who love us to know that we rested in
peace among our ancestors, in preference to rotting in the sea, tossed and
mangled by every storm that blows.  I do not like to cast the body adrift
again."

     "It's a ghastly passenger."

     "It is, but that ghastliness is only an idea, and we should remember 
that
we ourselves----"

     "Stop, brother, stop.  Do not fancy that I oppose your wish to convey
this body to the shore, and place it in some sanctified spot.  What I
expressed concerning it was merely the natural feeling that must arise on 
such
an occasion, nothing more."

     "Then you are willing?"

     "I am."

     The two brothers now, without further doubts or remarks upon the 
subject,
got the body into the boat, and laid it carefully down.  Then Edwin folded 
and
tied a handkerchief over the face, for as he truly enough said, --

     "There is no occasion to have to encounter that dead face each moment
that one turns one's eyes in that direction; it is sufficient that we have,
by taking the body in at all done, all that humanity can dictate to us."

     To this Charles agreed, and it was remarked by them both as a strange
thing that from the moment of their taking in the dead body to the boat, the
wind dropped, and finally there was almost a calm, after which there came 
soft
gentle air from the south-east, which enabled them with scarcely any 
exertion
on their own parts to make great progress towards their own home, from which
they found they had not by any means been driven so far northward as they 
had
at first thought.

     The brothers looked at each other, and it was Edwin who broke the
silence, and put into words what both thought, by saying, --

     "Charles, there is something more i[n] this whole affair than what lies
just upon its surface."

     "Yes, it seems as if we were driven out to sea by some special 
providence
to do this piece of work, and that having done it, the winds and the waves
obeyed the hand of their mighty Master, and allowed of our return."

     "It does seem so," said the other.

 Next Time: A Family Scene. -- The Sisters. -- The Horrible Alarm.




                            CHAPTER CLXXXI. [sic]

                               [Chapter 198]

A FAMILY SCENE. -- THE SISTERS. -- THE HORRIBLE ALARM.


     In the course of two hours more, the young men were so close in shore
that they could see the lights flashing along the coast, and they even 
fancied
they could catch a glimpse of human forms moving along with torches; and if
such were the case, they doubted not but that these people were sent to 
serve
as a guide to them should they with their little bark be hovering near the
coast.

     "Look, Edwin," said Charles, "we are expected, are we not?"

     "Yes, yes."

     "I am certain that those lights are meant as guides for us."

     "They may spare themselves the trouble, for do you not see that the
clouds are wearing away, and that in a few minutes more we shall have the
undimmed lustre of a full moon looking down upon us."

     "It will be so."

     The boat had now got so far within a large natural inlet of the ocean
that but very little wind caught its gently flapping sail, so that the
brothers bent manfully to their oars, and got the boat through the water at 
a
rapid rate.

     Oh, how very different their sensations were now to what they had been
when they were beating about at the mercy of the winds and waves, but a few
short hours since, and when it certainly was but an even chance with death
whether they would ever see their home again.

     If a gale had sprung up, accompanied by anything in the shape of a very
heavy sea, they must have been lost.

     Soon they saw that their boat was descried, and at a particular portion
of the coast there stood a complete cluster of men with torches, inviting 
them
there to land, and they knew that such landing place was upon their father's
property, and that in a few minutes they would be safe on shore.

     Neither of them spoke, but reflection was busy in the hearts of both.

     There was a loud and thoroughly English shout, as the boat grated upon
the sandy beach, and Edwin and Charles jumped on shore.  They were in 
another
moment pressed in their father's arms.

     "Why, why, boys," he said, "what a fright you have given us all; 
there's
Clara and Emma have been forced-- I say forced, for nothing but force would 
do
it-- to go home, and the whole country has been in an uproar.  You were 
blown
out to sea, I suppose?"

     "Yes, father, but we have not been in any danger."

     "Not in any danger with such a cockleshell of a boat fairly out into 
the
German Ocean.  But we will say no more about it, lads.  Not another word, 
come
home at once, and make all hearts glad at the old Grange-house."

     "There's something in the boat," cried one of the men who held a light.

     "Good God, yes!" exclaimed Charles.

     "We had forgotten," said Edwin, "we met with a little adventure at sea,
and picked up a dead body."

     "A dead body?"

     "Yes, father, we could not find it in our hearts to let it be, so we
brought it on shore that it might have the rites of Christian burial in the
village church-yard.  Somebody who loved the man may yet thank us for it, 
and
feel a consolation to know that such had been done."

     "You are right boys, you are right," said the father, "you have done in
that matter just as I would wish you; I will give orders for the body to be
taken to the dead house by Will Stephens, and to-morrow it shall be decently
interred."

     This being settled, the father, accompanied by his two sons, who were 
not
a little pleased to be safe upon _terra firma_ again, walked together up a
sloping pathway, which led to the Grange-house, as it was called.

     The joy that the return of the brothers caused in the family, our 
readers
may well imagine.  The sisters Clara and Emma wept abundantly, and the 
mother,
who had let her fears go further than any one else, was deeply affected.

     But it is time that we should inform the reader who these people were,
whom we have introduced upon the scene of our eventful history.

     Sir George Crofton, for such was the name of the father of Edwin and
Charles, was a wealthy warm-hearted country gentleman, and constantly 
resided
upon his own estate all the year round, being a good landlord to his 
tenantry,
and a good father to his four children, who have already been to some extent
presented to the reader.

     The mother was a kind-hearted, but rather weak woman, with an 
evangelical
bias that at times was rather annoying to the family.

     This, however, was perhaps the good lady's only fault, for with that 
one
exception, she was fond of her children to excess, notwithstanding, as Sir
George sometimes jestingly said he verily believed, she in her heart
considered they were all on the high road to a nameless abode.

     The night was so far advanced when the young men got home that, of
course, not much was said or done, and among other things that were put off
until the following morning, was the story of the finding of the body.

     "There is no occasion," whispered Sir George, "to say anything to your
mother about it."

     "Certainly not, father."

     "At least not till to-morrow, for if you do, I shall not get a wink of
sleep for her reflections on the subject."

     The two young men knew very well that this was no exaggeration, and 
that
their mother would, like any divine, eagerly seize the opportunity of what 
is
called "improving the occasion" by indulging in a long discourse upon the
most dismal of all subjects that the mind of any human being can conceive,
namely, the probability of everybody going to eternal perdition unless they
believe in a particular set of doctrines that to her seem orthodox.

     The consequence of this was that the dead body was quietly taken out of
the boat by men who did not possess the most refined feelings in the world,
and carried to the bone house.

     "He seems a decent sort of chap," said one, as he looked at the very
respectable habiliments of the corpse.

     "Ah! look at the gould rings."

     "Yes, you may, look, Abel, but eyes on, hands off."

     "Why?"

     "Why, you gowk, do you think as young Master Charles and Edwin don't 
know
of 'em, and more besides, who would touch dead man's gold off of his 
fingers?"

     "Is it unlucky?"

     "Horrid!"

     "Then I'll have nought to do with un."

     The body was placed on the ground, for there was no coffin of any sort 
to
put it in, and the door was shut upon it in the dead house, and then the 
party
who had brought it there thought it a part of their duty to wake up Will
Stephens the sexton, to tell him that there was such a thing as a dead body
placed in his custody, as it were, by being put into the dead house, which 
was
not above a hundred yards from the cottage occupied by Will.

     They hammered away rather furiously at his door, and no wonder that he
felt a little, or perhaps not a little, alarmed upon the occasion.

     In a few moments a casement was opened and out popped a head.

     "Hilloa! you ragamuffins, what do you mean by hammering away at an 
honest
man's door at this rate, eh?  Am I to have any sleep?"

     "Ragamuffin yourself," cried one; "there's a dead body of a drowned man
in the bonehouse.  All you have got to do is to look after it, and there's a
lot of gold rings on its fingers with diamonds in them, for all we know, 
worth
God knows how much.  You may make the most of it now that you know it."

     "A dead man!  Who is he?"

     "Ah, that's more than we can tell.  Good night, or rather good morning,
old crusty."

     "Stop! stop! -- tell me----"

     The men only laughted, for they had no desire to protract a 
conversation
with the sexton, and he called in vain after them to give him some further
information upon the subject of this rather mysterious information.

     "A drowned man," he pondered to himself, "a drowned man, and with 
fingers
loaded with gems, and brought to the bonehouse!  Oh, pho! pho!  It's a hoax,
that's what it is, and I won't believe it.  It's done to get me up in the
cold, that's all, and then there will be some trick played off upon me safe,
and I shall be only laughed at for my pains."

     Full of this idea, the sexton turned into his bed again, and hoped that
by speedily going to sleep, he should get the laugh of his tormentors, 
instead
of they getting it of him, as well as lose the shivering that had come on 
him
through standing at the open window, exposed to the night air so very
indifferently clad.

 Next Time: The Sexton's Avarice. -- The Dead and the Living. -- The Ring.




                            CHAPTER CLXXXII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 199]

THE SEXTON'S AVARICE. -- THE DEAD AND THE LIVING. -- THE RING.


     It was all very well for the sexton to wish, and to try to got to 
sleep,
but actually to succeed in procuring
          "Nature's sweet oblivion"
was quite another matter.

     In vain he tossed and turned about, there was no rest for him of any 
kind
or description, dreamless or dreamful, and still he kept repeating to 
himself, 
--

     "A dead body, with gold and diamond rings in the bone-house."

     These were the magic words which, like a spell that he was compelled by
some malign influence continually to repeat, kept Will Stephens awake, until
at last he seemed to lose entirely his first perception of the fact that he
might be only hoaxed, and all his imagination became concentrated on the 
idea
of how came the dead body in the bone-house, and how was it that gold and
diamond rings were left on its fingers in such a place?

     These were mental ruminations, the result of which was transparent from
the first, for that result in the natural order of things was sure to be 
that
the passion of curiosity would get the better of all other considerations, 
and
he, Will Stephens, would rise to ascertain if such were really the state of
things.

     "It aint [sic] far off morning, now," he reasoned with himself, "so I 
may
as well get up at once as lie here tossing and tumbling about, and certainly
unable to get another wink of sleep, and besides after all I may be wrong in
thinking this a hoax.  There may really be such a dead body as those fellows
mentioned in the bone-house and if there be, I ought certainly to go and 
look
after it."

     We easily reason ourselves into what is our pleasure, and so while 
these
cogitatory remaks were uttered by the sexton, he rose.

     He found that if he drew back the blind from before his window, the 
moon
which was now sailing through a nearly cloudless sky, would give him amply
sufficient light to enable him to go through the process of dressing, so he 
at
once began that operation.

     "Yes," he said, "I ought to go, it's my positive duty to do so, after
getting the information I have, and if that information be untrue, let it
recoil on the heads of those who invented the falsehood.  I shall go, that's
settled.  What a sweet moonlight."

     It was a sweet moonlight indeed.  The floods of soft silvery light fell
with an uncommon radiance upon all objects, and the minutest thing could 
have
been seen upon the ground, with the same clearness and distinctness as at
mid-day.

     The only difference was that a soft preternatural looking atmosphere
seemed to be around everything, and a kind of marble like look was imparted 
to
all objects far and near on which those soft silvery rays rested in beauty 
and
sublimity.

     The sexton was full dressed, and although the moonlight guided him 
well,
he thought that he might in the bone-house require another mode of
illumination, and he lighted and took with him a small lantren [sic] which 
had
a darkening shade to it.

     Thus prepared, he walked at a rapid pace from his own house towards the
small shedlike building which served as a receptacle for the unowned dead, 
and
for such human remains as were from time to time cast ashore by the waves, 
or
flung up from new graves by the spade and the mattock.

     Familiar as he was and had been for many a year with that bone-house, 
and
often in contact with the dead, he yet on this occasion felt as if a strange
fear was creeping over him, and then a flutter of his heart and the fiery 
feel
that was in his brain were circumstances quite novel to him.

     "Well, this is odd," he said, "and I suppose it is what they call being
nervous I can't make it out to be anything else, I'm sure."

     Thus reasoning with himself upon his own unwonted timidity, he reached
the bone-house.

     The door of the dilapidated building which was known by that name, was
only secured by a latch, for it was not considered that the contents of the
place were sufficiently interesting for any one's cupidity to be excited by
it.

     The sexton paused a moment before he lifte the latch, and glanced 
around
him.  Even then he half expected to hear a loud laugh expressive of the
triumph of those who had combined to play him the trick, if it were one, of
getting him out of his bed on a bootless errand.  But all was still around 
him
-- still as the very grave itself, and muttering then in a hurried tone, "it
is true, there is no trick," he hastily opened the door, and went into the
bone-house.

     All was darkness save one broad beam of moonlight that came in at the
door-way, but the sexton closed the entrance, and applied to his lantern for 
a
light.

     He slid the darkening piece of metal from before the magnifying glass,
and then a rather sickly ray of light fell for a moment upon the corpse that
lay then upon its back -- a ray only sufficiently strong and sufficiently
enduring to enable the sexton to make quite sure that there was a body 
before
him, and then his lantern went out.

     "Confound the lantern!" he said, "I ought to have looked to it before I
started, instead of lighting it on the mere hazard of its going on
comfortably.  What's to be done?  Ah, I have it, I remember."

     What the sexton remembered was that on the same wall in which the door
was situated, there was a large square aperture only covered by a kind of
shutter of wood, the withdrawal of a bolt from which would cause it to fall 
in
a moment on its hinges.

     The sexton knew the place well, and drawing back the somewhat rusty 
bolt,
down went the shutter, and a broad flood of moonlight fell at once upon the
corpse.

     "Ah," said Will Stephens, "there it is sure enough.  What a long
odd-looking fellow to be sure, and what a face-- how thin and careworn
looking.  I do very much wonder now who he really is?"

     As he continued to gaze upon the dead body, his eyes wandered to the
hands, and then sure enough he saw the bright and glittering gems the men 
had
spoken of, and which the salt water had not been able to tarnish into 
dimness.
Perceiving that the setting was gold and the stones real, --

     "Ahem!" said Stephens, softly; "they will not bury the corpse with 
those
rings on his fingers.  Why, he must have half a dozen on at least; they will
be somebody's perquisite of course, and that somebody won't be me.  The idea
of leaving such property unprotected in a bone-house!"

     Will Stephens remained now silent for a short time, moving his head 
about
in different directions, so that he caught the bright colours of the jewels
that adorned the dead man's hands, and then he spoke again.

     "What's more easy," said he, "than for some of the very fellows who
brought him here, to slip back quietly, and take away every one of those
rings?"

     After this much, he went to the door of the bone-house and listened, 
but
all was perfectly still; and then his cogitations assumed another shape.

     "Who saw me come from my house?" he said. -- "Nobody.  Who will see me 
go
back to it? -- Nobody.  Then what is to hinder me from taking the rings, 
and--
and letting the blame lie on some one else's shoulders, I should like to 
know?
Nothing will be easier than for me to say in the morning that owing to the
strange and insolent manner in which the information was given me of the
arrival of the dead body in the bone-house, I did not believe it and 
therefore
did not rise, and so-- so I think I may as well eh?"

     He thought he heard something like a faint sigh, and the teeth 
chattered
in his head, and he shook in every limb as he bent all his energies to the
task of listening if there were really any one in or at hand, playing the 
spy
upon him.

     All was as before profoundly still, and with a long breath of relief, 
he
cast off his terror.

     "What a fool I am to be sure," he said; "it was but the wind after all,
no doubt, making its way through some one of the numerous chinks and 
crevices
in this shed; it did sound like a sigh from some human lips, but it wasn't."

     The propriety of making short work of the affair, if he wished to do it
at all, now came forcibly to the mind of the sexton, and arming himself with
all the courage he could just then summon to his aid, he advanced close to 
the
corpse.

     Kneeling on one knee he took up one of the hands from which he wished 
to
take the rings, and when he saw them closer, he felt convinced that they did
not belie their appearance, but were in reality what they seemed to be --
jewels of rarity and price.

     The hand was cold and clammy and damp to the touch, and the knuckles 
were
swollen, so that there was great difficulty in getting the rings over them,
and the sexton was full five minutes getting one of them off.

     When he had done so, he wiped the perspiration of fear and excitement
from his brow, as he muttered, --

     "That's always the case with your drowned folks, they are so swelled 
when
first they come out of the water, and so I shall have quite a job, I 
suppose."

     The sexton's cupidity was, however, now sufficiently awakened, to make
him persevere, despite any such obstacles, in what he was about, and
accordingly, kneeling on both knees he clasped the wrist of the dead man in
one hand, and with the other strove to coax off, by twisting the hoop of 
gold
round and round, a ring that had one diamond, apparently of great value, set
in it, and which the robber of the dead thought was a prize worth some 
trouble
in the obtaining.

     In an instant, the dead hand clasped him tight.

 Next Time: The Recovery. -- The Sexton's Fright. -- The Compact.




                            CHAPTER CLXXXIII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 200]

THE RECOVERY. -- THE SEXTON'S FRIGHT. -- THE COMPACT.


     What pen shall describe the abject fright of Master Will Stephens, the
sexton, as the cold clammy fingers of the supposed corpse closed upon his
hand.

     The blood seemed to curdle at his very heart -- a film spread itself
before his eyes -- he tried to scream, but his tongue clove to the roof of 
his
mouth, and he could utter no sound.

     In good truth he was within an ace of fainting, and it was rather a
wonder that he did not go clean off.

     Power to withdraw his hand from the horrible grasp he had not, and 
there
he knelt, shivering and shaking, and with his mouth wide open, and the hair
literally bristling upon his head.

     How long he and the dead man remained in this way together in silence, 
he
knew not, but he was aroused from the state of almost frenzy in which he 
was,
by a deep sepulchral voice -- the voice of the apparently dead.

     "What has happened?" it said, "what has happened?  Is this the world
which was to come?"

     "M-m-mer-cy-- help," stammered the sexton.  "I-- I-- I-- am a poor man-
-
I-- I don't want your rings, good Mr. -- Mr. Ghost.  Oh-- oh-- oh-- have 
mercy
upon me I-- I-- implore you."

     The only reply was a frightful groan.

     The perspiration rolled down the sexton's face.

     "Oh, don't-- oh, pray don't-- hold-- hold me so-- so tight."

     "Now," said the dead man, "I know all.  The dye [sic] is cast; my fate
has again spoken.  Steel shall not slay me, the bullet shall kill me not, 
fire
shall not burn me, and water will not drown while yon bright satellite sails
on 'twixt earth and heaven."

     "Yes-- yes, sir."

     "Thefi at [sic] has gone forth, and I am wretched, oh, Heaven so
unutterably wretched!"

     "Perhaps, good Mr. Ghost, you-- you will let me go now.  Here's your
ring, I don't want to keep it.  Here's the only one I took off your 
worshipful
fingers, good Mr. Ghost."

     A very thin filmy sort of cloud had been going over the moon's disc, 
but
now had passed completely away, and such a flood of unchecked untempered
brillancy poured in at the open window, if it might be so called of the
dead-house that it became quite radiant with the silvery beams.

     The drowned man rose with a wild howling cry of rage, and springing at
the throat of the sexton, bore him down to the earth in an instant, and 
placed
his knee upon his chest.

     "Villain," he groaned out between his clenched teeth, "you shall die,
although you have made me live.  There shall be one victim to the fell
destroyer."

     The sexton thought his hour was come.

     "Wretch!" pursued the revived corpse, "wretch, what devil prompted you 
to
do this most damnable deed?   Speak-- speak, I say, who are you?"

     "What-- what deed?" gasped the sexton.

     "The deed of restoring me to life-- of dragging me from the ocean, and
forcing me to live again."

     "I-- I-- oh dear."

     ["]Speak.  Go on."

     "I didn't do anything of the sort.  The truth is, I only came to-- to--
to----"

     "To what?"

     "To borrow a ring of you, that's all, and the greatest calamity that 
ever
happened to me is your coming to life."

     "How came I here?"

     "That I can't tell your worship.  I am the sexton of this place, it's
called Culburn, and is in Suffolk, and they picked your worship up at sea, 
and
brought you here.  That's all I know about it, as I hope for mercy.  It 
can't
do you any good to kill a poor fellow like me.  I don't think you are a 
ghost
now, but some ugly-- no I mean handsome fellow-- supposed only to be 
drowned."

     "Do you tell me truth?"

     "As I live, and hope your worship will let me live I do.  And here's 
the
ring, I came to borrow of you, sir, as a proof."

     "Of what?"

     "Of-- of-- of-- I hardly know what to say to you, sir."

     "If you are not the great enemy to me that I thought you-- you are a 
mere
thief.  You came to steal the jewels I had upon my fingers.  Is not that the
truth?"

     "I-- I rather think it is, sir."

     "You may save your wretched life if you like.  If you promise me that 
you
will keep all that has happened a secret, except so much of it as I shall
empower you to reveal, I will spare you; but if after having so promised, 
you
break faith with me, and let your tongue wag further than I wish it, you 
will
not live twenty-four hours afterwards, be assured, for I will find you out,
and twist your head from your shoulders."

     "Anything, sir, I will promise anything, I will swear if you like."

     "I heed no oaths.  Consideration for your own safety will keep you
silent.  Rise."

     He took his knee off the chest of the sexton and his hand off his 
throat,
and then Will Stephens tremblingly rose to his feet.  The idea did cross him
for a moment of measuring his strength with the resuscitated man, but when 
he
beheld the tall, bony, gaunt figure before him, he saw he had not the shadow
of a chance in a personal struggle.

     Moreover he had a lively remembrance of a most vice-like pressure upon
his throat, which seemed to say that the ugly stranger was by no means in an
exhausted state.

     Upon the whole, then, the sexton was glad to have escaped so well.

     "You have only to say, sir, what you would have me do," he said.

     "Answer me first.  Have you always lived here?  Is this your native
place?"

     "Oh, no, sir, I came from London; but then it's years ago."

     "Very well.  You must say that you remember me in London, as a 
gentleman
of good repute, and you must add that you came to the bone-house here, and
found me reviving, and that you took measures to complete my recovery."

     "Yes, sir.  And here is your ring."

     "Keep it as a memento of this affair."

     "Many thanks, sir.  Will it please you to tell me your name and
condition?"

     "John Smith, a foreign merchant; and now tell me, minutely, how I was
rescued from the ocean, or did the waves themselves give up their dead?"

     The sexton who was now assured in his own mind that it was no ghost he
was speaking to, entered as far as he knew into the story of the finding the
body, and bringing it to the bone-house, but as that information was not
great, he volunteered, if Mr. Smith would go with him to his cottage, to get
him all the particulars.

     To this the other consented, and they both left the bone-house 
together.

     On the short bit of road, the sexton began to think that his companion
must be some madman, for ever and anon when the moon was brightest, he saw 
him
lift up both his arms to it, as if he were worshipping it, and at those 
times
too, he heard him mutter some words in a language that he did not 
comprehend.
At length the singular being spoke in English.

     "Henceforth," he cried, as if quite forgetful of the presence of 
another,
"henceforth, begone remorse, begone despair.  The great sea has rejected me,
and not again will I seek destruction; I will live, and I will live to be 
the
bane and curse of the beautiful."

     "Sir," said the sexton, "here is my house, sir; if you will step in, I
will soon dish you up a little something in the way of refreshment.  You 
see,
sir, I live alone, that is to say, an old woman who keeps my cottage in 
order
and waits upon me goes away at night, and comes again in the morning, but as
it is not her time yet, I will get you anything you like to eat or to 
drink."

     "I never eat nor drink."

     "Not eat! -- nor-- drink!  Never, sir?"

     "Never.  I shall cost you nothing to entertain me.  I want some rest, 
and
while I am taking it, do you go and get me such information as you can
regarding me.  Make no concealment that I am alive, but go at once, and 
return
with what expedition you may, and remember that your fate is in my hands."

     "I will, sir."

     The sexton was quite terrified enough to do what he was bidden, and
perhaps, the consciousness that the strange and mysterious man whom he had 
for
a guest might accuse him of the projected robbery of the jewellery he had
about his person influenced him more than the rather obscure threat of
personal vengeance by the promised screwing his head off.

     But the matter, take it for all in all, was anything but an agreeable 
one
for Master Will Stephens, and most heartily did he wish he had remained in 
his
bed and left the stranger to recover, if was to recover, by himself.  Will 
did
not attribute that recovery to the moonlight he had himself let in.

                            CHAPTER CLXXXIV. [sic]

                               [Chapter 201]

THE NIGHT ALARM. -- THE VAMPYRE'S ATTACK UPON THE BRIDE.


     The particulars concerning the bringing in of the body that had been
picked up at sea by the brothers Edwin and Charles Crofton, were to be 
learnt
from many mouths so soon as the sexton evinced a disposition to know them, 
and
in a very short time, and as the daylight was making the fainter and more
spiritual light of the moon fade away, he again reached his own abode, where
he had left a guest of whom the reader knows much, but of whom Will Stephens
knew but little.

     He found the self-christened Mr. Smith waiting for him rather
impatiently.

     "Well," he cried, "your news? your news?"

     "May be told, sir, in a few words," replied the sexton, and then he 
made
his new fried acquainted with the whole story, just as he had heard it of 
the
fishermen on the coast.

     Mr. Smith, or as we may as well call him at once the vampyre, hesitated
for a few moments as if he had not exactly and accurately made up his mind
what to do, and then he said, --

     "You will go to the Grange-house and tell the story that I have before
informed you I would have told.  Be sure that you expatiate upon my 
gentility
and respectability, for I want to be upon good terms with the Crofton 
family."

     "Well, but sir, I'm a tenant of Sir George Crofton's and so you see---"

     "What," said the vampyre, his eyes flashing with indignation as he 
spoke
"dare you dispute my positive commands?"

     "No, sir, I-- I only----"

     "Peace caitiff, and know that I hold thy life in my hands for your
attempted robbery of me."

     The sexton trembled.  That was indeed the weak point now of all his
defences against whatever commands might be put upon him by his master, as 
we
may now call the vampyre, although after all it was but the usual dominion 
of
a strong mind over a weak one, for there was not so much in reality for the
sexton to be afraid of as his own guilty conscience dictated to him.

     It were easy enough for the vampyre to charge him with robbery, but not
at all so easy for him to prove such a charge, and at the same time to
substantiate, as by some inquisitive counsel he might be called upon to do,
his own position in society.

     But it is most true
     "Conscience doth make cowards of us all."
And feeling that his intention regarding the rings of the supposed drowned 
man
had been of a dishonest character, he could not summon courage sufficient to
defy him now.

     "I will go," he said, "I am going."

     "'Tis well."

     In far from the pleasantest train of thought the sexton went to the
Grange, and asked to see Mr. Charles Crofton, and to him he related the
version of the resuscitating of the supposed drowned man.  It was heard 
with,
as might be expected, the most profound astonishment, and the sexton soon
found himself confrounted with the whole assembled family, and force to 
repeat
the wonderful facts over again.

     It seemed, as indeed it might well do, a something quite beyond belief.

     "Why, Edwin," said Charles, "he must have been in the water far beyond
the length of time that it mostly takes to drown any one before we saw him."

     "I think so too."

     "It must be so, for this reason, that he was a considerable distance 
from
land, and there was no vessel near enough for him to have come from."

     "Hold!" said Sir George Crofton, "my dear boys, you are forgetting the
most important fact of all."

     "Are we, father?"

     "Yes, and that is that the gentleman is alive.  You cannot get over 
that,
you know, and as I have often heard that whatever is is natural, why there's
no use in disputing any more about it; and besides how do we know but that 
he
was in some boat which was swamped a few minutes before you saw him."

     "That is a most rational suppositon," said Edwin.

     "And that we can say nothing against," added Charles; "what is to be 
done
father?"

     "Why, do not let us do good by inches, we know that this is the only
decent house within a considerable distance for a gentleman to remain in, if
he have the habits of comfort about him.  So Master Stephen, [sic] if you 
will
go and give our compliments to the stranger, and ask him to come here, I 
shall
be much obliged to you."

     "I will, Sir George."

     "And you can tell him that we are plain folks, but assure him of a 
hearty
welcome."

     Will Stephens made his bow and exit.

     "Well," said Edwin, "it's very odd, although of course, it must be all
right, and I am the last person who would wish to make anything out of a
common-place event, but to all appearances dead he was when we took him into
the boat, and I never before heard of a spontaneous recovery like this from
such a state."

     "Then you have added to your stock of experience," said his father,
laughing, "and I must own, for my own part, that I am rather curious to see
this person, who was a curiosity in appearance, according to your accounts
when he was dead or supposed to be dead."

     "He was so," remarked Charles, "for I am certain you might travel the
world over without meeting a more singular looking man than he was; in the
first place, he looked particularly tall, but that might have arisen from 
the
fact that we only saw him in a horizontal position, and then there was a
something about the expression of his face which was perfectly 
indescribable,
and yet at the same time filled you with feelings of curiosity and dread."

     The sisters heard this account of the mysterious stranger with feelings
of great interest.

     "Why," said Emma, "we have all of us often complained of being dull 
here,
but such an animal as this will be quite an acquisition."

     "And just as Clara is going, too, what a pity," laughed Edwin.

     "I shall endeavour to survive the horrid disappointment," said Clara, 
for
she was to be married on that day, to one who had been the chosen companion 
of
her heart for many a day, and was to leave the home of her childhood to
proceed far away to his house in Wales, where she was to be the light of joy
to another admiring and loving circle.

     "Ah, well, I pity you," said Emma.

     "Then you had better at once," remarked Clara, forbid the occasional
visits here of a certain young officer who, I'm afraid, has some audacious
intentions."

     The ready colour flushed to the cheek of the younger sister, who had
scarcely expected such a retort, although she had fairly provoked it.

     "Come, girls," said the father, "we will have no more lance breaking
between you about your lovers."

     "Certainly not, father," said Clara, "but then, you know, unless Emma 
is
made to see that she is vulnerable, she will go on tormenting me."

     "In other words, Emma," said Edwin, "you see that people who live in
glass houses should not throw stones-- a most useful maxim."

     "I don't care for any of you," said Emma, half crying, as she ran out 
of
the room.

     Clara followed here, for there was really the very best understanding 
and
the kindest feeling between the two young girls, although occasionally a 
smart
repartee would be uttered upon some such occasion as the present, but all 
that
was soon forgotten.

     The sexton who was getting each moment more and more uneasy about the
share he had in the affair of the resuscitated man of the bone-house, went
back to the cottage, and there informed the self-named Mr. Smith of the
success of his mission to the Grange-house.

     "You think they will welcome me," said the vampyre.

     "I am sure of it, sir.  They are the frankest, freest family I ever 
knew,
and they would not have asked you to got to the Grange if they did not mean 
to
use you well."

     "And there are two daughters?"

     "Yes, sir."

     "And young and fair, you tell me."

     "They are two as handsome girls as you will find in this part of the
country, sir.  They have always been much admired.  One of them, as I before
mentioned, is going to be married and taken away, but the other stays at
home.["]

     "'Tis well, not you will not fail to remember the awkward situation in
which you are.  Keep the ring which you took from my finger, and with it 
keep
your own counsel, for any babbling upon your part will most assuredly lead 
to
your destruction."

     "Yes, sir, I know."

     "And although that destruction might not be immediate, you would lead a
life of trembling terror until your doom was accomplished, and that doom
should be a dreadful one in its manner.  Now farewell! farewell! and 
remember
me."

     "I shall never forget you the longest day I have got to live," said the
sexton, with a shudder, as he saw the tall, angular, gaunt-looking form of 
his
most mysterious new acquaintance leave his cottage, and make his way towards
the Grange.

 Next Time: The Defile in the Rocks. -- The Horseman and the Accident.




                            CHAPTER CLXXXV. [sic]

                               [Chapter 202]

THE DEFILE IN THE ROCKS. -- THE HORSEMAN AND THE ACCIDENT.


     The Grange-house was visible from the cottage of the sexton, and so the
vampyre had declined the offer of Will Stephens to be his guide.

     As it happened, though, it would have been better regarded his reaching
the Grange quickly that he should have taken the sexton with him, for the
cliffs that were close at hand concelaed [sic] to the eye many deep gulleys
and frightful precipices that had to be coasted round, before any one could
reach the Grange-house by that route.

     If he could have gone directly onward, about half a mile's walking 
would
have sufficed to enable him to reach the place, but before he had proceeded 
a
quarter of that distance, he came upon a deep ravine or splitting in the
cliff, too wide to jump across, and with all the appearance of extending
inland a considerable distance without narrowing.

     "I had indeed better have brought a guide with me," muttered Varney.

     He then paused for a few moments, as if he was debating with himself
whether or not he should return back and get the sexton.  But the mental
hesitation did not last long, and accustomed as he was to trust to his own
sagacity and his own resources more than to other people, he walked along by
the side of the fissure in the cliff, muttering to himself, --

     "Were all the guides in the country here, they could but do as I am
doing, namely, walk on until the ravine closes."

     With this idea he pursued it, but to his mortification he found that it
widened instead of presenting the least symptoms of closing, and suddenly it
opened to his eyes to a width of about fifty feet, and he paused again
irresolute.

     "How am I to proceed?" he said; "this is a perplexity."

     He advanced close to the brink, and looked down.  The depth was very
considerable, and at the bottom there was evidently a road made of sand and
chalk, which wound down somewhere from the interior of the country to the
sea-beach.

     As he looked, he heard the rapid sound of a horse's feet.

     In another moment there dashed down the road towards the sea, a horse
bearing on his back a man, who was exerting himself in every possible way to
stop the maddened, headlong career of the animal, but it would not be 
checked.

     With starting eyes and dilated nostrils, and with its flanks covered 
with
foam, the frighted steed, which had evidently come some distance in that
state, rushed on, but the broken nature of the ground made it almost
impossible that it should make such great speed then as it had been making, 
at
least with any degreee [sic] of safety.

     This was what occurred to the thoughts of Varney, and it was 
sufficiently
proved to be a correct idea, by the horse stumbling the next moment, and
throwing his rider heavily upon the sand and broken rock that was strewn
around.

     The steed, now disincumbered of its load, recovered itself in a moment,
and with a snort of rage and probably of pain likewise, dashed and 
disappeared
from the sight, round the abrupt corner of the ravine to the left hand on 
the
beach.

     "So be it," said the vampyre, calmly; "another being is snatched away
from the muster roll of the living, one who perhaps would gladly have
preserved his existence, while I-- I remain and cannot, let me do what I 
will
to accomplish such a purpose, shake off the cumbrous load of life that will
cling to me."

     Suddenly quite a whirlwind of passion seemed to come on him, and,
standing on the brink of the ravine with his arms extended, he cried, --

     "Since death is denied to me, I will henceforward shake off all human
sympathies.  Since I am compelled to be that which I am, I will not be that
and likewise suffer all the pangs of doing deeds at which a better nature 
that
was within me revolted.  No, I will from this time be the bane of all that 
is
good and great and beautiful.  If I am forced to wander upon the earth, a
thing to be abhorred and accursed among men, I will perform my mission to 
the
very letter as well as the spirit, and henceforth adieu all regrets, adieu 
all
feeling-- all memory of goodness-- of charity to human nature, for I will be 
a
dread and a desolation!  Since blood is to be my only sustenance, and since
death is denied to me, I will have abundance of it-- I will revel in it, and
no spark of human pity shall find a home in this once racked and tortured
bosom.  Fate, I thee defy!["]

     He continued for some few moments after uttering this speech in the 
same
attitude in which he had spoken the words.  Then suffering his hands slowly 
to
fall, again he looked cold, and passionless, as he had been before.

     But his determination was made.

     By looking carefully about him, he saw that there was a kind of 
footpath
down the side of the ravine, which an active person might descend by,
although, probably, not altogether without some risk, for the least false 
step
might precipitate him to the bottom.

     The vampire, however, had no such fears.  He seemed to feel that he
possessed a kind of charmed life, and that he might adventure to do what
others might well shrink from.

     This feeling begot a confidence which was almost certain to be his
protection, even if it had been only founded upon imagination, for it
fortified his nerves, and when he began the descent down the side of the
ravine, it was without the smallest terror.

     He found, however, that when he was fairly on the path, it was a better
and a wider one than he had a first supposed it to be, and in the course of
five minutes he had got completely down to the narrow road, on which,
apparently dead, lay the wounded man, for he was only grievously hurt by his
fall, although he was quite insensible.

     The vampyre strode up to him.

     "Ah," he said, "young, and what the world would call handsome.  Ha! ha!
Heaven takes but little care sometimes of its handiwork."

     After a few moments' contemplation of the still form that lay at his
feet, he knelt on one knee by its side, and placed his hand upon the region 
of
the heart, after roughly tearing open the vest of the stranger.

     "He lives-- he lives.  Well, shall I crush the fluttering spirit that 
now
is hovering 'twixt life and death, or shall I let it linger while it may
within its earthly prison?  Let it stay.  The worst turn that any one can do
another in this world, is surely to preserve existence after once the pang 
of
what would be all the agony of death is past."

     The vampyre rose, and was moving away up the ravine, when a sudden
thought seemed to strike him, and he turned back again.

     "Gold," he said, "is always useful to me, and I think with my new
thoughts and feelings it will now be more so than ever.  This insensible man
may have some about him."

     Again he knelt by the side of the young man, and soon possessed himself
of a tolerably well-stocked purse that he found upon him.  Round his neck,
too, by a thin chain of gold, hung a small portrait of a young and beautiful
girl, upon which Varney gazed intently.

     "She is fair," he said, "very fair-- she would make a fit victim for 
me.
I will take this portrait; it might stand me in some stead should I 
encounter
the original."

     He placed the portrait in his pocket, and was in the act of rising, 
when
he heard the sound of a footstep.

     "Ah, some one comes; it will be no part of my plan to have been seen by
the body."

     He darted forth down the narrow gorge or ravine, and was soon
sufficiently hidden from the sight of those who were advancing.  They proved
to be some fishermen going to spread their nets upon the beach, which just
below the spot where the seemingly fatal accident had taken place, was as
level as a carpet, screened from the wind, and composed of the finest sand.

     Of course, it was impossible to avoid seeing the body that lay in their
path, and Varney had no need to be fearful that he would be seen, when an
object of so much greater and more absorbing interest lay in their direct 
and
unavoidable path.

     He heard from the sudden exclamations that fell from them, that they 
had
seen the body, and upon advancing a step or two, he found that they were
collected round it in a dense throng, for there were about a dozen men in 
all.

     "'Tis well," said Varney, "it matters not to me if he be living or 
dead.
I can doubtless now find my way to the Grange-house by this path along the
shore.  I will pursue it at all events, and see whither it will lead me."

     He did so, and after going about half a mile, he found another ravine,
which, upon entering and ascending for a time, led him quite close to one of
the entrances of the Grange-house, as it was called, and which he was so
anxious to reach.

 Finding the Body.

                               [Chapter 203]

THE DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE GRANGE. -- THE NEWS OF DESPAIR. -- THE FINDING THE
BODY.


     It was a fine old place the Grange, view it from what aspect you might,
and had not the mind of Varney, the vampyre, been so fearfully irritated by
the circumstances of his horrible existence, he must have paused to admire 
it.

     It was one of those ancient English edifices, which, alas, are fast
disappearing from the face of once merry England.  Railways have gone 
tearing
and screaming through the old parks and shady glens.  Alas, all is altered
now, and for the sake of getting to some abominable place, such as 
Manchester,
or Birmingham, in a very short space of time, many a lonely spot of nature's
own creating is marred by noise and smoke.

     "So," said Varney, "this then is the home of these young men who have
done me such an injury as to rescue me from the sea."

     He ground his teeth together as he spoke, and it was quite clear that 
he
felt disposed to consider that a most deadly injury had been done to him by
Edwin and Charles Crofton, who had only followed the proper dictates of
humanity in rescuing him from the waves.

     "It shall go hard with me," added Varney, "but I will teach such 
meddling
fools to leave the great sea in charge of its dead.  Oh, had I but been
allowed to remain until now, which but for these officious perso[ns] might
still have been the case, I should have sunk deep-- deep into the yellow
sands, and there rotted."

     His passion as he uttered these words had in it something fearful, but
in a few moments the external symptoms of it passed away, and he walked
slowly and to all appearance calmly enough towards the Grange.

     The distance he had to go was still as before, a deceiving one, for he
had to wind round a clump of trees before he really got to the gate, which
appeared to be just in sight, but at length he reached it, and paused as he
saw an old man, who was a kind of warder there.

     "Is this Sir George Crofton's?" he said, and he threw into his voice 
all
that silvery softness which at times had been so fascinating to the
Bannerworth family.

     "It is, sir."

     "Will you announce me?"

     "I do not leave this gate, sir, but if you go down this avenue, you 
will
reach the mansion, and some of the servants will attend to you."

     Varney walked on.

     The avenue was one formed by two stately rows of chestnuts, the 
spreading
branches of which met over head, forming a beautiful canopy, and
notwithstanding that they were so near the sea-- that foe to vegetation, 
these
trees were in good truth most luxuriantly beautiful.

     "There was a time," muttered Varney, "when I should have admired such a
spot as this, but all that has long since passed away.  I am that which I 
am."

     He now arrived in front of the house itself, and being perceived by one
of the domestics, he was politely asked what he wanted.

     "Say that Mr. Smith is here," was the message that Varney gave.

     The servant had already heard that such was the name of the person who
had been rescued from the sea by his young masters Edwin and Charles, he now
hastened with the information to the drawing-room, where the family was
assembled.

     "Oh, if you please, sir, he has come."

     "Who has come?"

     "The drowned man, Mr. Smith."

     "Admit him instantly."

     The servant ran back to Varney, and then politely ushered him into the
large really handsome room, in which the family sat awaiting his arrival 
with
no small share of curiosity.  What the sexton had said of him had excited 
much
speculation, and the eagerness to see a man who was, as it were, a present
from the sea, was extreme.

     "Mr. Smith," announced the servant; and Varney with one of his courtly
bows, and a smile that was half hideous, half charming, entered.

     There was a decided effect produced by his appearance, and perhaps that
effect is best described by the word awe.  They all seemed as if they were 
in
the presence of something very peculiar, if not something very superior.

     Sir George Crofton broke the rather awkward silence that ensued by
addressing his visitor with all the frankness that was a part of his nature.

     "Sir," he said, "I am glad to see you and hope you will make yourself 
as
much at home as if you were in a house of your own."

     "Sir," said Varney, "you know how much I owe your family already, and I
fear to increase the heavy debt of gratitude."

     "Oh, you are welcome, most welcome.  Stay here as long as you like; we
are rather dull at times in this isolated house, and the arrival of an
intelligent guest is always an event."

     Varney bowed, and Edwin advanced.

     "Mr. Smith," he said, "I suppose I may almost call myself an old
acquaintance."

     "And I," said Charles.

     "Gentlemen, if you be those to whom I am indebted for my preservation, 
I
owe you my warmest thanks."

     "Oh, think nothing of it," said Sir George; "it was not at all likely
that my two boys would see a fellow creature in such a situation, and not,
dead or alive, take possession of him.  Your recovery is the only remarkable
thing in the whole affair."

     "Very remarkable," said Varney.

     They waited a moment as if he was expected to make some sort of
explanation of that part of the business, but as he did not, Sir George said
--

     "You have no idea of how you became resuscitated."

     "Not the least."

     "Well, that is strange indeed."

     "Perhaps the good fellow who afforded me an immediate shelter, applied
before that, some means of recovering suspended vitality."

     "Oh no.  Will Stephens is to the full as much surprised as any one.  
But,
however, I dare say, to you, sir, that is not the most entertaining subject 
in
the world, so we will say no more about it, except that we are very glad to
have a living guest instead of a dead one."

     "I much fear, from what I have heard," said Varney, "that I shall be
intruding at a time like this into your family circle."

     "Oh, you allude to the marriage to-day of one of my daughters, and that
puts me in mind of really quite an omission on my part.  Mr. Smith-- my
daughters, Clara and Emma."

     The vampyre bowed low, and the young ladies went with established grace
through the ceremony of the introduction to the remarkable personage before
them.

     At this moment there came upon the ears of all assembled there the 
sound
of hurried footsteps, and a servant without any ceremony burst into the
apartment, exclaiming --

     "Oh, Sir George-- Oh, oh, sir--"

     "What is it?  Speak!"

     "Oh, oh.  They have found him-- killed in the ravine."

     "Who, who?"

     "Mr. Ringwood, as was to be married--"

     "My daughter."

     Clara uttered a cry of despair, and sank into a chair in a state of
insensibility.  The scene of confusion and general consternation that now
ensued baffles all description, and the only person who looked calm and
collected upon the occasion was Mr. Smith, although it was not the insulting
calmness of seeming indifference.

     In a few minutes, however, Sir George himself recovered from the first
shock which the intelligence had given to him, and he said, --

     "Where is he?  Where is he?  Let me to the spot."

     "And allow me, sir, to accompany you," said Varney.  "Believe me, sir, 
I
feel deeply for the family misfortune.  Let me be useful."

     "Thank you, sir, thank you-- Edwin, Charles, come with me and this
gentleman, and we will see if this dreadful report be true.  Let us hope 
that
fear and ignorance have exaggerated a very simple affair into so seemingly
dreadful a circumstance.

     Leaving Clara to the care of her sister and some of the female 
domestics
of the Grange, who were hastily summoned to attend upon her, the little 
party,
consisting of Sir George, his two sons, Varney, and several of the
men-servants, turned from the Grange in the direction of the ravine.

     Their intimate acquaintance with all the neighbourhood enabled them to
reach the place much sooner than Varney thought it possible to do, and as 
they
came within sight of the spot where the accident had occurred, they saw a
crowd of villagers and fishermen assembled.

     They quickened their pace, and forcing through the throng, Sir George
Crofton saw his intended son-in-law, to all appearance, lying dead and
bleeding on the sands.

     Such a sight was enough, for a moment, to paralyse every faculty, and 
it
really had, for a time, that effect upon Sir George.

                               [Chapter 205]

A MIDNIGHT ALARM. -- THE CHASE. -- THE MYSTERY.


     Young Ringwood did awaken about two hours afterwards, and the state he
was in, although not such as to create alarm, was not pleasing to Dr. North.
That gentleman desired that he should be carefully watched and kept quiet,
while he went to his own house for some medicines.

     He returned as soon as he possibly could, and administered such 
remedies
as he considered the urgency of the case required, and having, as he always
made a practice of doing, left word at his own house where he was, he 
offered
to remain at the Grange the whole of the night.

     It is scarcely necessary to say, that such an offer was most gratefully
accepted.

     Clara was profuse in her acknowledgements of the doctor's kindness, and
they all passed the evening together in the large dining room, to which 
Varney
was first introduced.

     Not, however, for a long time had so gloomy an evening been passed at 
the
Grange as that; nobody was in spirits, and although there was a great deal 
of
conversation, it somehow assumed always a very sombre shape, let it commence
on what subject it might.

     Half past ten o'clock was the usual hour at which the family reitred 
for
the night, and it was quite a relief to every one, when that hour came, and
Sir George ordered lights for the bed chambers.

     Clara, indeed, being much oppressed, had retired some time before, and 
so
had Emma, so that there were none but gentlemen in the dining room at half
past ten.

     "I have ordered a bed to be prepared for you close to your patient's,"
said Sir George to Dr. North.

     "Oh, thank you, but I shall only lie down in my clothes, a couch would
have done just as well, I am used to sitting up all night upon occasion."

     "No doubt, but I hope you will not be disturbed, and that
tomorrow-morning we shall have a better account of your patient."

     "I hope so too; a good calm night's rest may do much."

     "You speak doubtingly."

     "Why in these cases it is difficult to know the extent of injury.  
There
is no fracture of the skull, but it is as yet impossible to say what amount 
of
shaking he has had."

     "Well, we can but hope for the best.  Mr. Smith, although we retire at
this early hour, there is no sort of occasion for you to do so.  Order what
wines you please, and sit as long as you please."

     "By no means, Sir George; I am a great patron of early hours myself."

     Varney was shown into a bed-room which was upon the same floor with 
those
of the family, and which formed one of a range of chambers, all opening from 
a
corridor that ran the entire length of the house, and which in the daytime 
was
lighted by a very large, handsome window at one end, while at the other was 
a
broad flight of stairs ascending from the lower part of the house.

     The sisters occupied contiguous chambers, and then there was an empty
room, and next to that again was the bed-room in which was Ringwood, and 
then
Dr. North's.

     Exactly opposite was Varney's room, and colse [sic] at hand slept the
sons, while Sir George himself occupied a room at the furthest corner of the
corridor.

     Emma made Clara an offer to sleep with her that night, as she was in
grief and anxiety, but this Clara would not permit, for she could not think 
of
sacrificing her sister's repose to attend upon her.

     "No, Emma," she said," I will hope for the best, and strive to rest."

     The bade each other affectionately good night, and shortly afterwards
retired to their separate apartments.

     By eleven o'clock all was still in the house.

     Dr. North had begged a book from the library, for he thought it likely
enough that he should not be able to get much repose, and with that he sat 
in
his room, the only one, as he thought, in all the house who was not in bed.

     He continued reading for about an hour, and then, after visiting his
patient, and finding him asleep, he thought it would be just as well for him
to pull off his boots and his coat, and lie down on the bed to snatch a few
hours' sleep.

     He performed all the operations but the final one -- the sleeping -- 
for
scarcely had he lain down, when he heard a soft sliding sort of noise close 
to
the room door, he thought, and he sprung up in a sitting posture to listen 
to
it.

     "Who's there!" he cried.

     There was no answer, and jumping off his bed, he took the light which 
he
had not put out, and opened his door.  All was deserted and still in the
corridor.

     "Imagination, or some accidental noise that I am not familiar with," 
said
the doctor, as he closed his door again.

     Down he laid himself, and he was just upon the point of getting to 
sleep,
when he heard a scratching sound as he thought upon the very panel of the 
door
of his room.

     Up he sprang again, and this time without the delay of asking who was
there; he opened his door, and looked out into the corridor, holding the 
light
above his head so as to diffuse its rays as much as possible, but he saw no
one, and all the other doors were close shut.

     "A plague take it," he said, "I may keep myself at this sort of thing 
all
night, if I am foolish enough.  It's a cat, perhaps, for all I know; however
it may scratch away, I won't move again."

     Shutting the door, he lay down, now fully determined that he would not
move, unless something very much out of the common way, indeed, should take
place.

     Again he started.  There was a curious sound about the lock of his 
door,
and he listened intently.

     "Now, what on earth can that be?"

     All was still, and he nearly dropped asleep.  Twice, however, he 
thought
he heard the sound again, but he would not move, and in a few moments more, 
he
was enjoying a sound repose.

     How long this repose lasted, he had no means of telling, for he was
suddenly awakened by such a cry, that at first he lay overpowered completely
by it, and unable to move.  It was a loud shrieking cry, such as might come
form any one in a most dreadful agony.

     "Good Heaven!" he cried, "what's that?"

     Now, Dr. North was not a fearful man, nor a nervous one, and he soon
recovered.  Besides, such a cry as that, he knew very well, must have the
effect of arousing everybody in the house, so he sprung out of his bed, and
rushed to the door.

     It was fast.

     In vain he tried the lock, and hammered at it and pushed.  The door was 
a
thick and a heavy one, and it was quite clear he was a prisoner.

     This was serious, and he cried out, --

     "Help! help! here, undo the door, undo the door.  Who has locked me 
in?"

     He heard the scraping of feet, the sound of voices, the ringing of 
bells,
and all the symptoms of a suddenly disturbed and alarmed household, but 
nobody
paid any attention to him.  He dragged on his boots, in order that he might 
be
able to keep up a constant kicking on the lower part of his door, and he did
keep it up with a vengeance.

     At length he heard voices close to his door, and some one cried, --

     "Open the door, sir, open the door!"

     "Open it yourself," said Dr. North, "you have fastened it on the 
outside,
I suppose."

     There was some further running about, and then with a crash the door 
was
forced open with a crowbar, and upon emerging from the apartment, the doctor
found assembled in the corridor, the whole family, with the exception of the
two girls, and several servants half-dressed bearing lights.

     "What's the matter," cried Sir George, "what's the matter?"

     "Ah," said the doctor, "that's what I want to know."

     "Yes, why-- why you made all the disturbance."

     "I beg your pardon, there was a scream came from somewhere, and when I
tried to come out to find what it was, my room door was fast.  That's all I
know about it."

     Bang -- bang, bang, bang, came now a sound.  Bang, bang, bang; and all
eyes were turned in the direction of the chamber occupied by Mr. Smith, and
they heard his voice from within shouting in loud and frightened tones.

     "Help! help! is it fire!  Open my door, help-- help.  Do you lock in 
your
guests here?  Help!"

     "Why, God bless me," said Dr. North, "that gentleman is locked in
likewise."

     "But it can't be," said Sir George, "for the keys of all these doors 
are
in the library in a drawer.  The fact is, we none of us fasten up our
bed-rooms, and the keys were all removed years ago."

     "Help! help! help!" cried Mr. Smith.

     "Break the door open," said Sir George, "this is inexplicable to me, I
cannot make it out in the least."

     The same crow-bar that had been brought by one of the servants to bear
upon the door of Dr. North's room, was now applied to that of Mr. Smith, and
it soon yielded to the force of the lever that was used with strength and
judgment.

     Mr. Smith partially dressed, and with rather a terrified look, emerged.

     "Good God," he cried, "I wish you wouldn't lock one in; what has
happened?  I heard a shriek that awoke me up, as if the last trumpet had
sounded[.]"

     "My daughters, are they safe," cried Sir George.

     He flew to the door of Clara's room, it yielded to his touch.

     "Clara, Clara," he called.

     "I am paralysed," said Dr. North, "and so are you, sir.  Come in."

     He seized a light from one of the servants, and with a presentiment 
that
there was to be found a solution of, at all events, the mystery of the
dreadful shriek that had alarmed all the house, he dashed into the chamber 
of
the young girl, followed by the father.

                               [Chapter 204]

THE SICK CHAMBER AT THE GRANGE. -- THE NIGHT.


     "Is he dead?  Is he dead?  cried Sir George.

     "We don't know, sir," replied one of the fishermen; "some of us think 
he
is, and some of us think he is not."

     "What is to be done?"

     "Have him taken at once to the Grange, father," said Charles, "and let 
us
get medical assistance; who knows but the affair may turn out in reality 
very
different from what it first appeared.  He may be only stunned by a fall."

     "I hope to Heaven it may be so.  Can you, among you, my men, make
anything like a litter to carry him on?"

     This was soon done.  Some of the loose seats from some boats close at
hand, and a rough cloak or two, made a capital couch for the dead or wounded
man, as the case might be.  They lifted him carefully into it, and then four
of them lifted the rude but easy and appropriate conveyance, and carried him
towards the hall.

     "How could this have happened?" said Sir George.

     "Perhaps I may be able to throw some light upon it," said Varney.  "As 
I
came here to your hospitable house, a horse without a rider, but caparisoned
for one, passed me furiously."

     "That must have been his horse then,"  said Charles.  "You may depend,
father, he was riding on to see Clara before the hour appointed for their
marriage, and has met with this accident.  Come, there is some consolation 
in
that.  A fall from his horse is not likely to kill him."

     "Where is Edwin?"

     "Oh, he went off at once for Dr. North, and no doubt he will get to the
Grange about as soon as we shall."

     "That was right-- that was right.  I really have been taken so much by
surprise that I hardly know what I am about.  It was very right of Edwin."

     Nothing of any importance now passed in the way of conversation, nor 
did
any incident worth recording take place until the melancholy little 
procession
reached the Grange, and by the advice of Varney, the young bridegroom was
carried direct to a bed-chamber before he was removed from the litter on 
which
he had been carried.

     The operation was scarcely performed, and he laid upon a bed, when Dr.
North came, having mounted his horse upon hearing the information from Edwin
that he was wanted in a case of such great emergency at the Grange, and 
ridden
hard all the way.

     He was at once introduced to his patient, and upon a cursory 
examination,
he said, --

     "This is a concussion of the brain, but don't let that alarm you.  It 
may
be very slight, although it certainly has an awkward sound, and a little 
rest
and blood-letting may put him all to rights."

     This was to some extent cheering, and the doctor at once proceeded to
bleed his patient.  As the ruddy stream fell into a crystal goblet, the 
young
man gradually opened his eyes, and looked round him with a bewildered glare.

     "Darken the room," said Dr. North; "he is right enough, but he must be
kept quiet for a day or two at all events."

     "What has happened?"  said the wounded man.

     "Nothing particular," replied Dr. North, "nothing particular.  You have
had a fall from your horse."

     "Clara!"

     "Ah, I know, and now listen to me.  If you remain quiet and don't 
speak,
you will see Clara soon; but if you are wilful and disobey orders, you will
bring on a brain fever and you wont [sic] see her at all in this world; so 
now
you can judge for yourself."

     "You are rather harsh," said Sir George.

     "Pardon me sir, I am not.  There is nothing like making a patient
thoroughly understand his own position; and I give this young gentleman 
credit
for sufficient wisdom to enable him to profit by what I say to him."

     Mr. Ringwood nodded.

     "There, you see, all's right; now he will go to sleep, and as all will
depend upon the state in which he awakens, I will, if you please wait here,
unless I should be urgently sent for from home, for I have left word where I
am."

     "Pardon me, doctor, for finding any fault with you."

     "Don't mention it; what I said did sound harsh."

     Sir George went now at once to the room where his daughter Clara had 
been
taken to, for the purpose of informing her of the hopeful state of affairs.
He found her just recovered from her swoon, so that recollection had not yet
sufficiently returned to give her all the agony of thinking that the news so
heedlessly and so suddenly communicated by the servant might be true in its
full intensity.

     "My dear, you must not distress yourself," said Sir George.  "Ringwood
was riding over here, it seems, to see you, and his horse, getting restive,
has thrown him; Dr. North says, there is nothing particular the matter, and
that after a little rest he will recover."

     Clara tried to speak, but she could not -- she burst into tears.

     "Ah!" said the old  nurse, who was attending her, and who had been in
her family many years, "ah, poor dear, she will be all right now.  I was 
just
wishing that she would have a good cry; it does any one a world of good, it
does."

     "What an agitating night and day this has been, to be sure," said Sir
George.  "First the terror of losing both my boys, then their return with 
the
dead man, who, so oddly comes to life again; Then this dreadful accident to
Ringwood; upon my word the incidents of a whole year have been crammed into 
a
few hours.  I only hope this is the last of it."

     "And I shall see him again, father," sobbed Clara.

     "Of course you will."

     "You-- you have sent him home very carefully?"

     "Home? no.  He is here under this roof and here he shall stay till he
recovers, poor lad.  Oh dear no, I never thought of sending him home, but I
must send some one, by-the-by, with the news of what has happened.  This is
well thought of."

     The knowledge that her lover, and her affianced husband was doing well,
and that he was under the same roof with her, gave Clara the most unalloyed
satisfaction, and she recovered rapidly her good and healthful looks.  It 
was
duly explained to her, that she must not go near Ringwood to disturb him, as
rest was so very essential to his recovery; so she did not attempt it.  The
whole household was commanded to be unusally quiet, and never had the Grange
before presented such a collection of creeping domestics, for they went up 
and
down stairs like so many cats.

     Clara did not omit to thank Mr. Smith for the assistance he had 
rendered
them in this evil emergency, and Dr. North stood with the family in the 
dining
room waiting, perhaps with greater anxiety than he chose to express, the
awaking of his patient.

     A servant was left in the adjoining chamber to that occupied by 
Ringwood,
who was told to bring to the dining-room the first intimation that the 
wounded
man was living.

     About two hours elapsed when the servant came in with an air of 
affright.

     Dr. North sprang to his feet in a moment.

     "What is it, is he awake?"

     "Not exactly awake, sir, but he is speaking in his sleep, and it's all
about a-- a----"

     "A what?"

     "A vampyre."

     "Stuff."

     "Well, sir, he's a having some horrid dream, I can tell you, sir, and 
he
said, 'Keep off the vampyre; save her, oh, save her from the vampyre!'"

     "How singular!" said Varney, "what an absurd belief that is!  A 
vampyre!
what on earth could have put such a thing in his head, I wonder?"

     "I will go to him," said Dr. North, "if he should be very much 
disturbed,
perhaps I shall think it preferable to awake him; but I can inform you all
that such dreams show that there is much excitement going on in the 
brain.["]

     "Then you do not consider the symptom favourable, doctor?"

     "Certainly not; quite the reverse of favourable."

     Dr. North rose, and as Varney offered very politely to accompany him, 
he
made no sort of objection, and they proceeded to the chamber of the
bridegroom.

     During the time that the doctor had been in the society of Varney, he 
had
been much pleased with him, for he found that he possessed a vast store of
knowledge upon almost any subject that could be touched upon, besides no 
small
amount of skill and theoretical information upon medical matters, so he let
him come with him, when perhaps he would have objected to any one else.

     Varney the vampyre could fascinate when he liked.

     When they reached the chamber the young man was quiet, but in a few
minutes he began to toss about his head, and mutter in his sleep, --

     "The vampyre, the dreadful vampyre.  Oh, save her!  Help, help, help!"

     "This won't do," said the doctor."

     He went to the toilette table, and procuring a large towel he soaked it
well in cold water, and then wrapped it round the head of Ringwood, and so
carefully too as not to arouse him.  The effect was almost instantaneous.  
The
vexed sleeper relapsed into a much easier attitute, the breathing was more
regular, and the distressing fancies that had tortured his fevered brain 
were
chased away.

     "A simple plan," said Varney.

     "Yes, but a most efficacious one."

                               [Chapter 206]

THE SIGHT OF TERROR. -- THE DOCTOR'S SUSPICIONS. -- THE NIGHT WATCH.


     The sight that met the eyes of the father in his daughter's chamber, 
was,
indeed, one calculated in every respect to strike him with horror and 
misery.

     Emma was lying insensible at the side of the bed, and Clara seemed to 
be
dead, for she was ghastly pale, and there was blood upon her neck.

     The father staggered to a seat, but Dr. North at once rushed forward, 
and
held the light to the eyes of Clara, at the same time, that he placed his
finger on her wrist to note if there was any pulsation.

     "Only a fainting fit," he said.

     "But the blood-- the-- the blood," cried Sir George.

     ["]That I know nothing about, just at present, but let us see what's 
the
matter here.["]

     He raised Emma from the floor, and found that she too had fainted, but 
as
she appeared to be perfectly uninjured.  She slightly recovered as he lifted
her up, and he resigned her at once to the care of some of the female
servants, who now made their appearance in the chamber, all terribly alarmed
at the shriek that had awakened them.

     "This is strange," said Dr. North, "here is a small puncture upon the
throat of your daughter Clara, that almost looks like the mark of a tooth."

     "A tooth!"

     "Yes, but of course that cannot be."

     "Hear me, oh, hear me," cried Emma, at this moment.  "Horror-- horror!"

     "What would you say-- speak at once, and clear up this mystery if you
can.  What has happened?"

     ["]I heard a noise, and came from my own chamber to this.  There was 
some
one bending over the bed.  'Twas I who shrieked.["]

     "You?"

     "Yes, oh yes!  'Twas I.  I know not what then happened, for I either 
fell
or was struck down, and I felt that my senses left me.  What has happened?  
I
too ask; oh, Clara!  What was it? what was it?"

     "Imagination, most likely," said the doctor.  "You had better go to 
your
room again, Miss Emma, for you are trembling with cold and apprehension.
Perhaps in the morning, all this affair will assume a different shape.  At
present we are all to much flurried to take proper congisance of it.  There
your sister is rapidly recovering.  How do you feel now, Miss Clara?"

     "I-- I-- am mad!"

     "Oh, pho! pho! nonsense!"

     "Oh, God help me!  How horrifying !  How more than dreadful!  That 
awful
face!  Those hideous teeth! -- I am mad! -- I am mad!"

     "Why, my dear child, you will drive me mad," cried Sir George, "if you
talk in such a strain.  Oh, let me beg of you not."

     "Don't heed her," said Dr. North.  "This will soon pass away.  Come, 
Miss
Clara, you must tell me freely, as your medical man, what has happened.  Let
us hear the full particulars, and then you know well, that if any human 
means
can aid you, you shall be aided."

     This calm mode of discourse had evidently a great effect upon her, and
after the silence of a few moments, she spoke much more collectedly than
before, saying, --

     "Oh, no-- no!  I cannot think it a dream."

     "What a dream?"

     "You-- you shall hear.  But do not drag me from my home, and from all I
love, if I am mad; I pray you do not--  I implore you!"

     "You are quite safe.  Why, what a ridiculous girl you are, to be sure.
Nobody wants to drag you from your home, and nobody will attempt such a 
thing,
I assure you.  You have only to tell us all unreservedly, and you will then 
be
quite safe.  If you refuse us you confidence how can we act for you in any
way?"

     This argument seemed to be effective, and to reach her understanding
quite, so that after a shudder, and a glance around her of great dread and
dismay, she spoke, saying in a low, faltering voice, --

     "Something came; something not quite human, yet having the aspect of a
man.  Something that flew at me, and fastened its teeth upon my neck."

     "Teeth! everbody says 'teeth!'" exclaimed the father.

     "Hush!" said the doctor, with an admonitory wave of his hand; "keep 
that
a secret from her, whatever you do.  I implore you, keep quiet on that head.
Well, is that all, Clara?"

     "Yes-- yes."

     "Then it was a dream, and nothing else, I can assure you.  Nothing but 
a
dream; make yourself comfortable, and think no more of it.  I dare say you
will have a quiet sleep now, after this.  But you had better let your sister
Emma lay with you, as your nerves are a little shattered."

     "Oh, yes, yes."

     Emma, who truth to tell, was very little better than her sister,
professed her readiness to stay, and the doctor giving Sir George a nod, as
much as to say, "Let no more be said about it just now," led the way from 
the
room at once.

     When he reached the corridor, where Varney and the two sons were 
waiting,
he said, --

     "We shall none of us after this, I am certain, feel inclined to sleep;
suppose we go down stairs at once and think and talk this matter over
together; there is more in it, perhaps, than meets the eye; I will follow 
you
in a moment, when I have just seen that my patient is all right."

     They all proceeded down stairs to the dining-room, and in a few 
minutes,
the doctor followed; lights were procured, and they sat down, all looking at
the doctor who had taken the lead in the affair, and who evidently had some
very disagreeable, if not very true, ideas upon the subject matter of the
evening's disturbance.

     "Well, doctor," said Sir George, "we rely upon you to give us your
opinion upon this business, and some insight into its meaning."

     "In the first place then," said the doctor, "I don't understand it."

     "Well, that's coming to the point."

     "Stop a bit; it was no dream."

     "You think not."

     "Certainly not a dream, two people don't dream of the same thing at the
same time; I don't of course deny the possibility of such a thing, but it is
too remarkable a coincidence to believe all at once; but Emma avows that she
saw a somebody in her sister's room."

     "Ah," said Sir George; "she did, I had in my confusion forgotten that
horrible confirmation of Clara's story.  She did so, and before Clara was 
well
recovered too, so she could not have put the idea into her head.  Good God!
what am I to think?  For the love of Heaven some of you tell me what are 
your
opinions upon this horrible affair, which looks so romantically unreal, and
yet so horrible real."

     All except the doctor looked at each other in surprise.

     "Well," he said, "I will tell you what the thing suggests; not what it
is, mind you, for the afffair to me is too out of the way of natural causes 
to
induce me to come to a positive conclusion.  Before I speak, however, I 
should
like to have your opinion, Mr. Smith; I am convinced it will be valuable."

     "Really I have formed none," replied Varney; "I am only exceedingly
surprised that somebody should have fastened me in my bed-room.  I know that
that circumstance gave me a terrible fright, for when I heard all the outcry
and confusion, I thought the house was on fire."

     "Ah! the locking of us in our rooms, too," said the doctor, "there's
another bit of reality.  Who did that?"

     "It puzzles me beyond all comprehension," said Sir George; "how the 
doors
could be locked I cannot imagine; for as I told you the keys are in a drawer
in my library."

     "At all events, the doors could not lock themselves, with or without
keys," said Charles; "and that circumstance shows sufficiently evidently 
that
some one has been at work in the business whom we have still to discover."

     "True," said Mr. Smith.

     "Well, gentlemen," added the doctor, "I will tell you what I suggest; 
and
that is contained in a letter, written a long while ago by a distant 
relation
of mine, likewise a surgeon.  Mind, I do not of course pledge myself at the
present time, for the truth and accuracy of a man who was dead long before I
was born; he might too have been a very superstitious man."

     "But what did he suggest?"

     "He did more than suggest; he wrote for a medical publication of that 
day
an account, only of course suppressing names, of the appearance of a 
vampyre."

     "A what?"

     "A vampyre!"

     "I have heard of such horrors," said Mr. Smith, "but really at the
present day, no one can think of believing such things.  Vampyres indeed!
No-- that is too great a claim upon one's credulity.  These existences, or
supposed existences, have gone the same way as the ghosts, and so on."

     "One would think so, but you shall hear."

     Sir George Crofton and his sons looked curious, and thought that the
doctor was going to draw upon his memory in the matter to which he alluded,
but he took from his pocket a memorandum book, and from it extracted some
printed papers.

     "The communication was so curious," he said, "that I cut it out of the
old volume in which it appeared, and kept it ever since."

     "Pray," said Mr. Smith, "what was the name of your distant relation, 
the
medical man?"

     "Chillingworth."

     "Oh, indeed; an odd name rather, I don't recollect ever hearing of it."

     "No, sir, it is not likely you should.  Dr. Chillingworth has been dead
many years, and no one else of his name is at present in the medical
profession to my knowledge.  But you shall hear, at all events, what he says
about it."

     The doctor then opened the folded paper, and read as follows: --

     "Notwithstanding the incredulity that has been shown regarding 
vampyres,
I am in a condition from my own knowledge to own the existence of one, I 
think
he is dead now.  His name was Varney, at least that was the name he went by,
and he came strangely enought under my observation, in connection with some
dear friends of mine named B----"

     "Is that all?" said Mr. Smith.

     "Not quite," replied Dr. North, "He goes on to say that but for 
touching
the feeling of living persons, he could and would unfold some curious
particulars respecting vampyres, and that if he lived long enough he will
perhaps do so, by which I suppose he meant if he outlived the parties whose
feelings he was afraid of hurting by any premature disclosures."

     "And-- and," faltered Sir George, "do you draw a conclusion from all
that, that my daughter has been visited by one of these persons-- surely 
not."

     "May be, Sir George; I draw no conclusions at all, I merely throw out 
the
matter for your consideration.  It is always worth while considering these
matters in any possible aspect.  That is all."

     "A most horrible aspect," said Sir George.

     "Truly dreadful," said Mr. Smith.

     "This shall be settled," said Charles, "Edwin and I will take upon
ourselves to-morrow night to set this question completely at rest."

     At this moment there was a loud cry of "Help, help, help," in the voice
of Emma, and they all rushed up stairs with great speed.

     "Oh, this way, this way," she cried, meeting them at the head of the
stairs.  "Come to Clara."

     They followed her, and when they reached the room, they found to their
horror and surprise that Clara was dead!

 Next Time: Family Troubles. -- The House of Mourning.




                              CHAPTER CXC. [sic]

                               [Chapter 207]

FAMILY TROUBLES. -- THE HOUSE OF MOURNING.


     It was too true.  It was not the mere appearance of death, but the
reality of the fell destroyer that the Crofton family had to mourn.  She 
who,
but a few short hours since, was in all the bloom of apparent health, and
youth, and beauty was now no more.

     The poor father, the sisterless sister, the astonished, indignant, and
agonised brothers formed a group that was too sad to contemplate.

     As they gazed upon the wreck of her whom they had all loved so fondly,
they could scarcely believe that death had indeed claimed her as her own; 
they
     "Thought her more beautiful than death,"
and could not, as they gazed tremblingly upon her still form, bring 
themselves
to believe that she had indeed gone from them for ever.

     Dr. North, however, soon put all doubt upon the subject to rest by an
announcement that her spirit had really fled.  In vain he tried all the 
means
that his art suggested.  That mysterious and mighty something which we call
life, which we miss and yet see no loss, which is so great, yet so 
evanescent
and impalpable, was gone.

     "Come away," he said, "we can do no good here now.  Come away, all of
you!"

     "Oh, no, no," cried Sir George.  "Why should we leave my child?"

     "That," said the doctor, as he pointed to the corpse, "that is not your
child."

     The old man shuddered, and with an aspect upon his face, as if ten 
years
of added age had at least passed over him in those few momemts, he suffered
them to lead him from the room.  They all passed down stairs again, leaving
Emma in her own chamber along with the female servants, so hastily again
called up to remain with her.

     When the dining-room was reached once more, Mr. Smith, who bore all the
appearance of being quite thunder-struck by what had passed, spoke in the 
most
feeling manner, saying, --

     "This is truly one of the most affecting circumstances I ever remember.
It is dreadful; a young girl to be at once snatched from a circle of 
admiring
and loving friends in this manner, is too sad a picture for any one with a
heart to feel for the distresses of others to contemplate.  What, sir, is 
your
opinion," to Dr. North, "of the actual cause of death?"

     "The shock to the nervous system I suspect has induced some sudden 
action
of the heart that has been too much for vitality."

     "Dreadful!"

     "Alas, alas!" sobbed Sir George.  "What have I done, that Heaven should
thus launch against me the bolts of its bitterest vengeance?  Why should I 
be
robbed of my child?  Surely there were angels enough in Heaven withoug 
taking
mine from me."

     "Hush, hush," said Dr. North; "you are in grief, sir, and know not what
you say.  These were not else the words that would fall from the lips of 
such
a man as you are."

     The bereaved father was silent, and the sons looked at him with
countenances in which dismay was most strongly pictured.  They seemed as if 
as
yet they had not become fully alive to the loss they had sustained, or of 
what
had really happened within the once happy domestic circle, of which the
fairest portion was now so ruthlessly dragged from them.

     "It is like a dream," said Edwin, addressing his brother Charles in a
whisper.  "It is much more like a dream than aught else in the world."

     "It is, it is.  Oh, tell me that this is not real."

     "It is too real," said the doctor, "you must bow with what amount of
resignation you can call to your aid to that stroke of destiny which you
cannot control; you should consider that as regards her who has gone from 
you,
that she is now no object of pity.  Death is an evil to you in your loss, 
but
it is the end of all evil and pain to her; and then again, she has but gone 
a
few years, after all, earlier than usual, for how long shall we-- ay, the 
best
and strongest of us-- be behind her?"

     This was consolation of the right sort, and was sure to have its effect
upon persons in the habit of conversing coolly [sic] and calmly upon general
subjects, so that in a short time, the father even felt much better, and
although the sons were quite convinced of their loss they no longer looked 
at
each other with such bewildered aspects, but exhibited the rational grief of
men.

     Charles spoke after a time with great energy, saying,--

     "It is true that we may call our reason to our aid, and contrive to rid
ourselves of our grief in a great measure; but there is another duty we have
to perform, and that is, to diligently inquire why and how it was, that our
sister got this horrible fright, that has had the effect of hurrying her 
into
eternity."

     "Yes, brother," said Edwin, "you are right! our sister's memory shall 
be
vindicated, and woe be to him who has brought this desolation and grief upon
us.

     Sir George looked from one of his sons to the other, but said nothing; 
he
appeared to be prostrated too much by his feelings, and the doctor strongly
urging him to retire to rest, he shortly did so, where we will leave him for 
a
time, hoping that he will find the oblivion of sleep creep over him, and
     "Knit up the ravelled sleeve of care."

    "Now," said Dr. North, "here we are four men with cool heads, and active
enough judgments.  For Gods's sake, let us try to come to some sort of
conclusion about this dreadful affair.  What do you say, Charles?"

     "In the first place, I should recommend that the house be searched
diligently, in order that we may see if any stranger is in it, or discover 
any
means by which an entrance to the premises has been effected.  We don't know
but that after all some robbery may be the aim, and that the fright of our
sister which has had so fatal an effect, may be the consequence merely of 
the
appearance of a thief in her room.

     "Agreed," said Edwin, "let the search of the house be our first step."

     Two of the new servants were summoned with lights, and the party of 
four
proceeded to an examination of the house, which on account of its size was 
not
a very short process, for there was so many staircases and rooms opening the
one into the other, that the hiding places were numerous enough.

     At length, however, they were not only satisfied that no one was
concealed on the premises, but likewise that all the fastenings were quite
secure, and had been made so before the servants retired to rest.  The 
mystery
therefore was rather increased.

     Had there not been the collateral evidence of Emma and the singular 
fact
of the fastening up of the doors of the doctor's and Mr. Smith's bed-
chambers,
no doubt the whole affair would have rested where it was, and have been put
down as a remarkable death arising from the influence of a dream.

     But that was out of the question -- somebody had been seen, and whether
that somebody was really not an inhabitant of this world was the question.

     In the midst of all this, the day began to dawn.

     Sir George had had no sleep, but he had done himself some good in the
solitude of his own chamber.  He had prayed long and earnestly, and his
prayers had had the effect which they almost invariably have upon all
imaginative persons, namely, of bringing him an amount of mental calmness,
peace, and resignation, highly desirable in his circumstances.

     The breakfast table was laid in silence by the servants, and when Sir
George met his sons and his guests, he spoke calmly enough, saying to them, 
--

     "You will no more hear from me the accents of grief or of despair.  I
accept what consolation I can find, but as a man, and a father I will have
justice; my child has been terrified to death, and I will find who has done
the deed, for let him be whom he may, he is as much her murderer as though 
he
had plunged a dagger in her heart."

     "It is so," said Mr. Smith.

     "Being so, then let him beware."

     Varney thought that as the father uttered these last words, he glanced
in a peculiar manner at him, but he was not quite sure that such was the 
case.
Had he been sure, perhaps, he would have taken other steps than he did.

     Little more passed during the breakfast, but when the meal was over, 
Sir
George said, --

     "Edwin, we are but dull and poor company to Mr. Smith; it will amuse 
him,
perhaps, if you take him through the grounds, and show him the estate."

     Edwin made no objection, and as the thing was put in the shape of an
amusement to him, Varney could only say some civil things, and rise to go.

     "I regret," he said, "to be of so much trouble."

     "Not at all," said Edwin, "no trouble, sir; my own mind, God knows, 
wants
something to distract it from too close a contemplation of its own thoughts.
If you will accompany me in a walk over the estate, it will, perhaps, put me
into better spirits."

     They left the room, and when they were gone, Sir George Crofton rose 
and
shut the door, fastening it on the inside carefully, rather to the surprise 
of
the doctor and his son Charles, who looked at him in silence.

     "Charles," he then said, "and you, doctor, I have something particular 
to
say to you."

     "What is it?  What is it?"

     "God forgive me if I am wrong, but I suspect our guest? [!]"

     "Mr. Smith?"

     "Yes, I don't like his looks at all; now we know nothing of him but 
from
his own report; we have searched the house right through, or at least you
have, you tell me, and found nothing.  He is the only stranger within our
doors.  Perhaps it is uncharitable to suspect him, but I cannot help it, the
thought came too strongly upon me last night, as I was alone in my chamber,
for me to overcome it.  I have now spoken to you both frankly, and tell me
what are your thoughts."

     "I don't like him," said Charles.

     "He is a singular man," said Dr. North.

     "What-- what now if he were-- were--"

     "Why do you hesitate, father? what would you say?"

     "Go on, sir," said Dr. North, with a nod, that signified, I know very
well what you are going to say.  "Go on, sir."

     "What, then, if it were really true, that there were such things, and 
he
is a vampyre?"

     Edwin sprang to his feet in surprise, and said, --

     "Good God! you put a frightful idea into my brain that will now never
leave it.  A vampyre?"

     "Heaven forbid," added Sir George, "that I should say such a thing
heedlessly, or that I should take upon myself to assert that such is the 
case;
I merely throw it out as a supposition-- a horrible one, I grant, but yet 
one
that perhaps deserves some consideration."

     "Get rid of him," said Dr. North.

     "It is difficult after telling him he was welcome to stay, to now tell
him that we want him to go.  I would much prefer watching him closely, and
endeavouring by such means, either to confirm or to do away entirely with my
suppositions.  And you can take an opportunity of speaking to Edwin upon the
subject, quietly and carefully."

     "I will, father."

     "Then we can be all upon the alert; but above all things I charge you 
say
nothing to Emma of the really terrific idea.  Only I should say that to-
night
it is in the direction of her chamber that I would wish to keep the closest
watch.["]

     "And that, too, without her knowing it," said the doctor.  "If she is
aware of anything of the sort, there is no knowing what tricks her 
imagination
might play her, and now, Sir George, I must say that I take the greatest
interest in the matter, and will with your permission remain here until I am
sent for.  Poor Ringwood still reminds insensible, and I take it that under
the circumstances that it is really a mercy, for what a sad communication 
has
to be made to him, when he does recover sufficiently to hear it."

     "Sad, indeeed."

     It was now finally agreed among them that there was to be no variation
whatever in their conduct towards Mr. Smith, but that after they had taken
leave of him for the night, and had all gone to bed, they should each glide
out of his chamber, and wait at the extreme end of the [corridor] in 
silence,
to mark if anything should happen.

     This was duly announced to Edwin, who with a shudder announced that he
had his suspicions, too, of Mr. Smith, so he of course came into the scheme 
at
once; and now they waited rather anxiously for the night to come again.

 Next Time: The Night Watch. -- The Surprise. -- The Chase.




                             CHAPTER CXCI. [sic]

                               [Chapter 208]

THE NIGHT WATCH. -- THE SURPRISE. -- THE CHASE.


     Everything was now said and done that could induce a feeling in the 
mind
of Varney, that he was perfectly welcome at the Grange, and to dispel the
least idea of anything in the shape of supposition that he might have had,
that he was suspected, although he had not himself by word or look betrayed
such a feeling.

     The day to all parties seemed a frightfully long one.  Ringwood 
remained
in the same state of unconsciousness as he had been in the day previous, and
the only circumstance that served to break the monotony of the time, was the
arrival of some of his friends to see him.

     It is not essential to our story that we should take up space in
detailing what they said and what they did; suffice it that all the grief 
was
exhibited that was to be expected, and that finally they left the Grange 
with
a conviction that the wounded man was in as kind hands as they could 
possibly
wish him, and everything would be done, that kindness and skill could 
suggest,
to recover him and preserve his life.

     Probably the dreadful catastrophe that had happened in the family of 
the
Croftons had in effect in reconciling the Ringwoods to the lesser calamity,
for Dr. North gave them strong hopes of his ultimate recovery.

     And so the time passed on, until the dim shadows of the evening began 
to
creep over the landscape, and the distant trees imperceptibly mingled 
together
in a chaotic mass.  The song of the birds was over -- the herds and flocks 
had
sought their shelter for the night, and a solemn and beautiful stillness was
upon the face of nature.

     Assembled once more in the dining-room of the Grange, were the Croftons
-- but not Emma, she was in her chamber -- the doctor, and Mr. Smith.

     Varney had exerted himself much to be entertaining, and yet not
obtrusively so, as under the calamitous and extraordinary circumstances in
which the family was placed, that would have been bad taste; but he led the
conversation into the most interesting channels, and he charmed those who
listened to him, in spite of themselves.

     Dr. North was peculiarly pleased with so scientific a companion, and 
one
who had travelled so much, for Varney spoke of almost every portion of the
globe as familiar to him.

     In this kind of way, the evening sped on, and more than once, as Varney
was giving some eloquent and comprehensive description of some natural
phenomenon that he had witnessed in some other clime, not only were the
suspicions entertained agaist him forgotten, but even the grief of the 
family
faded away for a brief space before the charm of his discourse.

     At length the time for rest came.

     Sir George rose, and bowing to Varney, said, --

     "Do not let our example influence you, sir.  We retire now."

     "I shall be gald to do so," said Varney, "likewise; last night was a
disturbed as well as a melancholy one for all in this house."

     "It was indeed."

     In another five minutes, the dining-room was vacant, and all that could
be heard in the house was the noise of putting up extra bars, and shooting
into their places, long unused bolts in order that it should be quite beyond
all doubt that no one could get into the premises.

     After that, all was still.

     The moon was in her last quarter now, but only at the commencement of 
it,
so if the night proved not to be cloudy, it would be rather a brilliant one,
which might, or might not be of service to those who were going to watch in
the corridor the proceedings of Mr. Smith.

     An hour elapsed before there was any movement whatever, and then it was
Dr. North who first, with great care, emerged from his room.

     He had drawn on his stockings over his shoes, so that his footsteps 
might
not be heard, and he took his station in a dark corner by the large window 
we
have before spoken of as lighting the corridor.

     The moon was up, but it only shone in obliquely at the window,, [sic] 
so
that one side of the corridor was enveloped in the deepest gloom, while on 
the
other the pale rays fell.

     A few minutes more, for half-past eleven was the hour on which they had
all agreed, and Sir George, with Edwin and Charles joined the doctor, who
merely nodded to them, as they could faintly see him.

     Sir George spoke in a very faint whisper, saying, --

     "We are well armed."

     "Good," replied the doctor, in a similar cautious tone, "but let me
implore you to be careful how you use your arms.  Do nothing hastily I beg 
of
you; you don't know what cause of regret the imprudence of a moment may give
rise to."

     "Depend upon us, we will be very careful indeed."

     "That is right."

     "We had better not talk," said Charles, "these corridors cary sound
sometimes too well; if we are to do any good, it must be by preserving the
profoundest silence."

     This advice was too practical and evidently good to be neglected, and
consequently they were all as still as they could be, and stood like so many
statues for the next half hour.

     They heard a clock that hung in the hall below strike the hour of 
twelve,
and when the reverberations of sound were over, a stillness even more 
profound
than before seemed to pervade the whole house.  The half hour they had 
waited
in such silence appeared to them to be of four times the usual length, and
they were glad to hear twelve strike.

     Still they said nothing, for if silence before twelve o'clock was a 
thing
to be desired, it was much more so after that hour, for it was then that the
alarm of the preceeding evening had taken place.  Their watchfulness, and
their anxiety momentarily increased.

     The old clock in the hall chimed the quarter past twelve, and yet all 
was
as still as the grave; not the smallest sound disturbed the repose of the
house.

     The moon had shifted round a little, so that the gloom of the corridor
was not so complete as it had been, and Dr. North was aware that in another
hour the spot where they all stood would be visited by some rays which would
render their concealment out of the question.

     But as yet all was right, and there was no need to shift their position
in the least.

     Suddenly Sir George Crofton laid his hand upon the arm of the doctor, 
and
an exclamation involuntarily escaped him, but not in a loud tone.

     "Hush, for God's sake," whispered the doctor.

     They had all heard a slight noise, like the cautious opening of a door. 
They looked eagerly in the direction from whence it came, and to their
surprise they found it proceed from the chamber of the dead!

     Yes, the door of the room in which lay the corpse of Clara slowly 
opened.

     "God of Heaven!" said Sir George.

     "Hush-- hush," again whispered the doctor, and he held him by the arm
compulsively.

     All was still.  The door creaked upon its hinges a little, that was 
all.

     A quarter of an hour passed, and then Sir George was about to say
something, when he started as if a shock of electricity had been applied to
him, for the door of Varney's room was swung wide open, and he appeared, 
full
dressed.

     All the doors opening from the corridor creaked unless they were flung
open smartly and quickly, and there could be no doubt but that Varney knew
this, and hence the apparent precipitancy of his appearance.

     There he stood in the moonlight, close by the threshold of his room,
gazing about him.  He bent himself into an attitude of intense listening, 
and
remained in it for some time, and then he with slow sliding steps made his 
way
towards the door of Emma's room.

     His hand was actually upon the lock, when Sir George, who could stand 
the
scene no longer, levelled a pistol he had taken from his pocket, and without
giving any intimation to those who were with him of what he was going to do,
he pulled the trigger.

     The pistol only flashed without being fully discharged.

     "How imprudent," said the doctor.  "You have done it now!  Follow me!"

     He rushed forward, but he was too late, Varney had taken the alarm, and
in a moment he regained his own room and fastened it securely on the inside.

     "We must have him," cried Charles.  "He cannot escape from that room. 
There is no other door, and the window is a good thirty feet from the garden
below.  Alarm the servants, we will soon open his door.  It can't be very
secure, for the lock was broken last night."

     As he spoke, Charles made a vigorous effort to open the door, but it
resisted as if it had been a part of the solid wall, while within the 
chamber
all was perfectly still, as if Mr. Smith had quite satisfied himself by
shutting out his assailants, and meant to take no further notice of them.

     "This is strange," said the doctor, "but we shall soon find out what he
means by it.  The door must be forced as quickly as possible."

     Edwin ran down stairs by his father's orders to arouse some of the men
servants, besides getting some weapon or tool by the assistance of which the
door might be forced, and he soon returned with several of the men, and one
armed with the identical crow-bar that had been used with such effect on the
preceding evening.  They brought lights with them too, so that the capture 
of
Mr. Smith appeared to be no longer a matter of doubt with such a force 
opposed
to him.

     "Now," cried Sir George, "do not mind what mischief you do, my men, so
that you break open the door of that room, and quickly too."

     People somehow are always glad to be engaged in anything that has a
destructive look about it, and when the servants heard that they might break
away at the door as much as they liked, they set about it with a vengeance
that promised soon to succeed in the object.

     The door yielded with a crash.

     "Come on, come on.  Yield yourself," cried Sir George, and he rushed 
into
the room followed by his sons and by Dr. North.

     There was no Mr. Smith there.

     "Escaped," said Dr. North.

     "Impossible, -- impossible! and yet this open window.  He must be lying
dashed to pieces below, for no one could with safety drop or jump such a
height.  Run round to the garden some of you, at once."

     "Stop," said Charles.  "There is no occasion.  He has had ample time to
escape.  Look here."

     Charles pointed out the end of a thick rope, firmly fastened to the 
ledge
of the window, and by which it was quite clear any one could safely descend
into the garden, it only requiring a little nerve to do so with perfect 
ease.

     "This has all been prepared," said Dr. North.

     "Still," cried Sir George, "I will not give the affair up.  Mind I 
offer
a reward of twenty guineas to any one of my household who succeeds in 
catching
Mr. Smith."

     "Lor, sir! what has he done?" said a groom.

     "Never you mind what he has done.  Bring him in, and you shall have the
reward."

     "Very good, sir.  Come on, Dick, and you Harry; let's all go, and you
know it will be all the pleasanter to share the reward among us.  Come on."

     Thus stimulated by their companion, the servants ran out of the house
into the moonlit park in search of Varney the Vampyre.

 Next Time: The funeral. -- A Strange Incident.




                             CHAPTER CXCII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 209]

THE FUNERAL. -- A STRANGE INCIDENT.


     It was all very well for Sir George Crofton to offer his twenty guineas
for the taking of Mr. Smith, and nothing could be more legitimate than his
servants making active exertions to endeavour to earn that amount of money,
but the really succeeding in doing so was quite another thing.

     To be sure they went out into the park, and did the best to catch him,
and being well acquainted with every turn and every pathway within it, they
considered they had a fair chance of succeeding, but after their pains they
were at length obliged to give up the affair as a bad job, after an hour or
two's most active search.

     While they were away though, there was something that occurred at the
Grange which gave a great additional shock to Sir George and his sons.

     It will not fail to be remembered that the first door they saw move 
while
they were keeping watch and ward in the moonlit gallery was the door of the
chamber in which lay the corpse of Clara, who had met with so melancholy an
end.                  

     This circumstance recurred to them all with fearful force when they 
felt
convinced that the now more suspected Mr. Smith had really and truly made 
his
escape.

     Upon proceeding to that room of the dead, Dr. North being first, they
found some difficulty in opening the door, but upon using force they
succeeded, when to their absolute horror they saw that the dead body was 
lying
upon the floor close to the door, and that it had been the obstruction to
moving it.

     Dr. North would fain have spared the feelings of Sir George this
affecting sight, but the baronet was so close behind him that he could not 
do
so.

     "Oh, God!" cried the father, "my child, my child."

     "Take your father away, boys, for heaven's sake," said Dr. North to the
two young men; "this is no sight for him to see."

     It appeared too as if it was no sight for any one to see unmoved, for
both Charles and Edwin stood like statues gazing at it, and for a time
incapable of motion.

     "My sister-- is it indeed my sister?" said Charles.

     The doctor fairly closed the door upon them all, and turned them so out
of the room.  Then he having professionally lost all dread of the dead, 
lifted
the body upon the bed again, and disposed of it properly, after which, 
without
saying a word, he walked down to the dining-room.

     "Tell me, tell me," said Sir George "what does all this mean?"

     "Do not ask me," replied Dr. North, "I cannot tell you; I confess I do
not know what advice to give you, or indeed what to say to you."

     The old man rested his head upon his hands, and wept bitterly, while 
his
two sons sat looking at each other perfectly aghast, and unable to think
anything of a rational import concerning the most mysterious proceedings 
that
had taken place.
               
               *             *              *              *

     Let our readers then suppose that a week has passed away, and that the
morning has arrived when the body of Clara is to be placed in a vault
appropriated as the resting place of the Croftons, beneath the church that 
was
close at hand.

     During that time nothing whatever had been heard of Mr. Smith.  He 
seemed
to have completely disappeared from the neighbourhood as well as from the
Grange-house.

     Fortunately, although Sir George had offered twenty guineas for the
apprehension of Mr. Smith to his servants, he had said nothing of the cause
why he offered such a reward, and the neighbourhood was left to its own
conjectures upon the subject.

     Those conjectures were of course sufficiently numerous, but it was 
quite
agreed between Sir George, Doctor North, and the two sons that nothing more
should be said upon the subject.

     They of course did not wish
          "To fill the ear of idle curiosity"
with such a tale as they might tell, but had a thousand reasons, each good 
and
substantial of its kind, for withholding.

     Young Ringwood was sufficiently recovered to be about, and to have told
him the story that widowed his heart.  He fell into a profound melancholy
which nothing could alleviate, and as his recovery went on, he asked
permission to remain at the Grange.

     Sir George, and indeed all the Crofton family, gladly pressed him to
remain with them as long as he would do so, for it was some alleviation of
their own distress to have him about them.

     He begged permission to be present at the funeral, and it is of that
funeral we have now to speak, for it took place on that day week on which 
the
vampyre had first taken up his dreadful residence at the old Grange-house,
where all before had been so happy.

     The church, as we have remarked, was not very distant, and a mournful
procession it was, consisting of the funeral equipages, followed by Sir 
George
Crofton's carriage, that at twelve o'clock in the day started to place the
youngest and the fairest of the name of Crofton that had ever reposed in the
family vault.

     The whole neighbourhood was in a state of commotion, and by the time 
the
funeral cortege reached the churchyard, there was not a person capable of
being out, for some miles around, that was not congregated about the spot.

     The old church bell tolled a melancholy welcome to the procession, and
the clergyman met the corpse a the entrance of the graveyard, and preceeded 
it
to the church, where it was placed by the altar while he made an impressive
prayer.

     This brief ceremony over, the coffin was carried to the part of one of
the aisles, where upon the removal of a large stone slab, the resting-place 
of
the Croftons was visible.

     "I have not looked upon these stone steps," said Sir George, "since my
poor wife went down there in the sleep of death."

     "Compose yourself," whispered Dr. North, who was present.  "You ought
not, sir, to have been present at such a scene as this."

     "Nay, it surely was my duty to follow my own child to her last
resting-place."

     The body was lowered into the vault, and the funeral service was read
impressively over the cold and still remains of Clara.

     "All is over," said the doctor.

     "Yes," faltered Sir George; "all is over.  Farewell, my dear child, but
not a long farewell to thee; this blow has nearly stricken me into the 
grave."

     "Leaning on the arm of his son Charles, who as well as Edwin was deeply
affected, the old man now allowed himself to be led from the church.  He met
at the door Will Stephens, the sexton, who seemed desirous of speaking to 
him.

     "What is it, Will?"

     "Will your honour have some fresh sawdust put down in the vault.  It
wants it, Sir George; there aint been any put in for many a long day."

     "Very well.  It will be ready for me when I go.  It won't be long 
before
the vault is again opened."

     "Oh, do not say that, father," said Edwin.  "Do not leave us; think 
that
if you have lost one child who loved you, you have others who ought to be as
dear to you."

     "That's right, Edwin," said the doctor.

     Sir George made no distinct reply to this, but he pressed the hand of
his son, and looked kindly upon him, to signify that he felt the full 
justice
of what he had just said, so they had hopes that time would soon produce its
usual effects upon that feeling which of all others is, while it lasts, the
most poignant, at the same time that it is the most evanescent -- grief for
the dead.

     And well it is that it should be so, otherwise we should be a world of
weepers and mourners, for who is there that has not felt the pang of losing
some fond heart in which we have garnered up the best affections of human
nature.

     Emma since her sister's death had been terribly broken down in spirit,
and when they all got home to the Grange, they found her looking so ill, 
that
the old baronet took Dr. North on one side, and said to him in tones
expressive of the deepest anguish, --

     "Am I to lose both my girls?"

     "Oh no-- no; certainly not," was the decided reply.  "Why, my old 
friend,
you used to be a man of great moral courage.  Where has it all gone to now?"

     "It is in the grave of my child."

     "Come, come, you must for your own sake, as well as for the sake of
others, who are near and dear to you, rouse yourself from this state of 
mental
torpor, as I may call it.  You can do so, and it is worthy of you to make 
the
effort.  Only think what would have been your situation if you had had but 
one
child, and that had been snatched away from you; but you have yet three to
comfort you, and yet you talk despairingly, as if every tie that bound you 
to
the world had been suddenly burst asunder."

     After this Sir George Crofton was almost ashamed to make such an
exhibition of his grief, and whatever his thoughts were he kept them to
himself, as well as exercising a much greater control over his voice, and 
the
external expression of the feelings, which were still busy at his heart.

     The despondency of Ringwood was great.  He could not help fancy that if
he had not met with the unlucky accident in the ravine, Clara would have 
been
saved, and in some obscure way to his mind, the circumstances seemed to be
connected together.  He could not account either for the loss of her
miniature, which he had been in the habit of wearing but which he missed 
upon
his convalescence, so that he was irresistibly led to the conclusion that 
some
unfriendly hands had been about him during his insensibility.

     So highly did he prize the miniature, that he offered a sum of money,
exceeding its intrinsic value by twenty times, for its recovery and pledged
himself to make no inquiry as to how it came into the possession of the 
party
who should restore it to him; but for all that it was not forthcoming.

     The reader of this narrative knows very well in whose possession it 
was.
Varney the Vampyre had possessed himself of it in the ravine, when he saw 
the
young bridegroom lying insensible at his feet, and he kept it, although why 
he
did so does not as yet appear, for surely the sight of it could only remind
him of one of his victims; but then Varney had other thoughts and feelings
than he used to have.

     Alas, what a thousand pities it was that the ocean had presented him to
the two brothers?  Why did he not sink -- why did not some wave hide him 
from
their observation?  What misery would have been spared to them, and to all
dear to them.  And what misery would have been spared to the wretched Varney
himself!

     It is true that he had given expression to sentiments, and declared
intentions which would go far to prove that he had for ever given up and got
rid of all human feelings and influences, but has he really so got rid of 
such
feelings?  It is a question which time alone can answer.

     We shall soon see in his now very short career whether he is most to
suffer or to inflict suffering, and what will be the result of his new
principles of action -- those principles which he had in the despair and the
agony of his heart painted to himself as the main springs of a combined
existence, he had with such vain and such fruitless perseverance strove to 
rid
himself of.  It was sad -- very sad, indeed, that such a being could not die
when he chose, the poor privilege of all.

 Next Time: The Strange Visitor to the old Church at Night.




                             CHAPTER CXCIII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 210]

THE STRANGE VISITOR TO THE OLD CHURCH AT NIGHT.


     The request of Will Stephens to be allowed to put some sawdust in the
vault of the Croftons, was one of those regular things that he always
propounded to any one who had a vault opened beneath the old church, and he
generally made a very good thing of it.

     People were always too much taken up with thinking of the loss of the
relation who had just been placed in that dismal repository, to think much 
of
a guinea to Will for a shilling's worth of sawdust, and if they did ever
intimate that they thought it rather too much, he always had his answer 
ready
at the tip of his tongue.

     "How should you like, sir, or madam, as the case may be, to go into a
vault among the dead, to lay the sawdust for 'em."

     That argument was generally conclusive, and Will would get his guinea.

     With Sir George Crofton he was quite sure and safe, so he had no 
scruples
upon the subject, and the little bit of sawdust he meant to carry in when he
had time, was more for the say of the thing, than for any utility it was at
all likely to be of, but then as he said, --

     "Where's the odds, the dead 'uns can't see it, and living 'uns won't go
to see it, so it does very well, and I pockets my guinea, which does better
still, for after all a sexton's aint the most agreeable life in the world, 
and
he ought to be paid well; not that I care much about it, being used to it, 
but
there was a time when I had my qualms, and I've had to get over 'em the best
way I could, somehow, if I am now all right."

     These were Will's arguments and reflections to himself before night, 
when
he meant to go and place the little bag of saw-dust in the Croftons' family
vault.

     But, before we follow Will Stephens on his saw-dust expedition, as we
intend to do, we wish first to draw the attention of the reader to another
circumstance, the relation of which to Will Stephen's proceedings will very
shortly appear indeed.

     As the night came on there was some appearance of stormy weather.  The
wind blew in a strange, gusty and uncertain manner, shifting about from 
point
to point of the compass in an odd way, as though it had not made up its mind
from whence to blow.  The most weather-wise personages of the neighbourhood
were puzzled, for just as they prognosticated one species of weather from 
the
particular direction whence the wind came, it shifted and came from some 
other
quarter very nearly directly opposite.

     This was extremely provoking, but at all events it was generally agreed
that the moon would not on that night, shed its soft light upon the earth.

     How far they were mistaken in this surmise we shall presently see.

     Will Stephens had an opinion, from certain admonitory symptoms arising
from his corns, that it would rain; so he delayed going to the church until 
he
should see what sort of weather it was going to be, inwardly deciding that 
it
would be a capital excuse not to go at all that night if the rain should 
come
down pretty sharply.

     This period of indecision he passed at a public house, known as the 
Blue
Lion, the charms of the excellent ale of that establishment materially
assisting him in coming to the conclusion that if it should rain ever so
little it would be better to put off his job until the morning.

     Now it was not that Will was afraid that he hesitated.  He was too used
to death to feel now any terrors of fear.  It was nothing but the ale.  Why
then was the hurry?  Simply that the flat stone which was over the vault of
the Croftons was left unfastened until the aforesaid saw-dust was placed
within the receptacle of the dead, and the next day was Sunday, so that the
job must be finished before the service should commence.

     At night, therefore, or very early the following morning, Will must 
seem
to earn his guinea by going to the vault.  He did not like to venture saying
he had been and yet neglect going, for he knew there were too many gossips
about the village to make that safe.

     While he is however regaling himself at the ale house, another person
totally, to all appearance, heedless of wind and threatening rain, is abroad
in the neighbourhood of the church.

     A tall figure enveloped in a large murky looking cloak, is moving 
slowly
past the few cottages in the immediate vicinage of the church, and so
noiselessly that it looks like a spirit of the dead rather than a living
person.

     It was unseen by any one, for it was a time of the night -- half-past
eleven -- now at which few persons in that little quiet place were abroad, 
and
as we have said, Will Stephens, perhaps the only inhabitant who had any real
business to be abroad at such an hour, was still solacing himself at the 
Blue
Lion with the ale that seemed to get better every glass he took.

     The figure moved on at a slow and steady pace among the old tomb stones
that lay so think [sic] around in the circuit of the church-yard, until it
reached the church itself, and then it walked slowly around the sacred
edifice, looking with a curious eye at the windows that presented themselves
to observation, and apparently scanning the height from the ground.

     Finally he paused at a rugged-looking part of the wall, and commenced,
with great muscular power and most wonderful agility, climing [sic] up to 
one
of the windows.

     To look at that wall it would have seemed that nothing human could
possibly have succeeded in ascending it, and yet this stranger, catching at
asperities which scarcely seemed to be such, did, with a wonderful power and
strength, drag himself up until he grasped an iron bar, close to the window
immediately above him, and then he had a firm hold.

     After this his progress was easy, assuming that his object was merely 
to
get up to the window of the old church, for he stood upon the narrow ledge
without in a few moments.

     There was a slight noise, it was of the breaking of a pane of glass, 
and
then the stranger introduced his hand into the church, and succeeded in
removing a rude primitive looking fastening which held the window in its
place.

     In another moment he disappeared from external observation within the
sacred building.

     What could he want there at such an hour, and who was he?  Did he
contemplate disturbing the repose of the dead with some unhallowed purpose?
Was robbery his aim?

     Let us be patient, and probably we shall soon enough perceive that some
affairs are in progress that require the closest attention, and which in the
vaults are calculated to fill the reflecting mind with the most painful
images, and awake sensations of horror at the idea that such things can 
really
be, and are permitted tacitly by Heaven to take place on the beautiful earth
destined for the dwelling place of man.

 Next Time: Will Stephen's Visit to the Family Vault with the Saw-dust, and
 What He Saw There.




                             CHAPTER CXCIV. [sic]

                               [Chapter 211]

WILL STEPHEN'S VISIT TO THE FAMILY VAULT WITH THE SAW-DUST, AND WHAT HE SAW
THERE.


     Will Stephens waited at the ale-house much longer than he intended.  To
be sure the rain cleared off, but what of that?  It was not a circumstance
that made the ale anything worse, and so he waited to drink it with a gusto
that improved each glass amazingly, and then some of those who were present 
--
jolly topers like himself -- began to laugh and to say, --

     "Ah, Will, you may as well poke that bag of saw-dust into some corner;
you won't do anything with it to-night, old fellow, we know."

     Now, some people get good tempered and complying when they have had the
drop too much, and others again, get partcularly obstinate and 
contradictory.
Will of the two, certainly had more pretensions to belong to the latter 
class
than the former, so when he heard such a prophecy concerning his movements 
and
knew it was all an assumption based upon the ale he had drank, he felt
indignant.

     "Not go!" he cried.  "Not go.  You may fancy if you please that I will
not go, but you will find yourselves mistaken, I will go."

     "What, so late."

     "What's the odds to me.  Any of you now would be frightened out of your
lives to set foot in the old church at such a time as this, I know; but I'm
none of the timid sort, I'm afraid of nobody living, and it aint likely that 
I
am now going to be afraid of anybody dead."

     "Then you really will go."

     The only reply that he made to this was to finish off the glass of ale
that was before him, shouldering the bag of saw-dust, and sally out into the
open air.  Will Stephens felt highly indignant and touchy about his honour,
and as he had said he would go and then somebody chose to imply a doubt 
still,
he was grievously offended.

     When he got out, he found that the night was anything but an inviting
one.  He was still sober enough to see that, and to feel that although the
heavy rain had ceased, there was a little disagreeable misty sort of vapour 
in
the air.

     He staggered at the first turning he came to, for rather an 
uncomfortable
gust of wind blew in his face, carrying along with it such a shower of small
cold rain that he was, or fancied himself to be, wet through in a moment.

     "Pleasant, this," thought Will, "but I won't go back to be laughed at."

     As for the saw-dust he was carrying, its weight was by no means any 
great
consideration for it was just as light as it could be.

     "No, I won't go back-- back indeed, not I; they would make me stand a 
pot
of ale to a certainly if I were to go back, and besides it would be all over
the parish tomorrow that Will Stephens after he got half way to the church 
was
afraid to go any further.  Confound the small rain, it pricks like pins and
needles."

     Nothing is more sobering than rain, and as he, Will, gradually got
saturated with the small aquaeous particles, the effect of the strong ale as
gradually wore off, until by the time the dim, dusky outline of the church
rose before him he was almost as sober as need be.

     "Ah," he said, "here I am at last at any rate.  I do hate this sort of
rain, you can hardly make up your mind that it is raining at all, and yet
somehow you get soaked before you know where you are.  It's just like going
through a damp cloud, that it is, and yet somehow or another, I don't much
mind it; I'm earning a guinea easy enough.  Ha, ha!"

     This was by no means an unpleasant reflection.

     "Yes," he added, "I am earning a guinea easily enough that's quite 
clear,
but then it's not everybody who would, for a guinea, go into anybody's 
family
vault at such a time.  By-the-by, I wonder now what the time is exactly."

     Scarcely had Will spoken those words when the old church-clock struck
twelve.

     It was a very serious, deliberate sort of clock that, and it took a 
long
time to strike twelve, and Will listened with the greatest attention with 
the
hope of persuading himself that it was only eleven, but there could be no
mistake, twelve it was.

     "Really," he said, "is it so late, well, I didn't think---"

     Will stood within the porch of the church door, and he gave a sort of
shiver, and then, with the bag of sawdust in his hand, he stopped to listen
attentively, for he thought he heard a slight sound.

     "What was that, eh? what-- I though, nay, I am sure I heard something;
it's very odd-- very odd indeed."

     As if then to afford Will an excuse for resolving the sound to 
something
else, the wind at this moment came in such a sudden gale round the ancent
[sic] edifice, that quite congratulated himiself [sic] he was within the 
porch
and protected from its fury, and besides it to his mind was a sufficing
explanation of the noise he had heard.

     "Some of the old doors," he muttered, "rattled by the wind, that's all.
Now I suppose we shall have a clear night after all the rain.  Such a gale
will soon blow off the damp clouds."

     Will was right.  The gale, for a gale it was, blew from the north, and
away went the rain clouds as if a curtain had been drawn aside by some
invisible hand.

     After some rummaging Will found in his pocket the key of the church; it
was not the key of the principal door, but of a smaller side entrance, at
which the officials, who required at all times free ingress and egress, made
application.  The little arched door creaked upon its hinges and then Will
stood in a sort of vestibule, for another door that was never fast had to be
opened before he could be fairly said to be within the church.

     This second door was covered with green baize, and could be opened and
shut very noiselessly, indeed.

     Will Stephens stood in the vestibule until he had got a small lantern 
out
of one pocket, and some matches from another.  Then, in a few moments he had 
a
light, and once again shouldering the bag of sawdust, he pushed open the 
inner
door, and stood in the church.

     It might have been fancy-- nay, he felt certain, it could be nothing
else-- but he thought as he opened the door that a faint sort of sigh came
upon his ears.

     Fancy or not, though, it was an uncomfortable thing at such an hour, 
and
in such a place too, and he had never before heard anything of the sort upon
his visits to the church, and he had visited it at all hours, many and many 
a
time.

     "It's odd," he said, "it's uncommonly odd, I never felt so 
uncomfortable
in the church before.  I-- I never used to mind coming to it in the middle 
of
the night.  But now, I-- eh? -- what was that?"

     Again an odd sort of noise came upon his ears, and he dropped the bag 
of
sawdust.

     All was still again, save the regular roar of wind, as it swept round 
the
sacred building, and although Will Stephens stood for nearly ten minutes in 
an
attitude of listening, he heard nothing to augment his terrors.  But let an
impulse once be given to fear, and it will go on accumulating material from
every trivial circumstance.  The courage of the sexton was broken down, and
there was no knowing, now, what tricks his awakened imagination might play
him.

     He began to wish he had not come, and from that wish, to think that he
might as well go back, only shame forbade him, for it would be easily known 
on
the morrow, that he had not placed the sawdust in the vault, and lastly, he
began to think that some one might be playing him a trick.

     This last supposition, probably, had more effect in raising his courage
than any preceding one.  Indignation took possession of him, and he no 
longer
thought of retreating.  He went forward at once, and fell over the bag of
sawdust.

     "Murder!" shouted Will.

     The moment he did so, he recollected what it was that had occasioned 
his
fall, and being ashamed of himself he called out impulsively, as if somebody
was there to hear him, --

     "No-- no, it's only the sawdust.  No-- no."

     He rose to his feet again, heartily ashamed of his own fears.  Luckily,
his lantern had not been broken or extinguished in his fall, and now, 
without
another word, he prepared himself to execute the work he came to do, and 
leave
the church to its repose as quickly as possible.

     At one end of the church, the southern end, there was a large window,
which might be said to light the whole of the interior, for the little 
windows
at the sides were more ornamental than useful, being nothing but lattices; 
and
across this window was drawn a heavy cloth curtain, so that when the sun 
shone
too brightly upon the congregation on a summer's day, it could be wholly or
partially excluded upon a sign from the clergyman.

     The curtain was drawn close on the window now, at night, and Will just
glanced up to it, as he walked on towards the aisle where the opening to the
family vault of the Crofton's was situated.

     "All's right," he said, "what a fool I have been, to be sure."  Upon my
word I might have saved frightening myself all night, and some people would
too, but that's not my way of doing business.  So here we are, all right.  
The
door on one side, so that I have just room enough to go down into the vault.
Oh! when one comes to think of it, it was rather a melancholy thing, the 
death
of such a young girl as she was, going to be married too.  Well, that's the
way the world goes."

     The stone steps leading down to the vault were rather steep, and Will
threw down the bag of sawdust first, in preference to carrying it, and then
with his lantern in his hand, he commenced his own descent.

     "That'll do," said Will, when he felt his feet upon the soft old 
sawdust
that was on the floor of the vault.  "That'll do-- now for it, I shall soon
have this job settled, and then I'll get home no faster than I can."

     Somewhow, or another, he felt very much inclined to talk; the sound of
his own voice, conversing, as he might be said to be, with himself, gave him 
a
sort of courage, and made the place not appear to be altogether so 
desperately
lonely as it really was.

     That, no doubt, was the feeling that brought forth so many indifferent
remarks from Will Stephens.  He held up his light to look round him, and 
turned
gradually upon his heels as he did so.

     The light shook in his hand.  The hair almost stood on end on his head 
--
his teeth chattered, and he tried to speak in vain, as he saw lying at his
feet, a coffin lid.

     It was new.  The nails that held the blue cloth upon it, were bright, 
and
fast -- the ate [plate?] shone like silver.  Yes, it was the lid of the 
coffin of
Miss Clara Crofton; but how came it off -- unsecured, and lying upon the 
floor
of the vault, while the coffin was in its proper niche?

     "Gracious goodness!" gasped Will at length.  "What does this mean?"

     The question was easy to ask, but most difficult to answer, and he 
stood
trembling and turning over in his mind all the most frightful explanations 
of
what he saw, that could occur to any one.

     "Has she been buried alive?  Have the body snatchers been after her?  
How
is it-- what-- what has happened?"

     Then it occurred to Will, that it would be just as well to look into 
the
coffin, and see if it was tenantless or not.  If it were, an thought [?] he
should know what to think, od [or?] if the dead body was there, then he 
could
only conclude that she had been buried alive, and had had just strength 
enough
to force open the coffin, and cast the lid of it on the floor of the vault,
and then to die in that horrible place.

     It required almost more courage than Will could muster, to go and look
into the coffin, for now that his usual indifference was completely broken
down, he was as timid as any stranger to graves and vaults would have been.
But curiosity is, after all, a most exciting passion, and that lent him 
power.

     "Yes," he said, "I-- I will look in the coffin, I shall have but a poor
tale to tell to Sir George Crofton, if I do not look in the coffin.  I-- I--
have nothing to be afraid of."

     He advanced with trembling steps, the light shaking in his hands as he
did so.  He reached the coffin, and with eyes unusually wide he looked in: 
it
was empty.

 Next Time: The Apparition in the Church. -- Will Stephens' Swoon. -- The
 Morning.




                             CHAPTER CXCV. [sic]

                               [Chapter 212]

THE APPARITION IN THE CHURCH. -- WILL STEPHENS' SWOON. -- THE MORNING.


     For some minutes, Will Stephens continued to gaze in the empty coffin, 
as
if there was something peculiarly fascinating in it, and most attractive, 
and
yet nothing was in it, no vestige even of the vestments of the dead.  If 
Clara
Crofton had herself risen, and left the vault, it was quite clear she had
taken with her the apparel of the grave.

     Will had thought that if he found the coffin empty, all his fears would
vanish, and that he should be able to come at once to the conclusion, that 
she
had become the prey of resurrectionists.  But new ideas, as he gazed at that
abandoned receptacle of the dead, began to creep across him.

     "I-- I-- don't know," he muttered, "but she may in a ghost-like kind of
way be going about.  I don't know whether ghosts is corpses or not.  I-- I
wish I was out of this."

     The idea of spreading the sawdust in the vault now completely left him;
all he thought of was to get away, and the dread that Clara Crofton was,
perhaps, hiding somewhere, and might come suddenly out upon him with a yell,
got so firm a hold of him, that several times he thought he should faint 
with
excess of terror.

     That would be too horrible," he said, "I am sure I should go mad-- mad-
-
mad."

     He retreated backward to the stairs, for the coffin, empty though it 
was,
held his gaze with a strange kind of fascinating power.  He thought that if 
he
turned round something would be sure to lay hold of him.  It was a most
horrifying and distressing idea that, and yet he could not conquer it.

     Of course, he must turn round, it would be an awkward thing to attempt
ascending the staircase short as it was, backward, so he felt the necessity 
of
turning his back upon the vault.

     "I-- I will do so," he thought, "and then make such a rush up the 
steps,
that I shall be in the church in a moment, I-- I can surely do that, and-- 
and
after all its [sic] nothing really to be afraid of-- it's only a matter of
imagination, after all! oh, yes, that's all, I-- I will do that."

     He put this notatble scheme into execution by turning suddenly round 
and
making a dash at the stairs, but as people generally do things badly when
they do them in a hurry, he stumbled when about half-way and felt himself at
the mercy of the whole of the supernatural world.

     "Have mercy on me," he cried, "I am going.  Have mercy on me."

     He had struck the lantern so hard against the stone stairs that he had
broken it into fragments, and now all was intense darkness around him.

     He gave himself up for lost.

     He lay, expecting each moment to feel some dead bony fingers clutching
him, and he only groaned, thinking that surely now his last hour was come;
and it is a wonder that his fancy, excited as it was, did not conjure up to
him the very effect he dreaded, but it did not do so, strange to say, and he
lay for full five minutes without anything occuring to add to his terrors.

     Then he began gradually to recover.

     "If-- if," he gasped, "I could but reach the church, I-- I think I 
should
be safe.  Yes, I should surely be safe in the body of the church.  Have 
mercy
on me, good ghosts; I never harmed any of you, I-- I respect you very much,
indeed I do.  Let me go, and-- I'll never say a light word of any of you
again, no, never, if I were to live for a thousand years."

     As he uttered these words, he crawled up the remaining stairs, and to 
his
great satisfaction, made his way fairly into the church.

     But then a new surprise, if it was not exactly a new fright, perhaps it
was something of both, awaited him.

     The curtain that had been, as he had observed when he was walking down
the aisle, closely drawn across the large south window was now drawn on one
side, so that a large portion of that window was exposed, and the north wind
having chased away by this time entirely the damp clouds, the moon was 
sailing
in a cloudless sky, and sending into the old church a glorious flood of 
light.

     "What a change," said Will Stephens.

     It was indeed a change; the church was as light as day, save in some
places where shadows fell, and they, in contrast to the silvery lightness of
the moonbeams, were of a jetty blackness.

     But still, let the moon shine ever so brightly, there is not that
distinctness and freshness of outline produced as in the direct daylight.  A
strange kind of hazy vapour seems to float between the eye and all objects -
-
an indistinctness and mysteriousness of aspect, which belongs not to the 
sun's
unreflected rays.  Thus it was, that although the church was illuminated by
the moon, it had a singular aspect, and would scarcely have been recognised 
by
any one who had only seen it by the mild searching light of day.

     But of course Will Stephens the sexton knew it well, and as he wiped 
the
perspiration from his face, he said, --

     "What a relief to get out of that vault and find now that the night has
turned out so fair and beautiful.  I-- I begin to think I have frightened
myself more than I need have done-- but it was that coffin-lid that did the
business; I wasn't my own man after that.  But now that I have got out of 
the
vault, I feel quite different-- oh, quite another thing."

     Suddenly, then, it occurred to him, that the curtain had been close on
the window, when he came into the church, and following upon that thought 
came
another, namely, that it could not very well remove itself from before the
casement, and that consequently some hands, mortal or ghostly, must have 
done
that part of the business.

     Here there was ample food again for all his fears, and Will Stephens
almost on the instant relapsed into his former trembling and nerveless 
state.

     "What shall I do?" he said;  "it aint all over yet.  What will become 
of
me?  There's something horrid going to happen, I feel certain, and that
curtain has only been drawn aside to let the moonlight come in for me to see
it."

     With a painful expectation of his eyes being blasted by some horrible
sight, he glared round him, but he saw nothing, although the dense little 
mass
of pews before him might have hidden many a horror.

     His next movement was to turn his eyes to the gallery, and all round it
he carried them until he came to the window again, but he saw nothing.

     "Who knows," he muttered, "who knows after all, but that the wind, in
some odd sort of way, may have blown the curtain on one side.  I-- I wish I
had the courage to go up to the gallery, and see, but I-- I don't think I
should like to do that."

     He hesitated.  He knew that it would sound well on the morrow for him 
to
be able to say that he went up, and yet it was rather a fearful thing.

     "A--hem!" he said at length, "is any one here?"

     As he made this inquiry, he took care to keep himself ready to make a
dart out at the door into the churchyard, but as there was no response to 
it,
he was a little encouraged.  The gallery staircase was close to where he
stood, and after the not unnatural hesitation of a few moments more, he
approached them, and began slowly to ascend.

     Nothing interrupted him, all was profoundly still, and at length he did
reach the south window, and he found that the curtain was most deliberately
drawn on one side, and that the window was fast, so th[at] no vagary of the
wind could have accomplished the purpose.

     "Now I'll go-- I'll go at once," he said, "I can't stand this any 
longer!
I'll go and alarm the village-- I'll-- I'll make a disturbance of some 
sort."

     "Awake!" said a deep, hollow voice.

     Will sunk upon his knees with a groan, and mechanically his eyes 
wandered
to the direction from whence the sound came, and he saw in a pew just 
beneath
him, and on which the moonlight now fell brightly, a human form.

     It wa lying in a strange huddled up position in the pew, and a glance
showed the experienced eyes of the sexton that it was arrayed in the 
vestments
of the dead.

     He tried to speak -- he tried to scream -- he tried to pray, but all 
was
in vain.  Intense terror froze up every faculty of his body, and he could 
only
kneel there with his face resting upon the front of the gallery, and glare
with aching eyes, that would not close for a moment, upon the scene below.

     "Awake!" said a deep, strange voice again, "awake."

     It was quite clear that that voice did not come from the figure in the
pew, but from some one close at hand.  The sexton soon saw another form.

     In the adjoining pew, standing upright as a statue, with one hand
pointing upwards to the window, where came in the moonlight, was a tall
figure, enveloped in a cloak.  It was from the lips of that figure, that the
sound came, so deeply, and so solemnly.

     "Sister," it said, "be one of us-- let the cold chaste moonbeams endow
thee with your new, and strange, and horrible existence.  Be one of us.  Be
one of us!  Hours must yet elaspe, ere the faint flash of morning will kill
the moonbeams.  There is time, sister.  Awake, be one of us."

     There was a passing cloud that swept for an instant over the face of 
the
moon obscuring its radiance, and the figure let its arm fall to its side.  
But
when the silvery beams streamed into the church, it again pointed to the
window.

     "'Tis done.  She moves," he said.  "I have fulfilled my mission.  Ha! 
ha!
ha!"

     The laugh was so terrific and unmirthful that it froze the very blood 
in
the veins of Will, and he thought he was surely at that moment going mad.

     But still he did not close his eyes, still he moved not from the 
position
which he had first assumed when the horrible noise me[t] his ears.

     "T'is [sic] done," said the figure, and the arm that had been
outstretched was let fall to his side.

     Will Stephens looked in the pew, where he had seen what appeared to be 
a
corpse.  It had altered its position.  He saw it move and waive its arms 
about
strangely and deep sighs came from its lips.  It was a dreadful sight to 
see,
but at length it rose up in the grave clothes, and moved to the door of the
pew.

     The figure in the adjoining pew opened the door and stood on one side,
and the revivified corpse passed out.

     Slowly and solemnly it passed down the aisle.  It reached the door at
which Will Stephens had entered, and then it passed away from his sight.  
The
tall figure followed closely, and Will Stephens was alone in the church.

     What could he do?  How could he give a sufficient alarm?  Would the two
horrible personages return or not?  Alas! poor Will Stephens, never was an
unhappy mortal sexton in such frightful tribulation before.  He knelt and
shook like an aspen[.]  At length a lucky thought entered his head.

     "The bell.  The bell," he cried, all at once finding his voice.  "To 
the
bell."

     He sprung to his feet, for what he was now about to do, did not involve
the necessity of going down again into the body of the church.  There was a
narrow staircase at the corner of the gallery, leading to the belfry.  It 
was
up that staircase that Will now struggled and tore.

 Next Time: The Alarm From the Belfry. -- The Beadle in a Quandary.




                             CHAPTER CCX. [sic]

                               [Chapter 213]

THE ALARM FROM THE BELFRY. -- THE BEADLE IN A QUANDARY.


     "The belfry," cried Will Stephens.  "Oh! if I could but reach the
belfry."

     He went stumbling on, now falling, then gathering himself up again to
renewed [exertions], for the stairs were steep and narrow, and although the
little church tower was by no means very high yet the place where the bell
hung was not to be reached in a moment.

     Perseverance, however, will do wonders[,] and it was reached at last.
Yes, he stood panting in a little square building in the very centre of 
which
hung a thick rope.  It was the means of tolling the bell.  To seize it was 
the
work of a moment.  The bell swung round and its iron tongue gave forth a 
loud
and stunning sound.  Again and again -- bang -- bang -- bang! went the bell,
and then feeling that at all events he had given an alarm, Will Stephens
turned to retrace his steps."

     He was half stupified by his previous fears.  The noise of the bell, so
close as he had been to it, had been stunning and bewildering, and Will
Stephens reeled like a drunken man.  The ale too might have a little to do
with that, but certainly he made a false step, and down he went head 
foremost
from top to bottom of those old steep, narrow belfry stairs.

            *               *               *               *

     Will Stephens was right when he considered that the tolling of the bell
would give an alarm.  Most persons in the neighbourhood were awakened by it,
and they listened to the seven or eight pealing sounds in surprise.  What
could they mean?  Who was doing it?  It could not be fire.  Oh dear no.  The
alarm would not leave off it it were.  Somebody dead -- ah, yes, it was some
great person in the state dead, and the news had been brought there, and so
the bell was tolled, and we shall hear all about it in the morning.  And so
those who had been awakened went to sleep again, and the unhappy sexton was
left to his fate at the foot of the little stairs leading up to the belfry,
where he had gone with so much trouble, and produced so little effect.

     The long weary hours of the night crept on, and at last the faint dawn 
of
early morning showed itself upon the ocean, and in faint streaks of light in
the glowing east.

     The fishermen began to ply their hazardous and hardy trade.  The birds 
in
the gardens, and in the old lime and yew trees that shaded the church-yard,
shook off their slumbers.  Gradually the light advanced, and a new day 
began.

     But there lay poor Stephens, the victim of what he had seen and heard 
in
the old church, and he was doomed to lie some time longer yet.

     There was a Mr. Anthony Dorey, who was parish beadle, and he had
awakened, and heard the sound of the tolling of the well-known bell.

     "I say, mother Dorey," he had said to better half, "what's that?"

     "How should I know, idiot," was the polite rejoinder.

     "Oh, very good[.]"

     "You had better get up and see.["]

     "Oh dear no.  It's no business of mine; Master Wiggins is bell-ringer; 
I
dare say it's something though."

     This was a wise conclusion for the beadle to come to, and he turned to 
go
to sleep again, which was wise likewise, only more easy in the conception 
than
in the execution, for his mind was more disturbed than he had though it
possible anything could disturb it, by the tolling of the bell.

     Whenever he found himself just going off to sleep, he jumped awake 
again
quite wide, crying, --

     "Eh! eh!  Was that the bell?"

     This sort of thing, varied by a great number of punches in the ribs 
from
Mrs. Dorey, went on until the morning had sufficiently advanced to make it
quite light enough to see objects with ordinary distinctness, and then,
fancying that all his attempts to sleep would be futile, the vexed beadle
rose.

     "I can't sleep, that's a clear case," he said, "so I will go and see 
what
the bell was tolled for at such an odd time of the night.  The more I think 
of
it, the more I don't know what to think."

     Full of this resolution, he went post haste to Mr. Wiggins's and 
knocked
loudly at his cottage door.

     "Hillo! hillo! Wiggins."

     "Well," said Wiggins, looking out of his bed-room window with his head
picturesquely adorned by a red night-cap, "Well what's the matter now?"

     "That's what I want to know.  Why did you toll the bell in the middle 
of
the night?"

     "I toll the bell!"

     "Yes, to be sure, I heard it."

     "Yes, and I heard it too, but it was none of my tolling, and if I had 
not
been rather indisposed, Mr. Dorey, I should have got up myself and seen what
it was all about.  As it is you find me cleaning myself rather early."

     "I'll wait for you, then," said Dorey.

     Wiggins soon made his appearance, and he and Dorey walked off together 
to
the church, much pondering as they went, upon the mysterious circumstance 
that
took them there, for if neither had rung the bell they could not think who
had, for although the name of Will Stephens certainly occurred to them both,
they thought it about one of the most unlikely things in the world that he
would take the trouble to perform upon the great bell in the middle of the
night, when it was none of his business to do so under any circumstances
whatever.

     "Nonsense," said the beadle; "I hardly ever knew him do a very civil
thing."

     "Nor I either, so you may depend, neighbour Dorey, it's not him."

     "It's a great mystery, neighbour Wiggins.  That's what it is, and 
nothing
else."

     "I hope it don't bode none of us no harm, that's all.  Times are quite
bad enough, without anything happening to make 'em worse."

     This sentiment, as any grumbling one always is, was acceded to by the
beadle, and so they went on conversing until they reached the church door; 
and
then the surprise of finding the smaller entrance open struck them, and they
stood staring at each other for some moments in profound silence.

     "There's somebody here," said Wiggins at last.

     "In course."

     "What shall we do, Mr. Dorey?  Do you think it's our duty to-- to go in
and see who it is, or-- or run away?  You know I aint a constable, but you
are, so perhaps it alters the case so far as you are concerned, you see."

     "Not at all; you are a strong man, Mr. Wiggins, a very strong man; but
suppose we try to make some one answer us.  Here goes."

     The beadle advanced close to the threshold of the door, and in as loud 
a
tone of voice as he could command, he said, --

     "Ahem! -- ahem! -- Hilloa, hilloa! -- What are you at there? -- Come,
come, I'm down upon you."

     "What do they say?" inquired Wiggins.

     "Nothing at all."

     "Then, perhaps, it's nobody."

     "Well, do you know, if I thought that, I'd go in at once, like a 
roaring
lion-- I would-- and show 'em who I was-- ah!"

     "So would I-- so would .I" [sic]

     After listening for some short time longer, most intently, and hearing
nothing, they came to the conclusion, that although some one had evidently
been there, there was no one there now; so it would be quite safe to go into
the church, always taking care to leave the door open, so that, in the event
of any alarm, they could run away again, with all the precipitation in the
world.

     It certainly was not one of the most hazardous exploits in the whole
history of chivalrous proceedings to inter [sic] a church in day-light, as 
it
then was, in search of some one, who it was very doubtful was there.  But to
have seen the beadle and Mr. Wiggins, anybody would have thought them bound
upon an enterprise of life or death, and the latter the most likely of the
two, by a great deal.

     "Ahem!" cried Mr. Dorey again; "we are two strong, bold fellows, and we
have left our six companions-- all six feet high, at the door-- ahem!"

     No effect was produced by this speech, which Mr. Dorey fully intended
should strike terror into somebody, and after a few minutes search, they 
both
felt convinced that there was no one hidden in the lower part of the church,
and there was only the gallery to search.

     And yet that was a ticklish job, for the nearer they approached the
belfry, of course the nearer they approached the spot from whence the alarm
had been given.  It was therefore with rather a backwardness in going 
forward,
that they both slowly proceeded up the staircase, and finally reached the
gallery, where they saw no one; and much to their relief the want of any
discovery was.

     "It's all right," said the beadle.  "There's nobody here.  Oh, how I do
wish the rascals had only stayed, that's all.  I'd a shewn them what a 
beadle
was-- I'd a took 'em up in a twinkling-- I would.  Lord bless you, Mr.
Wiggins, you don't know what a desperate man I am, when I'm put to it, that
you don't."

     "Perhaps not, but there don't seem to be any danger."

     "Not the least.  Eh? eh? -- oh, the Lord have mercy upon us!  I give 
in--
what's that? -- take my everything, but, oh! spare my life-- oh! oh! oh!"

     This panic of the beadle's was all owing to hearing somebody give a
horrible groan -- such a groan that it was really dreadful to hear it.  Mr.
Wiggins, too, was much alarmed, and leant upon the front rail of the 
gallery,
looking dreadfully pale and wan.  The beadle's face looked quite of a purple
hue, and he shook in every limb.

     "I-- I thought I saw a groan," he said.

     "So-- so-- did-- I-- oh, look-- then don't you hear a horrible bundle 
up
in that corner.  Oh, mercy!  I begin to think we are as good as dead men--
that we are-- oh, that we are.  What will become of us? -- what will become 
of
us?"

     By this time, Will Stephens, who, the reader is aware, was there to 
make
the groan, had got up from the foot of the belfry-stairs, and he began to 
drag
hs bruised and stiffened frame towards the beadle and Mr. Wiggins, which 
they
no sooner perceived than they set off as hard as they could scamper from the
place, crying out for help, as if they had been pursued by a thousand 
devils.

     In vain Stephens called after them; they did not hear his voice, nor 
did
they stop in their headlong flight until they reached the door of the
clergyman, concerning whose power to banish all evil spirits into the Red 
Sea,
they had a strong belief, and as the reverend gentleman was at breakfast, 
the
first thing they both did was to rush in, and upset the tea-tray which the
servant had just brought in.

     Yes; that was what the parson said.  With all due respect for his 
cloth,
we cannot help recording the fact that the words at the commencement of this
chapter were precisely those that came from the lips of the reverend 
gentleman
upon the occasion of the sudden and rather alarming irruption of the beadle
and the bell-ringer into his breakfast parlour at the parsonage.

     "We beg your pardon, sir," said the beadle, "but----"

     "Yes, sir, we beg your pardon," add the bell-ringer, "but----"

     "What?" cried the parson, as he looked at the remains of his breakfast
lying upon the hearth-rug in most admired disorder at his feet.

     "The bell, sir-- the church-- the gallery-- a groan-- a ghost-- a lot 
of
ghosts."

     Such were the incoherent words that came, thick as hail, from the 
beadle
and the bell-ringer.  In vain the clergyman strove to get to the rights of 
the
story.  He was compelled to wait until they were both very nearly tired out,
and then he said, --

     "Very well, I don't understand, so you may both go away again."

     "But, sir----"

     "But, sir----"

     "If one of you will speak while the other listens I will attend, and 
not
otherwise.  This is Sunday morning, and I neither can, nor will waste any 
more
time upon you."

     Nothing is so terrible to a professed story teller, and the beadle was
something of that class, as to tell him you won't listen to him, so Mr. 
Dorey
at once begged that Wiggins would either allow him to tell what had 
happened,
or tell it properly himself.  Mr. Wiggins gave way, and the beadle as
diffusely as possible told the tale of the bell tolling, and the visit to 
the
church, with the awful adventure that there occurred.

     "What do you think of it, sir?" he concluded by asking.

     "I have no opinion formed as yet," replied the clergyman, "but I will
step down to the church now, and see."

     "You'll take plenty o' people with you, sir."

     "Oh dear no, I shall go alone.  I don't gather from what you have said
that there is any danger.  Your own fears, too, I am inclined to think, have
much exaggerated the whole affair.  I dare say it will turn out, as most of
such alarms usually do, some very simple affair indeed."

     The parson took his hat, and walked away to the church as coolly as
possible, leaving Mr. Dorey and Mr. Wiggins to stare at each other, and to
wonder at a temerity they could not have thought it possible for any human
being to have practised.

     But the clergyman was supported by a power of which they knew little--
the power of knowledge, which enabled him at once in his own mind to divide
the probable from the impossible, and therefore was it that he walked down 
to
the church fully prepared to hear from somebody a very natural explanation 
of
the mysterious bell-ringing in the night, which was the only circumstance 
that
made him think that there was anything to explain, for he had heard that
himself.

     When he reached the sacred building, he found the door open, as the
beadle and the bell-ringer had left it, and the moment he got into the body 
of
the church, he heard a voice say, --

     "Help! help! will nobody help me?"

     "Yes," he replied, "of course, I will."

     "Oh! thank Heaven!"

     "Where are you." [?]

     "Here, sir, I think that's your voice, Mr. Bevan."

     "Ah, and I think that's your voice, Will Stephens; I thought this would
turn out some very ordinary piece of business, so you are up stairs; and did
you ring the bell in the night?"

     "I did, sir."

     "Just so-- come down then."

     "I'm afraid I can't, sir, without some help.  I have had a very bad 
fall,
and although, thank God, no bones are broken, I am sadly shaken and bruised,
so that it is with great pain, sir, I can crawl along, and as for getting 
down
the stairs, why-- I-- I rather think I couldn't by myself, if there was a
hundred pound note waiting for me below, just for the trouble of fetching,
sir."

     "Very well, I'm coming, don't move."

     Mr. Bevan ascended the staircase, and without "a bit of pride," as Will
Stephens said afterwards, in telling the story, helped the bruised sexton 
down
the gallery steps to the body of the church, and then he made him sit down 
on
one of the forms, and tell him all that had happened, which Will did from
first to last, quite faithfully, not even omitting how he had stayed rather
late at the ale-house, and how terrified he had been by the curious events
that took place while he was in the church, ending by his fall from the 
stairs
leading up to the belfry.

     "Will, Will," said Mr. Bevan, "the ringing of the bell is good proof 
that
you have been in the belfry, but you will scarcely expect me to believe the
remainder of your dream."

     "Dream, sir?"

     "Yes, to be sure.  You surely don't think now, in broad daylight, that 
it
is anything else, do you?"

     "I-- I don't know, sir; of course, sir, if you say its a dream-- why--
why---"

     "There, that will do.  I will convince you that it was nothing more, or
else you will go disturbing the whole neighbourhood with this story, that it
is quite a mercy, I have first heard."

     "Convince me, sir?"

     "Yes; come with me to the vault."

     Will Stephens shrunk from this proposal and his fear was so manifest,
that Mr. Bevan was, at all events, convinced that he had told him nothing 
but
what he himself believed, and accordingly he felt still more anxious to rid
Will of his nervous terror.

     "You surely," he said, "cannot be timid, while I am with you.  Come at
once, and if you do not find that the late Miss Crofton, poor girl, is quiet
enough in her coffin, I promise you upon my sacred word, that I will never
cease investigating this affair, and bringing it to some conclusion.  Come 
at
once, before any curious persons arrive at the church."

     So urgent a request from the clergyman of the parish to Will Stephens,
the sexton of the parish, almost might be said to amount to a command, so 
Will
did not see how he could get out of it, without confessing an amount of rank
cowardice that even he shrunk from.

     "Well, sir," he said, "of course with you I can have no objection."

     "That's right.  Come along; there are means of getting a light into the
vestry; wait here a moment."

     Will would not wait; he stuck close by Mr. Bevan, who went into the
vestry, and soon procured a candle, lighted from materials he kept there 
under
lock and key; and they went together to the vault, the stone of which was 
just
as it had been left when Will emerged with so much fright.

     "I will go first," said Mr. Bevan.

     "Thank you, sir."

     The clergyman descended, and Will Stephens followed, trembling, about 
two
stairs behind him.  Little did he expect when he emerged from that vault
previous to his adventures in the church, that he should revisit it again so
quickly.  Indeed he had made a mental resolve that nothing should induce him
to go down those stairs again, and yet there he was actually descending 
them.

     So weak are the resolutions of mortals!

     "Needs must," thought Will, "when the--- parson, I mean, drives!"

     "Come on, Will," said Mr. Bevan.

     Will looked about him, but no coffin-lid was visible.  There was Miss
Crofton's coffin in its proper niche, with the lid on, and looking as calm 
and
undisturbed as any respectable coffin could look.  Will was amazed.  He 
looked
at the coffin, and he looked at the parson, and then he looked uncommonly
foolish.

     "Never mind it, Will," said Mr. Bevan, "never mind it, I say.  The 
story
need go no further.  You can keep your own counsel if you like.  You have 
come
here under the influence of strong ale, and you have gone to sleep most 
likely
in this very vault, and in your sleep, having a very vivid dream, you have
walked up into the gallery, and thence into the belfry, where no doubt you 
did
ring the bell under the influence of your dream; and then you fell down the
belfry stairs, I believe, as you say you did."

     "Ah!" said Will, "bless you, sir.  It may be so, but----"

     "You are not convinced."

     "Not quite, sir,"

     "Well, Will, you are quite right never to pretend to be convinced when
you are not.  I do not blame you for that, but in a short time, when the
effect of the affair has worn off, you will entertain my opinion."

     "I hope, sir, I may."

     "That will do.  Now the stone must be put over this vault."

     "Sir, if you wouldn't mind, sir."

     "What, Will?"

     "Staying a moment or two, while I empty the bag of sawdust on the 
floor,
sir, I shan't be a minute, no-- not half a minute, and then I shall have 
done
with the vault altogether I hope, sir."

     "Very well."

     Will set to work, and although at any other time he would have been
rather ashamed of letting Mr. Bevan see what a wonderfully small quantity of
sawdust made up a guinea's worth, superior considerations now prevailed, and
he would not have spared the clergyman's company on any account.

     "Now I've done, sir."

     "Very well, follow me."

     Will did not like to ask the clergyman to follow him, so in that
difficulty, for as to his remaining behind it was out of the question, he 
made
a rush and reached the church before Mr. Bevan could ascend two of the 
steps.
When that gentleman did reach the church he made no remark about the
precipitancy, and apparent disrespect of Will, for he put it down to its 
right
cause, but he left the church in order to make the usual preparations for 
the
morning service, which would now commence in an hour-and-a-half.

     Will walked home with his empty bag, for the little exercise he had had
sufficed to convince him that he was not so much hurt as he thought, and 
that
the stiffness of his limbs would soon pass away.

     "It's all very well," he said to himself, "for Mr. Bevan to talk about
dreams, but if that was one, nothing real, has ever, happened to me yet,
that's all."

 Next Time: The Young Lover's Midnight Watch.




                            CHAPTER CXCVIII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 215]

THE YOUNG LOVER'S MIDNIGHT WATCH.


     Did the clergyman really think what he said?  Had he no suspicions, 
that
after all there was a something more even than he was quite willing to admit
in the story told by Will Stephens?

     We shall see in good time, but at all events one thing is evident, that
the parson thought it good sound policy, and it was, to endeavour to nip the
thing in the head, and by ascribing it to a dream, put it down as a subject 
of
speculation in the place.

     He knew that nothing could be more dangerous than allowing any such 
story
to pass current as a wonderful fact, and well he knew that in a short time, 
if
such were the case, it would receive so many additions and so many
embelishments, that the mischief it might produce upon the mind of an 
ignorant
population might be extreme, and of a most regretful character indeed.

     All this he felt hourly, [?] and therefore Will Stephens' story was to 
be
put down as a dream.

     Now Mr. Bevan, it will be recollected, had urged Will to keep his own
counsel, and to say nothing of the affair to any one, but he had faint hopes
only that Will would do that, very faint hopes indeed, for after all he, 
Will,
was the hero of the story, and there would be a something extremely 
gratifying
in telling it, and in stating what he would have done, had not his foot
slipped as he came down the narrow stairs from the old belfrey, and so
completely stunned him by the fall.  Mr. Bevan therefore had very few if any
compunctions in adopting the course he did, which was, in the evening, when
there was no service at the church, to call at the Grange, to see Sir George
Crofton upon the subject.

     Mr. Bevan was always a welcome guest at the Grange, and he was on those
intimate and good terms with the family, that he could always call whenever
he pleased, so that a mere announcement of his presence by no means had the
effect of preparing Sir George for any communication.

     "Ah, Mr. Bevan," he said, when the clergyman entered the room, "I am 
glad
to see you."

     "And I to see you, Sir George."

     "You come to a house of mourning, sir.  But that will be the case here
for a long, long time.  Time may and will, no doubt, do much to assuage our
grief, but the blow is as yet too recent."

     Tears started to the eyes of Sir George Crofton, as he made this 
allusion
to his daughter, and he turned his head aside to hide such evidences of
emotion from the parson, from whom, however, he need have expected nothing 
but
the most friendly sympathy that one human being could bestow upon another.
Mr. Bevan was a man of refinement and consideration, and he let grief aways
have its way, seldom doing more than merely throw out, in the form of a
suggestion for consideration as it were, that death was not the great evil 
it
was thought to be.

     In such a way he generally succeeded in bring persons smarting under 
the
infliction of the loss of dear friends and relations much sooner to proper
sense of the subject, than if he had indulged in all the canting religious
exhortations that some divines think applicable to such occasions.

     Sir George Crofton was alone, for his two sons had gone for a stroll in
the grounds.  Ringwood who still remained with the family, was in the 
library,
where now he passed most of his time, in trying by reading to withdraw his
mind from a too painful and fixed contemplation of his loss.

     He was still weak, but might be considered now quite convalescent.

     "Pray be seated, Mr. Bevan," said Sir George.  "Believe me, I take it
very kindly of you to come so often."

     "Pray dear sir, don't say another word about it-- I-- I am very sorry 
to
feel myself obliged to allude to anything of an uncomfortable nature."

     "Think nothing of doing so, my friend.  Think nothing of it, I have a
master grief which drowns all others."

     "But it is concerning that master grief, sir, that I come to speak."

     "Indeed!"

     "Yes, sir, will you kindly hear me?"

     "Certainly, certainly."

     "You told me on the day following the melancholy death of your 
daughter,
as a friend, the peculiar circumstances attendant upon that death.  Now I do
not mean to say that what I am going to relate to you has any connection at
all with those circumstances, nor would I tell you what I come to tell at 
all,
were I not fearful that the same story with some of the usual exaggerations 
of
ignorance would reach you from other quarters, for it is not a matter
consigned to my bosom only, or there it should remain."

     "You alarm me."

     "That I feared, but deeply regret.  Listen to me, and remember always 
as
you do so, that I think the whole affair is a mere dream-- a disturbed
slumberer's vision-- nothing more."

     Sir George Crofton did listen with breathless eagerness, and Mr. Bevan,
without detracting anything or adding anything to the narative of Will
Stephens, told him the whole story just as Will had told it to him, 
concluding
by saying, --

     "That is all my dear sir, and I felt that my duty powerfully called 
upon
me to be your informant upon the subject, simply that we might be forewarned
against any coarse version of the story."

     Sir George drew a long breath.

     "More horrors!  More horrors!"

     "Nay, why should you say that?"

     "Is it not so?"

     "Nay I have already given my opinion, by saying, that I look upon the
whole affair as but the phantasma of dream."

     "Oh!  Mr. Bevan, do not trifle with me.  Is that really and truly your
opinion, sir, or only said from kindness to me."

     "It is the best opinion that I can come to."

     "I thank you, sir; I thank you.  Clara, Clara, my child, my child!"

     The old man was overcome with grief, and at the interesting moment,
Ringwood entered the room, with a book in his hand.  He was astonished, as
well he might be to see such a fearful relapse of grief on the part of Sir
George Crofton, and he looked from him to Mr. Bevan, and from Mr. Bevan to
him, for some few moments in silence, and then he said, --

     "Surely all here have suffered enough, and there is no new calamity 
come
upon this house."

     "Tell him all," cried Sir George; "tell him all.  It is fit that he
should know; he is one of us now, he loved my child, and loves her memory
still.  I pray you, Mr. Bevan, to tell all to Ringwood, for I have not the
heart to do so."

     "I wonder," said Ringwood, calmly, "to hear you speak thus.  I wonder 
to
see that any new grief can come so near to that which we have already
suffered.  The image of my lost one fills up each crevice of my heart.  I
shall listen to you Mr. Bevan with respect, but my grief, I fear is selfish,
and cannot feel more than its own miseries."

     Ringwood seemed to imagine that what the parson had to say referred to
something with which Clara had nothing to do; but when, as the story
proceeded, he found how intimately connected she was with the affair, his
cheek flushed for a moment, and then grew of a death-like paleness, and he 
sat
trembling and looking in the face of Mr. Bevan, as he proceeded with his 
most
strange relation.

     When he had concluded Ringwood gave a deep groan.

     "You are much affected, sir," said Mr. Bevan.

     "Crushed! crushed!" was the reply.  "Oh God!"

     "Nay now this is not manly, sir, you feel this thing too much; if you 
are
so crushed how can any one expect that from you is to proceed the necessary
exertion to prove that the story in all its particulars is but a falsehood?"

     Ringwood caught at this idea in a moment.

     "Exertion from me?" he said.  "What exertions would I not make to prove
such a horror to be but a creation of the fancy?  What would I not do!  What
would I not suffer?  You have warned me, sir.  Yes, I have a duty to do-- a
duty to Clara's memory; a duty to you Sir George, and a duty to myself, for
did I not love her, and does not her gentle image still sit in my inmost 
heart
enshrined?  I will prove that this most monstrous story is a delusion.  Bear
with me, gentlemen, I must think.  To-morrow you shall know more, but not
until to-morrow."

     He rose, and left the room.

     "What does he mean," said Sir George, vacantly.

     "I cannot tell you, sir; but wait until to-morrow.  Perhaps by then he
may have proposed some plan of action, that you or I may not think of.  You
will use your own discretion, about communicating the strange affair to your
sons or not, sir.  Upon such a point as family confidence, I never venture 
an
opinion.  Allow me to call upon you to-morrow morning, sir, when I hope to
find you in better spirits."

     The clergyman would not have been in such haste to leave Sir George; 
but
as he saw Ringwood leave the room; that young man made a sign to him, that 
he
wished to see him before he left, and accordingly Mr. Bevan was anxious to
know what it was he had to say to him.

     When he left Sir George, he asked a servant where Mr. Ringwood was, and
being told he was in the library, Mr. Bevan, being quite familiar with the
house, followed him there at once, and found him pacing that apartment in
great agitation, and with disordered steps.

     "Thank heaven you have come, sir," cried Ringwood, "tell me, oh, tell 
me,
what would you advise me to do, Mr. Bevan."

     "I think," replied the clergyman, "you have already half decided upon a
course."

     "I have, I have."

     "Then follow it, if it be such a one as in its result will produce a
conviction of the truth.  Do not, Mr. Ringwood, allow anything to turn you
aside from a course which you feel to be right; you will always find 
strength
enough to persevere if you have that strong conviction upon your What is 
your
plan?"

     "It is this night to watch in the church?"

     "Be it so; I will, if you like, keep watch with you."

     "Oh, no, no! let me be alone.  All I ask of you, sir, is to provide me
with the means of getting into the sacred edifice at midnight."

     "That I will do.  You shall have a private key that I have for my own
use; you can let yourself in without any one knowing of your presence.  But 
do
you think you have nerve enough to go alone? if you have the smallest doubt 
or
hesitation, let me accompany you."

     "No, no-- I thank you, but let me go alone, and say nothing of this to
Sir George.  I had it in my mind when I told him I would speak to him
to-morrow about what you had communicated.  I would fain, if these horrors 
be
really true, keep him in ignorance that I have verified them.  But if I keep
my night watch quite undisturbed, then he shall have the satisfaction of
knowing that it has been so kept.

     "You are right in that; I will send the key to you in the course of
another hour and remember I am at your service if you should alter your 
mind,
and wish for company.  Do not hesitate about disturbing my rest."

 Next Time: The Horrors of the Grave. -- A Frightful Adventure.




                             CHAPTER CXCIX. [sic]

                               [Chapter 216]

THE HORRORS OF THE GRAVE. -- A FRIGHTFUL ADVENTURE.


     One would have thought that young Ringwood might with effect and with
discretion have disclosed his plan of watching in the old church to one of 
the
brothers of Clara, but he shrunk from doing that.

     In the first place he thought he should be put down as a visionary, and
as one who was disposed to insult the memory of Clara by imagining that the
story of the sexton could be true, and in the second place, if anything did
happen, he was afraid that the feelings of the brother might clash with his.

     "No," he said, "I will go alone-- I will not rest again until I have
thoroughly satsified myself that this tale is but a fabrication of the 
fancy.
Oh, Clara! can it be possible-- no, no.  The thought is by far too-- too
horrible."

     It may really be considered a fortunate thing that the communication of
the clergyman was made in the evvening, for had it been earlier in the day,
the hours of frightful anxiety which Ringwood would have endured until the
night came must have been most painful.

     As it was, however, the hours that would elapse ere he could venture to
go to the church on his strange and melancholy errand were not many, and 
they
passed the more quickly, that during some of them, he was making up his mind
as to what he should do.

     "Yes, Clara, my best beloved Clara," he said, "I will rescue your sweet
memory from this horrible doubt that is cast upon it, or I will join you in
the tomb.  Welcome, a thousand times welcome death, rather than that I 
should
live to think that you are-- God, no-- no!  I cannot pronounce the dreadful
word.  Oh, what evil times are these, and what a world of agony do I endure.
But courage, courage; let fancy sleep, I must not allow my imagination to
become sufficiently excited to play me any pranks to-night.  Be still my
heart, and let me go upon this expedition as a spectator merely.  Time 
enough
will it be to become an actor, when I know more, if indeed there be more to
know."

     The clergyman sent the key, according to his promise, by a confidential
servant, who had orders to ask for Mr. Ringwood and to give it into his own
hands, so that the young man was fully prepared to go, when the proper time
should arrive for him to start upon his expedition.

     He purposely kept very much out of the way of Sir George Crofton and 
his
two sons during the remainder of the evening, for such was the ingenuous
nature of young Ringwood, and so unused was he to place any curb upon his
speech, that he dreaded letting slip some information regarding his 
intention
to keep watch in the old church that night; in such a case it would have 
been
difficult to refuse company.

     Sir George took the advice of the clergyman and said nothing to any one
of the dreadful communication that had been made to him.  But he could not
conceal from the family and his servants, that some unusual grief was 
preying
upon him, beyond even the sadness that had remained after the death of his
daughter.  He retired to rest unusually early, that he might escape their
curious and inquiring glances.

     The clock struck eleven.

     "It is time," said Ringwood, as he sprung from his seat in his bed-
room.
"It is time.  For the love of thee, my Clara, I go to brave this adventure,
Mine are you in death as in life.  My heart is widowed, and can know no 
other
love."

     He armed himself with a pair of loaded pistols, for he made up his mind
that if any trickery was at the bottom of the proceeding, the authors of 
such
a jest should pay dearly for their temerity, and then cautiously descending
from his bed-room, he crossed the dining-room, and passing through a
conservatory, easily made his way out of the house, and into a flower-garden
that was beyond.

     He thought that if he went out of the grounds by the way of the 
porter's
lodge, it might excite some remark, his not returning again, so he went to a
part of the wall which he knew was low and rugged.

     "There," he said, "I can easily climb over, and by getting into the
meadows make my way into the road."

     This, to a young man, was not by any means a difficult matter, and he 
in
a few minutes more found himself quite free of the house and grounds, and
making his way very rapidly towards the church, the tower of which, he could
just see.

     The night was again a cloudy one; although nothing had as yet fallen, 
the
wind was uncertain, and no one could with any safety have ventured to 
predict
whether it would be fair, or rain.  Of the two, certainly, Ringwood would 
have
prefered [sic] moonlight, for he wished in the church to be able to see well
about him, without thinking of the necessity of a light.

     "No," he said, as he pursued his way, "I must have no light; that would
ruin all."

     By the time he reached the church, he had a better opinion of the
weather, and from a faint sort of halo that was in the sky, he was led to
believe that the moon's light would soon be visible, and enable him to see
everything that might take place.

     The key that the parson had given him opened the same little door by
which Will Stephens, the sexton, had entered, and there was no difficulty in
turning the lock, for it was frequently used.

     The young man paused for a moment, debating with himself, whether he
should fasten the door securely on the inner side, or leave it open, and at
last he thought, that considering all things, the latter was the best course
to pursue."

     "I do not wish," he said, "to stop any proceedings, so much as I wish 
to
see what they are.  There shall therefore be every facility for any one 
coming
into the church, who may chance to have an intention so to do."

     He still, it will be seen, clung a little to the hope that it was a
trick.

     When he pushed open the door that was covered with green baize, he 
found
that in consequence of the cloth curtain being entirely drawn aside from
before the south window, that there was not near the amount of darkness 
within
the building that he had anticipated finding there.

     When his eyes got a little accustomed to it, he could even see, dimly 
to
be sure, but still, sufficiently to distinguish the several shapes of the
well-known objects in the church.  The pulpit, the communion table, the 
little
rails before it, and some of the old monuments against the walls.

     The stone slab that covered the opening to the vault of the Crofton
family, had been before the commencement of the morning service properly
secured, so that that entrance could be walked over with perfect safety, and
Ringwood carefully ascertained that such was the fact.

     "Surely, surely," he said, "it is as Mr. Bevan says.  That man must 
have
come here half stupified by ale, and have gone to sleep,  The only thing 
that
gives the slightest semblance to such a tale, is the adventure of that most
mysterious man who was reclaimed from the sea."

     Yes, Ringwood was right.  That was the circumstance, full of dread and
awful mystery as it was, which sufficed to make anything else probable, and
possible.

     And what had become of him?  Since the time when he made his escape 
from
the Grange, nothing had been seen or heard of him unless that were he 
indeed,
who was in the church pointing to the moonlight when the terrified Will
Stephens was there.

     And yet Stephens, although he might be supposed to be in a position to
know him, did not recognise him, for we do not find in his account of the
affair that he made any mention of him, or insinuated any opinion even, that
the Mr. Smith of the bone-house, was the same person who had played so 
strange
a part in the church.

     The reader will have his own opinion.

     "Where shall I bestow myself," thought Ringwood, "I ought to be 
somewhere
from whence I can get a good view of the whole church."

     After some little consideration, and looking about him as well as the
semi-darkness would permit him, he thought that he could not by any
possibility do better than get into the pulpit.  From there he could readily
turn about in any direction from whence any noise might proceed, at the same
time, that it was something like a position which could not be very well
attacked except with fire arms, and if such weapons were used against him, 
he
should have the great advantage of seeing who was his assailant.

     Accordingly he ascended the pulpit stairs, and soon ensconced himself 
in
that elevated place.

     There was something very awful, and solemn, and yet beautiful about the
faint view he got of the old conventicle-looking church from its pulpit, and
irresistible had he chosen to resist it, there came to his lips a prayer to
Heaven for its aid, its protection, and its blessing upon his enterprise.

     How much calmer, and happier he felt after that.  How true it is, as
Prospero says, that prayer,
     ----"Pierces so that it assaults
     Mercy itself, and frees all faults."

     Who is there in the wide world who has not felt the benign influence of
an appeal to the great Creator of all things, under circumstances of
difficulty, and of distress.  Let us pity the heart, if there be such a one
in existence, that is callous to such a feeling.

     But there are none.  A reliance upon divine mercy is one of the
attributes of humanity, and may not be turned aside, by even all the
wickedness and the infidelity that may be arrrayed against it.

     "All is still," murmured Ringwood.  "The stillness of the very grave is
here, Oh, my Clara; methinks without a pang of mortal fear, I could converse
in such an hour as this, with thy pure and unsullied spirit!"

     In the enthusiasm of the moment, no doubt, Ringwood could have done so,
and it is a wonder that his most excited imagination did not conjure up some
apparent semblance of the being whom he loved so devotedly, and whose image 
he
so fondly cherished, even although she had gone from him.

     "Yes, my Clara," he cried, in tones of enthusiasm.  "Come to me, come 
to
me, and you will not find that in life or in death the heart that is all 
your
own, will shrink from you!"

     This species of mental exaltation was sure soon to pass away, and it 
did
so.  The sound of his own voice convinced him of the impropiety of such
speeches, when he came there as an observer.

     "Hush! hush!" he said.  "Be still, be still."

     It was evident to him that many clouds were careering over face of the
moon, for at times the church would get very dark indeed, and everything
assumed a pitchy blackness, and then again a soft kind of light would steal
in, and give the whole place a different aspect.

     This continued for a long time, as he thought, and more than once he
tried to ascertain the progress of the hours by looking at his watch, but 
the
dim light baffled him.

     "How long have I been here?" he asked himself; "I must not measure the
time by my feelings, else I should call it an age."

     At that moment the old church clock began to chime, and having 
proclaimed
the four quarters past eleven, it with its deep-toned solemn bell struck the
hour of twelve -- Ringwood carefully counted the strokes, so that, although 
it
was too dark to see his watch, he could not be deceived.

 Next Time: The Midnight Hour. -- The Stone Slab. -- The Vampire.




                              CHAPTER CC. [sic]

                               [Chapter 217]

THE MIDNIGHT HOUR. -- THE STONE SLAB. -- THE VAMPIRE.


     Yes, it was twelve o'clock, that mysterious hour at which it is 
believed
by many that
     "Graves give up their dead,
     And many a ghost in church-yard decay,
     Rise from their cold, cold bed
     To make night horrible with wild vagary."
Twelve, that hour when all that is human feels a sort of irksome dread, as 
if
the spirits of those who have gone from the great world were too near, 
loading
the still night air with the murky vapours of the grave.  A chilliness came
over Ringwood and he fancied a strange kind of light was in the church, 
making
objects more visible than in their dim and dusky outlines they had been
before.

     "Why do I tremble?" he said, "why do I tremble?  Clouds pass away from
before the moon, that is all.  Soon there may be a bright light here, and 
lo,
all is still; I hear nothing but my own breathing; I see nothing but what is
common and natural.  Thank heaven, all will pass away in quiet.  There will 
be
no horror to recount-- no terrifc sight to chill my blood.  Rest Clara, rest
in Heaven."

     Ten minutes passed away, and there was no alarm; how wonderfully 
relieved
was Ringwood.  Tears came to his eyes, but there were the natural tears of
regret, such as he had shed before for her who had gone from him to the 
tomb,
and left no trace behind, but in the hearts of those who loved her.

     "Yes," he said, mournfully "she has gone from me, but I love her still.
Still does the fond remebrance of all that she was to me, linger at my 
heart.
She is my own, my beautiful Clara, as she ever was, and as, while life
remains, to me she ever will be."

     At the moment that he uttered these words a slight noise met his ears.

     In an instant he sprung to his feet in the pulpit, and looked anxiously
around him[.]

     "What was that?" he said.  "What was that?"

     All was still again, and he was upon the point of convincing himself,
that the noise was either some accidental one, or the creation of his own
fancy, when it came again.

     He had no doubt this time.  It was a perceptible, scraping, strange 
sort
of sound, and he turned his whole attention to the direction from whence it
came.  With a cold creeping chill through his frame, he saw that that
direction was the one where was the family vault of the Croftons, the last
home of her whom he held still in remembrance, and whose memory was so dear 
to
him.

     He felt the perspiration standing upon his brow, and if the whole world
had been the recompense to him for moving away from where he was he could 
not
have done so.  All he could do was to gaze with bated breath, and distended
eyes upon the aisle of the church from whence the sound came.

     That something of a terrific nature was now about to exhibit itself, 
and
that the night would not go off without some terrible and significant
adventure to make it remembered he felt convinced.  All he dreaded was to
think for a moment what it might be.

     His thoughts ran on Clara, and he murmured forth in the most agonising
accents, --

     "Anything-- any sight but the sight of her.  Oh, no, no, no!"

     But it was not altogether the sight of her that he dreaded; oh no, it 
was
the fact that the sight of her on such an occasion would bring the horrible
conviction with it, that there was some truth in the dreadful apprehension
that he had of the new state of things that had ensued regarding the after
death condition of that fair girl.

     The noise increased each moment, and finally there was a sudden crash.

     "She comes! she comes!" gasped Ringwood.

     He grasped the front of the pulpit with a frantic violence, and then
slowly and solemnly there crossed his excited vision a figure all clothed in
white.  Yes, white flowing vestments, and he knew by their fashion that they
were not worn by the living, and that it was some inhabitant of the tomb 
that
he now looked upon.

     He did not see the face.  No, that for a time was hidden from him, but
his heart told him who it was.  Yes, it was his Clara.

     It was no dream.  It was no vision of a too excited fancy, for until
those palpable sounds, and that most fearfully palpable form crossed his
sight, he was rather inclined to go the other way, and to fancy what the
sexton had reported was nothing but a delusion of his overwrought brain.  
Oh,
that he could but for one brief moment have found himself deceived.

     "Speak!" he gasped; "speak! speak!"

     There was no reply.

     "I conjure you, I pray you though the sound of your voice should hurl 
me
to perdition-- I implore you, speak."

     All was silent, and the figure in white moved on slowly but surely
towards the door of the church, but ere it passed out, it turned for a 
moment,
as if for the very purpose of removing from the mind of Ringwood any 
lingering
doubt as to its identity.

     He then saw the face, oh, so well-known, but so pale.  It was Clara
Crofton!

     "'Tis she! 'tis she!" was all he could say.

     It seemed, too, as if some crevice in the clouds had opened at the
moment, in order that he should with an absolute certainty see the 
countenance
of that solemn figure, and then all was more than usually silent again.  The
door closed, and the figure was gone.

     He rose in the pulpit, and clasped his hands.  Irresolution seemed for 
a
few moments to sway him to and fro, and then he rushed down into the body of
the church.

     "I'll follow it," he cried, "though it lead me to perdition.  Yes, I'll
follow it."

     He made his way to the door, and even as he went he shouted, --

     "Clara! Clara! Clara!"

     He reached the threshold of the ancient church; he gazed around him
distractedly, for he thought that he had lost all sight of the figure.  No -
-
no, even in the darkness and against the night sky, he saw it once again in
its sad-looking death raiments.  He dashed forward.

     The moonbeams at this instant being freed from some dense clouds that 
had
interposed between them and this world, burst forth with resplendant beauty.

     There was not a tree, a shrub, nor a flower, but what was made distinct
and manifest, and with the church, such was the almost unprecedented lustre 
of
the beautiful planet, that even the inscriptions upon the old tablets and
tombs were distinctly visible.

     Such a reflulgence lasted not many minutes, but while it did, it was
most beautiful, and the gloom that followed it seemed doubly black.

     "Stay, stay," he shouted, "yet a moment, Clara; I swear that what you
are, that will I be.  Take me over to the tomb with you, say but that it is
your dwelling-place, and I will make it mine, and declare it a very palace 
of
the affections."

     The figure glided on.

     It was in vain that he tried to keep up with it.  It threaded the
churchyard among the ancient tombs, with a gliding speed that soon distanced
him, impeded, as he continually was, by some obstacle or another, owing to
looking at the apparition he followed, instead of the ground before him.

     Still, on he went, heedless whether he was conveyed, for he might be 
said
to be dragged onward, so much were all his faculties both of mind and body
intent upon following the apparition of his beloved.

     Once, and once only, the figure passed, and seemed to be aware that it
was followed for it flitted round an angle made by one of the walls of the
church, and disappeared from his eyes.

     In another moment he had turned the same point.

     "Clara, Clara!" he shouted.  "'Tis I-- you know my voice, Clara, 
Clara."

     She was not to be seen, and then the idea struck him that she must have
re-entered the church, and he too, turned, and crossed the threshold.  He
lingered there for a moment or two, and the whole building echoed to the 
name
of Clara, as with romantic eagerness, he called upon her by name to come 
forth
to him.

     Those echoes were the only reply.

     Maddened -- rendered desperate beyond all endurance, he went some
distance into the building in search of her, and again he called.

     It was in vain; she had eluded him, and with all the carefulness and 
all
the energy and courage he had brought to bear upon that night's proceedings,
he was foiled.  Could anything be more agonising than this to such a man as
Ringwood -- he who loved her so, that he had not shrunk from her, even in
death, although she had so shrunk from him.

     I will find her-- I will question her," he cried.  "She shall not 
escape
me; living or dead, she shall be mine.  I will wait for her, even in the
tomb."

     Before he carried out the intention of going actually into the vault to
await her return, he thought he would take one more glance at the churchyard
with the hope of seeing her there, as he could observe no indications of her
presence in the church.

     With this view he proceeded to the door, and emerged into the dim 
light.
He called upon her again by name, and he thought he heard some faint sound 
in
the church behind him.  To turn and make a rush into the building was the 
work
of a moment.

     He saw something -- it was black instead of white -- a tall figure -- 
it
advanced towards him, and with great force, before he was aware that an 
attack
was at all intended, it felled him to the ground.

     The blow was so sudden, so unexpected, and so severe, that it struck 
him
down in a moment before he could be aware of it.  To be sure, he had arms 
with
him, but the anxiety and agony of mind he endured that night, since seeing 
the
apparition come from the tomb had caused him to forget them.

 Next Time: The Young Girl in the Village, and the Awful Visit.




                              CHAPTER CCI. [sic]

                               [Chapter 218]

THE YOUNG GIRL IN THE VILLAGE, AND THE AWFUL VISIT.


     It is now necessary that we draw the reader's attention to a humbler
place of residence than the Grange, with its spacious chambers and lordly
halls.

     Situated not very far from the church, and almost close to the
churchyard, upon which its little garden abutted, was a cottage, the picture
of rural neatness and beauty.  In the winter it was beautiful and 
picturesque,
but in the summer time, when its porch was overrun with the woodbine and the
sweet clematis, it was one of the sweetest of abodes that content and
happiness could ever live in.

     This cottage was inhabited by an old woman and her only child, a young
girl of sixteen, beautiful as a rose, and as guileless as an angel.  They
contrived to live upon a small annuity that the mother had from a family in
whose service she spent the best years of her life, and who, with a 
generosity
that would be well to be abundantly and extensively imitated, would not see
their old dependant want.

     These two innocent and blameless persons had retired to rest at nine
o'clock, their usual hour, and had slept the calm sleep of contentment until
about half-past one, when the mother was awakened by a loud and piercing
shriek from her daughter's chamber.

     To spring from her humble couch was the work of a moment.

     "Anna, Anna! my child, Anna!" she shrieked.

     As she did so, she rushed across the small stair landing which 
separated
the two, and the only two upper rooms of the cottage, and was about to enter
her daughter's room, when the door of it was opened from within, and the old
dame's heart died within her, as she saw a figure upon the threshold, 
attired
in the vestments of the grave, and opposing her entrance.

     Was it a dream, or did she really see such a sight?

     Aghast and trembling the mother stood, unable for a moment or two to
speak, and as she fell fainting upon the landing, she thought that something
passed her, but she could not be quite sure, as it was at the instant her
faculties were flitting from her.

     How long she lay in that seeming death she knew not, and when she
recovered, it was some few minutes before recollection came back to her, and
she really remembered what had so completely overpowered her.

     But when her reason did resume its sway, and she recollected that it 
was
some danger to Anna, which had first alarmed her, she called her loudly by 
her
name.

     "Anna, Anna, speak to me."

     "Mother, mother," replied the young girl.  "Oh, come to me."

     These words suppplied strength to the old woman, and rising she made 
her
way immediately into the chamber of her daughter, whom she found in an agony
of fear; a light was procured, and then Anna flung herself upon her mother's
neck, and wept abundantly.

     "Oh, mother, tell me, convince me that it was only a dream."

     "What, my child? oh what?"

     The girl trembled so much that it was only by the utmost persuasion 
that
the following account was got from her, of the cause of her fright.

     She said that she had gone to sleep as usual within a very few minutes
after going to bed, that she enjoyed a calm, and uninterrupted slumber, the
duration of which she had no means whatever of guessing, but she was 
partially
awakened by a noise at the window of her room.

     She instantly rose and stood looking at the window, on which a sort of
shadow seemed to pass without, which alarmed her exceedingly.

     Still as it did not come gain, and as she certainly had not been fully
awake when she sprung from her bed, she had thought it quite possible that 
all
might be a dream, and had forborne from making any alarm upon the subject.

     After some hesitation she had persuaded herself to go to bed again, and
when there, although she sometimes started awake fancying she heard 
something,
she at length yielded to sleep, and again slept, soundly for a time, until a
new circumstance awakened her.

     She thought she felt something touching her about the neck, and after
opening her eyes, the moonlight, which at that moment happened to be very
bright, disclosed to her a white figure standing by the side of her bed, the
face of which figure was leaning over her, and within a very few inches of 
her
own.

     Terror at first deprived her of all power of speech or motion, but as 
the
figure did not move, she at length gave utterance to her fears in that 
shriek
which had come from her lips, and so much alarmed the mother.

     This was all the young girl could say, with the exception that the 
figure
when she shrieked appeared to glide away, but where to she had no means of
telling, for some clouds at that moment came again over the face of the 
moon.

     The mother was much affected and terrified, and at first she thought of
calling up her neighbours, but at length as the night was considerably
advanced, and the intruder gone, they agreed to let the matter rest till
morning, and the mother retired to her room again.

     How long it was before the shriek form her daughter's room came again 
she
did not know, but come again it did.

     Yes, again came the dreadful shriek.  It was -- it could be no delusion
now -- and the mother once more sprung from her couch to rush to the rescue 
of
her child.

     Confused and bewildered, she darted onward to the chamber, but the door
was fast, nor could all her exertions suffice to open it.

     "Anna, Anna!" she shouted, "speak to me.  One word only, my child, my
child."

     All was still.  The trembling mother placed her ear to the door, and 
she
heard a strange sucking sound, as if an animal was drinking with labour and
difficulty.  Her head seemed to be on fire, and her senses were upon the 
point
of leaving her, but she did manage to reach her own room.  She flew to the
little casement -- she dashed it open.

     "Help! help! help! -- for the love of God, help!"

     There was no reply.

     Again she raised her voice in shrieking wild accents.

     "Help! -- murder! -- help!"

     "What is it?" shouted a man's voice.  It was one who was going some
distance to take in his fishing nets.

     "Oh! thank God, some human being hears me.  Come in, come in."

     "How am I to get in?"

     "Stay a moment, and I will come down and open the cottage door for you.
For the love of mercy do not go away."

     Trembling and terrified to a dreadful excess, the old woman went down
stairs and let the man into the cottage, when they both proceeded up to the
chamber of the daughter.

     "What do you suppose is the matter?" asked the fisherman.

     "Oh! I know not-- I know not; but twice to-night-- twice has this
dreadful alarm happened.  Do not leave us-- oh, do not."

     "I don't want;' but I should hardly think thieves would find it worth
their while to come here at all for wht [sic] they would get.  You must have
been dreaming."

     "Oh, that I could think so!"

     Anna's chamber was reached; and there, to the horror of the mother, she
was found lying perfectly insensible on her bed, with a quantity of blood
smeared about her neck.

     "Why, it's a murder!" cried the fisherman; and firmly impressed with 
such
a belief, he ran out of the house to spread an alarm.

     The window of the chamber was wide open, and from that the mother now
cried aloud for help; so that between her and the fisherman, such a
disturbance was made all over the neighbourhood, that they were soon likely 
to
have more assistance than could be useful.

     The people living the nearest were soon roused, and they roused others,
while the distracted woman, who believed Anna was dead, called for justice 
and
for vengeance.

     The alarm spread from house to house -- from cottage to hall -- and, in
the course of half-an-hour, most of the inhabitants of the village had risen
to hear the old dame's account of the horrible proceeding that had taken 
place
that night in the cottage.

     Exaggeration was out of the question.  The fact itself was more than
sufficient to induce the greatest amount of horror in the minds of all who
heard it, and there was one, and only one, whose information enabled him to
give a name to the apparition that had assaulted Anna.  That one was the
schoolmaster of the place, and he, after hearing the story, said, --

     "If one could persuade oneself at all of the existence of such horrors,
one would suppose that a vampire had visited the cottage."

     This was a theme that was likely to be popular.  The schoolmaster
foolishly gave way to the vanity, and explained what a vampire was -- or was
supposed and said to be; and soon the whole place was in a state of the most
indescribable alarm upon the subject.

     As yet the horrible news had not reached the Grange, but it was 
destined
soon to do so; and better would it have been that any one had at once 
plunged
a dagger in the heart of poor Sir George Crofton than that there should be
thought to be such a horrible confirmation of his worst fears.

     To be sure, his daughter was not named, but he received the news with a
scream of anguish, and fell insensible into the arms of his son.

     All was confusion.  The servants ran hither and thither, not knowing 
what
to do, and it was not until Mr. Bevan arrived that something like order was
restored.  He as a privileged friend assumed for the nonce a kind of
dictatorship at the Grange, and gave orders, which were cheerfully and
promptly obeyed.  Then he desired a strictly private interview with Sir
George.

     It was, or course, granted to him; but the old baronet begged that
Charles and Edwin might now know all.  It was Emma alone from whom he wished
to keep the awful truth.

                               [Chapter 219]

THE AWFUL SUPPOSITION -- A RESOLUTION.


     It was with some reluctance that the clergyman spoke.

     "Sir," he said to the old baronet, "and you, my young gentleman, I am
afraid-- very much afraid, that I am doing anything but right in 
countenancing
a supposition so utterly at variance with all my own notions and feelings; 
but
my abhorrence of a secret impels me to speak.

     "Say on, sir-- say on," cried Sir George.  "Perhaps we are better
prepared to hear what you have to tell, than you imagine."

     After this Mr. Bevan had less reluctance to speak, he said, --

     "I was aware, although you all were not, that Mr. Ringwood intended to
keep watch last night in the church, in order to test the truth of what had
been told by Will Stephens, the sexton.  I did all I could to persuade him
from making the attempt, but when I found that nothing else would satisfy 
him,
I thought it prudent to give him the means of carrying out what had become
such a fixed intention with him, that to oppose it was to do far more 
mischief
than to grant it all the aid I had in my power to do."

     Sir George gave a nod of assent.

     "He went there," continued Mr. Bevan, "with a private key of my own, 
and
took his place in the church."

     "I wish, sir, you had been with him," said Edwin.

     "Yes," added Charles.  "If you, with your cool, calm, unbiassed 
judgment
had been there, we should have been much better able to come to a correct
conclusion about what occurred; for that something did occur, or was 
supposed
by Ringwood to do so, we can well guess."

     "I wish, indeed, I had been there," said Mr. Bevan, "but he begged so
earnestly to be allowed to go alone, that I had not the heart ot refuse 
him."

     "And what happened, sir?"

     "I will tell you.  I gave him a key which admitted him to the church, 
by
the small private entrance, at which I usually go in myself; in fact, it was
my own private key, for I at times visit the church, and wish to do so, when 
I
am not expected by those who have the ordinary charge of it."

     "We have heard as much."

     "No doubt.  Well, then, I say I gave him that key, but it was my 
sympathy
with his evident distress rather than my judgment which consented to do so,
and I had hardly done it, when I began to busy myself with conjectures, and
to deeply regret that I had yielded to him so easily.  'What if he, in his
excited and grief-stricken state of mind, should come to some serious
mischief?' I said to myself, 'should not I be very much to blame?  Would not
all prudent persons say that I did very wrong to send a man in such a
condition of mind into a church at midnight, alone?'"

     "Your motives and your known character, sir, would protect you," said
Charles.

     "I hope so," continued Mr. Bevan.  "I think it would from all other
charges, but imprudence; and if any great mischance had befallen Ringwood, I
should not so readily have forgiven myself, as others might have been 
induced
to forgive me."

     "I understand that feeling," said Sir George.

     "Well, then, with such sensations tugging at my heart, no wonder I 
could
not rest, and so at a little after twelve, I rose, and hastily dressing
myself, I left my house as noiselessly as possible, and made my way towards
the church.  The moon's light was at that time obscured, but every spot was 
so
familiar to me, that I was able to go with speed, and I soon reached the
venerable building.  I walked round it, until I came to the door, the key of
which I had given to Mr. Ringwood; it was open, but the moment I crossed the
threshold, I stumbled on his insensible form."

     "Go on! go on!  He had seen something terrible," gasped Sir George; "I 
am
nerved, I think, for the very worst; I pray you, sir, go on, and tell me 
all."

     "I will, Sir George, because I feel convinced it is my duty to conceal
nothing in this transaction, and because I think you had better more calmly
and dispassionately, and without exaggeration, hear from me all that is to 
be
told."

     "That is a good reason, sir," said Edwin.  "We should, of course, hear
all from other sources, and probably, with all the aids that a feeling for 
the
marvellous could append to it."

     "That is my impression.  When, then, I stumbled over a person lying 
just
within the little private door of the church, I had no immediate means of
knowing who it was; I tell you it was Ringwood, because I afterwards
discovered as much.  I had the means of getting a light; when I did so, I
found Ringwood lying in a swoon, while at the same time, I could not but
notice a large bruise upon his forehead.

     "Of course, my first duty was to look after him, instead of troubling
myself about his assailant, and having placed him in as convenient a posture
as I could, I hurried home again, and roused up my servants.  With their
assistance I got him to my house, and placed him in bed."

     "And did you search the church, sir?"

     "I did.  I went back and searched it thoroughly, but found nothing at 
all
suspicious.  Everything was in its right place, and I could not account for
the affair at all, because of the wound that Ringwood had.  I was most 
anxious
to hear from him that he had had a fall."

     "But-- but," said Sir George, falteringly, "he told a different story."

     "He did."

     "A story which you will not keep from us."

     "I do not feel myself justified, as I have said, in keeping it from 
you.
this is it."

     The clergyman then related to the family of the Croftons what is 
already
known to the reader concerning the adventures of Ringwood in the old church,
and which that morning, upon his recovery, Ringwood had told to him most
circumstantially.

     We need scarcely say that this recital was listened to with the most
agonized feelings.  Poor Sir George appeared to be most completely overcome
by it.  He trembled excessively, and could not command himself sufficiently 
to
speak.

     The two brothers looked at each other in dismay.

     "Now, I pray you all to consider this matter more calmly," said Mr.
Bevan, "than you seem inclined to do."

     "Calmly," gasped Sir George, "calmly."

     "Yes-- what evidence have we after all that the whole affair is 
anything
more than a dream of Mr. Ringwood's?"

     "Does he doubt it?"

     "No-- I am bound to tell you that he does not; but we may well do so 
for
all that.  He is the last person who is likely to give in to the opinion 
that
it is a mere vision, so strangely impressed as it is upon his imagination.
Recollect always that he went to the church prepared to see something."

     "Oh, if we could but think it unreal," said Sir George, glancing at his
sons, as if to gather their opinions of the matter from their countenances.

     "I will cling to such a thought," said Charles, "until I am convinced
otherwise through the medium of my own senses."

     "And I," said Edwin.

     "You are right," added Mr. Bevan, "I never in the whole course of my
experience heard of anything of which people should be so slow of believing
in, as this most uncomfortable affair.  You now know all, and it is for
yourselves, of course, to make whatever determination you think fit.  If I
might advise, it would be that you all take a short tour, perhaps on the
continent for a time."

     "Mr. Bevan," said Sir George, in a kindly tone, "I am greatly obliged 
to
you.  The suggestion I know springs from the very best and friendly motives;
but it carries with it a strong presumption that you really do think there 
is
something in all this affair which it would be as well to have settled in my
absence."

     The clergyman could not deny but that some such feeling was at the 
bottom
of his advice; but still he would not admit that he was at all convinced of
the reality of what was presumed to have happened, and a short pause in the
conversation ensued, after which Sir George spoke with a solemn air of
determination, saying to his sons, as well as to his friend and pastor, Mr.
Bevan,

     "When I tell you that I have made a determination from which nothing 
but
the hand of heaven visiting me with death shall move me, I hope no one here
will try to dissuade me from carrying it out."

     After such an exordium it was a difficult thing to say anything to him,
so he continued, --

     "My child was dear-- very dear to me in life, and I have no 
superstitious
fears concerning one who held such a place in my affections.  I am resolved
that to-night I will watch her poor remains, and at once convince myself of 
a
horror that may drive me mad or take a mountain of grief and apprehension 
off
my heart."

     "Father," cried Charles, "you will allow me to accompany you."

     "And me," added Edwin.

     "My sons, you are both deeply interested in this matter-- you would be
miserable while I was gone if you were not with me.  Moreover, I will not
trust my own imagination entirely-- we will all three go, and then we cannot
be deceived.  This is my most solemn resolution."

     "I have only one thing to say regarding it," said Mr. Bevan, "that is, 
to
prefer an earnest request that you will allow me to be one of the party-- 
you
shall sit in a pew of the church, that shall command a view of the whole
building."

     "Accompany us, Mr. Bevan, if you will," said Sir George, "but I sit in 
no
pew."

     "No pew?"

     "No.  But my child's coffin, in the vault where repose the remains of
more than one of my race who had been dear to me in life, will I take my
place."

     There was an earnest resolved solemnity about Sir George's manner, 
which
showed that he was not to be turned from his purpose, and Mr. Bevan
accordingly did not attempt to do so.  He had done what he scarcely 
expected,
that is, got a consent to accompany him to the night vigil, and at all 
events
let what would happen, he as a more disinterested party than the others, 
would
be able, probably to interfere and prevent any disastrous circumstances from
arising.

     "Say nothing of what has been determined on to any one," said Sir 
George,
"keep it a profound secret, sir, and this night will put an end to the agony
of doubt."

     "Depend upon me.  Will you come to my house at eleven o'clock, or shall 
I
come here?"

     "We will come to you; it is in the way."

     Thus then the affair was settled, so far satisfactorily, that there was
to be a watch actually now in the vault, so that there could be no delusion,
no trick prctised. [sic] -- What will be the result will be shown very
shortly; in the meantime we cannot but tremble at what that attached and
nearly heart-broken father may have still to go through.

     The excitement too in the village was immense; for the story of the
vampyre's attack upon the young girl was fresh in everybody's mouth, and it
lost nothing of its real horrors by the frequency with which it was 
repeated,
and the terror-stricken manner in which it was dilated upon.

 Next Time: The Grand Consultation at the Ale-house. -- The Awful 
Suggestion.



                              CHAPTER CCIII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 220]

THE GRAND CONSULTATION AT THE ALE-HOUSE. -- THE AWFUL SUGGESTION.


     Sir George Crofton and his family could form no idea, owing to not 
being
in a position to know, of the state of excitement produced in the village by
the mysterious and frightful attack which had been made upon the widow's
daughter.

     When people are very much absorbed with their own grief, they are apt 
to
set a lighter value upon those of others, and thus it was that the family of
the Croftons was so entirely taken up with what itself felt and had to do 
that
there was little room for sympathy with others.

     Mr. Bevan likewise, from his perculiar and respectable position, was 
not
likely to be made the depository of gossiping secrets; the inhabitants of 
that
little place were in the habit of approaching him with respect, so that,
although, as we are aware, he had heard from Will Stephens, the sexton, a 
full
and particular account of what had happened to him in the old church, and 
was
likewise cognizant of the story of the midnight attack upon the widow's
daughter, he was not fully aware of the startling effect which those
circumstances had had upon the small population of that fishing village.

     We are bound to believe that if he had had any idea of the real result 
of
those operations or of what was contemplated as their result -- he would 
have
done his best to adopt some course to prevent any disastrous collision.

     We, however, with all the data and materials of this most singular
narrative before us, are enabled to detail to the reader facts and 
occurrences
as they took place actually, without waiting the arrival of those periods at
which they reached the knowledge of those actors in the gloomy drama of real
life.

     Our readers, then, will please to know that the excitement among the
inhabitants of the place was of that violent and overbearing description, 
that
all the occupations of the villagers were abandoned, and a spirit of 
idleness,
sadly suggestive of mischief, began to be prevalent among them.

     This feeling was increased by frequent visits to the ale-house, the
liquor of which was well esteemed by Will Stephens, as may be readily
imagined; and towards evening the large old-fashioned parlour of that place 
of
entertainment became crowded with a motley assemblage, whose sole purpose in
meeting together was to drink strong ale, and discuss the irritating and
exciting subject of the appearance of the vampyre in the village.

     This discussion, from being at first a sober, serious, and alarmed one,
became noisy and violent; and at length a blacksmith, who was a great man in
the politics of the place, and who of all things in the world most admired 
to
hear his own voice, rose and addressed his compeers in something of a set
speech.

     "Listen to me," he said; "are we to have the blood sucked out of all 
our
bodies by a lot of vampyres?  Is our wives and daughters to be murdered in 
the
middle of the night?"

     "No, no, no," cried many voices; "certainly not."

     "Is we to be made into victims, or isn't we?  What's Sir George Crofton
and his family to us?  To be sure he's the landlord of some of us, and a 
very
good landlord he is, too, as long as we pay our rent."

     "Here, hear, hear."

     "But there's no saying how long he might be so, if we didn't."

     "Bravo, Dick!" cried the master of the place, handing the orator a pot;
"bravo, Dick! take a pull at that, old fellow."

     "Thank you, Muggins.  Now, what I proposes is--"

     "Stand on a chair, and let's all hear you."

     "Thank you," said the blacksmith; and getting upon a chair, he was 
about
to commence again, when some one advised him to get upon the table, but in 
an
effort to accomplish that feat, he unfortunately trod upon what was a mere
flap of the table, which had not sufficient power to support his weight, and
down he came amid an assemblage of pots, jugs, and glasses, which made a 
most
alarming crash.

     This roused the fury of the landlord, who had no idea of being made 
such
a sufferer in the transaction, and he accordingly began to declaim heavily 
at
his loss.

     A dispute arose as to how he was to be repaid, and it was finally 
settled
that a general subscription would be the best mode of reimbursing him.

     If anything was wanting to work up the feelings of the topers at the
public-house to the highest pitch of aggravation, it certainly was their
having to disburse for breakages a sum of money which, if liquified, would
have trickled most luxuriously down their throats.  They were consequently
ripe and ready for anything which promised vengeance upon anybody.

     The blacksmith was not discomfited by his fall.  When is a man who is
fond of hearing himself talk discomfited by anything? and he soon resumed 
his
oration in the following words: --

     "Is we to be put upon in this kind of way?  Why, we shan't be able to
sleep in our beds.  All I asks is, is we to put up with it?"

     "But what are we to do?" said one.

     "Ah! there's the question," said the blacksmith, "I don't know 
exactly."

     "Let's ask old Timothy Brown," said the butcher, "he's the oldest man
here."

     This was assented to; and accordingly the individual mentioned was
questioned as to his ideas of the way of avoiding the alarming catastrophe
which seemed to be impending over them.  He advised them to wait patiently
till the next night, and keep awake till the unwelcome nocturnal visitor 
made
its appearance, when whoever it might visit was boldly to assail it, without
any fear of the consequences to himself, till further assistance could be
procured.  After Timothy Brown had delivered himself of this piece of 
advice,
a dead silence ensued among the late boisterous company.  There were many
disentients, and a few who seemed in favour of a trial of the practicability
of the plan.  Both parties seemed to give some consideration to the
proposition, and they were by far too much engaged in thinking of the advice
which had been given them, to pay much attention to the quarter from whence 
it
had emanated; more particularly, too, as from his age and infirmities, he 
was
incapacitated from carrying it out or from giving any active assistance to
those who were disposed to do so.

     A great many efforts were made to get him to say more, particularly 
with
reference to the case under consideration, as being no common one, but the
octogenarian had made his effort, and he only replied to the remonstrances 
of
those who, alternately by coaxing and bullying, strove to get information 
from
him, by a vacant stare.

     "It's of no use," said the butcher, "you'll get nothing more now from 
old
Timothy; he's done up now, that's quite clear, and ten to one if the
excitement of to-night won't go a good way towards slaughtering him before 
his
time."

     "Well, it may be so," cried the blacksmith, "but still it's good 
advice,
and as I said before it comes to this-- is we to be afraid to lay down in 
our
beds at night, or isn't we?"

     Before any reply could be made to this interrogatory, the old clock 
that
was in the public-house parlour struck the hour of eleven, and another peal 
of
thunder seemed to be answering to the tinkling sounds.

     "It's a rough night," said one, "I thought there would be a storm 
before
morning by the look of the sun at setting-- it went down with a strange 
fiery
redness behind a bank of clouds. I move for going home."

     "Who talks of going home," cried the blacksmith, "when vampires are
abroad? hasn't old Timothy said, that a stormy night was the very one to
settle the thing in."

     "No," cried another, "he did not say night at all."

     "I don't care whether he said night or day; I've made up my mind to do
something; there's no doubt about it but that a vampyre is about the old
church.  Who'll come with me and ferret it out? it will be good service done
to everybody's fireside."

 Next Time: The Night Watch. -- The Vault.




                              CHAPTER CCIV. [sic]

                               [Chapter 221]

THE NIGHT WATCH. -- THE VAULT.


     It was each moment becoming a more difficult affair to carry on any
conversation in the public-house parlour, for not only did the thunder each
moment almost interrupt the speakers with its loud reverberations, but now 
and
then such a tremendous gust of wind would sweep round the house that it 
would
be quite impossible for any one to make himself heard amidst its loud 
howling
noise.

     These were circumstances however, which greatly aided no doubt, in the
getting up of a superstitious feeling in the minds of the people there
assembled, which made them ripe for any proposition, which perhaps in their
soberer moments they would have regarded with considerable dismay; hence 
when
the blacksmith rushed to the door, crying, --

     "Who will follow me to the old church and lay hold of the vampyre?" 
about
half-a-dozen of the boldest and most reckless, -- and be it told to their
honour (if there be any honour in such an enterprise, which after all, was a
grossly selfish one,) they were the worst characters in the village -- 
started
to their feet to accompany him thither.

     There are many persons who waver about an enterprise, who will join it
when it has a show of force, and thus was it with this affair.  The moment 
it
was found that the blacksmith's proposition had some half-dozen stout
adherents, he got as many more -- some of whom joined him from curiosity, 
and
some from dread of being thought to lack courage by their companions if they
held off.

     There was now a sufficiently large party to make a respectable
demonstration, and quite elated with his success, and caring little for the
land storm that was raging, the blacksmith, closely followed by the butcher,
who had no objection in life to the affair, especially as he was at variance
with the parson concerning the tithes of a little farm he kept, called out, 
--

     "To the church-- to the church!" and followed by the rabble, rushed
forward in the directon of the sacred edifice.

          *             *             *             *             *

     As the hour of eleven has struck, and as the reader is aware that at 
that
hour Sir George Crofton and his two sons, accompanied by Mr. Bevan, had 
agreed
to go to the church on their melancholy errand, we will leave the noisy
brawlers of the alehouse for the purpose of detailling the proceedings of
those whose fortunes we feel more closely interested in.

     The baronet was by no means wavering in his determination,
notwithstanding it had been made at a time of unusual excitement, when 
second
thoughts might have been allowed to step in, and suggest some other course 
of
proceeding.

     Now, Mr. Bevan was not without his own private hopes that such would be
the case; for what he dreaded above all other things was, the truth of the
affair, and that Sir George would have the horror of discovering that there
was much more in the popular superstition than, without ocular 
demonstration,
he would have been inclined to admit.

     Although a man of education and of refined abilities, the evidence that
had already showed itself to him of the existence at all events of some
supernatural being, with powers analogous to those of the fabled vampyre, 
was
such that he could not wholly deny, withough stultifying his intellect, that
there might be such things.

     It is a sad circumstance when the mind is, as it were, compelled to
receive undeniable evidence of a something which the judgment has the
strongest general reasons for disputing, and that was precisely the position
of Mr. Bevan, and a most unenviable one it was.

     That night's proceedings, however, in the vault, he felt must put an 
end
to all doubts and perplexity upon the subject, and so with a fervent hope
that, in some, at present inexplicable manner, the thing would be found to 
be
a delusion, he waited more anxiously the arrival of the Croftons at the
parsonage.

     At half past ten o'clock, instead of eleven, for as the evening 
advanced,
Sir George Crofton had shown such an amount of nervousness that his sons had
thought it would be better to bring him to the parsonage, they arrived, and
Mr. Bevan perceived at once what a remarkable effect grief and anxiety had
already had upon the features of the baronet.

     He was a different man to what, but a few days since, he had been, and
more than ever the kind clergyman felt inclined to doubt the expediency of 
his
being present on such an occasion, and yet how to prevent him if he were
really determined, was a matter of no small difficulty.

     "My dear friend," said Mr. Bevan, "will you pardon me if I make an 
effort
now to persuade you to abandon this enterprise?"

     "I can pardon the effort easily," said Sir George Crofton, "because I
know it is dictated by the best of motives, but I would fain be spared it, 
for
I am determined."

     "I will say no more, but only with deep sincerity hope that you may
return to your dwelling, each relieved from the load of anxiety that now
opresses you."

     "I hope to Heaven it may be so."

     "The night looks strange and still," said Charles, who wished to draw
his father's attention as much as possible from too close a contemplation of
the expedition on which they were bound.

     "It does," said Edwin; "I should not be surprised at a storm, for there
is every indication of some distubance of the elements.

     "Let it come," said Sir George, who fancied that in all those remarks 
he
detected nothing but a wish to withdraw him from his enterprise; "Let it 
come.
I have a duty to perform, and I will do it, though Heaven's thunders should
rock the very earth-- the forked lightning is not launched at the father who
goes to watch at the grave of his child."

     Charles and Edwin, upon finding that Sir George was in the mood to make 
a
misapplication of whatever was said to him, desisted from further remarks, 
but
left Mr. Bevan quietly to converse with him, in a calm and unirritating
manner.

     It was the object of the clergyman to put off as much time as possible
before proceeding to the church, so that the period to be spent in the 
family
vault of the Croftons should be lessened as much as possible, for he felt
assured that each minute there wasted would be one of great agony to the
bereaved father, who would feel himself once again in such close 
approximation
to that daughter on whom he had placed some of his dearest affections.

     Sir George, however, defeated this intention, by promply rising when 
his
watch told him that the hour of eleven had arrived, and it was in vain to
attempt to stultify him into a belief that he was wrong as regarded the 
time,
for the church was sufficiently near for them to hear the hour of eleven
pealed forth from its ancient steeple.

     "Come," said Sir George, "the hour has arrived.  I pray you do not 
delay.
I know you are all anxious and fearful concerning me, but I have a spirit of
resolution and firmness in this affair which shall yet stand me in good 
stead.
I shall not shrink, as you imagine I shall shrink.  Come, then, at once-- it
is suspense and delay which frets me, and not action."

     These words enforced a better spirit into both his sons and Mr. Bevan,
and in a few moments the party of four, surely sufficiently strong to 
overcome
any unexpected obstacles, or to defeat any trickery that might be attempted 
to
be passed off upon them, proceeded towards the church.

     It will be recollected that it was just a little after that time that 
the
storm commenced, and, in fact, the first clap of thunder, that seemed to 
shake
the heavens, took place just as they reached the old grave-yard adjoining to
the sacred building.

     "There!" exclaimed Charles, "I thought that it would come."

     "What matter?" said Sir George, "come on."

     "Humour him in everything," said Mr. Bevan, "It is madness now to
contradict him-- he will not recede under any circumstances."

     The natural senses of Sir George Crofton appeared to be preternaturally
acute, for he turned sharply, and said quickly, but not unkindly, --

     "No, he will not recede-- come on."

     After this, nothing was said until they reached the church door, and 
then
while Mr. Bevan was searching in his pockets for the little key which opened
the small private entrance, some vivid flashes of lightning lit up with
extraordinary brillancy the old gothic structure -- the neighouring tombs 
and
the melancholy yew trees that waved their branches in the night air.

     Perhaps the delay which ensued before Mr. Bevan cold find the key,
likewise arose from the wish to keep Sir George as short a time as possible
within the vault, but he at length produced it, for any further delay could
only be accounted for by saying that he had it not.

     The small arched doorway was speedily cleared, and as another peal of
thunder broke over head in awful grandeur of sound, they entered the church.

     Mr. Bevan took the precaution this time to close the door, so that 
there
could be no interruption from without.

     "Now, Sir George," he said, "remember your promise.  You are to come 
away
freely at the first dawn of day, and if nothing by then has occurred to
strengthen the frightful supposition which, I suppose I may say, we have all
indulged in, I do hope that for ever this subject will be erased from your
recollection."

     "Be it so," said Sir George; "be it so."

     Mr. Bevan then busied himself in lighting a lantern, and from beneath 
one
of the pews, where they were hidden, he procured a couple of crowbars, with
which to raise the stone that covered the entrance to the vault.

     These preparations took up some little time, so that the old clock had
chimed the quarter past eleven, and must have been rapidly getting on to the
half-hour, before they stood in the aisle close to the vault.

     "This marble slab," said Sir George, as he cast his eyes upon it, 
"always
hitherto has been cemented in its place.  Why is it not so now?"

     "Is it not?" said Mr. Bevan.

     "No-- lend me the light."

     Mr. Bevan was averse to lending him the light, but he could not very 
well
refuse it; and when Sir George Crofton had looked more minutely at the 
marble
slab, he saw that it had been cemented, but that the cement was torn and
broken away, as if some violence had been used for the purpose of opening 
the
vault; but whether that violence came from within or without was a matter of
conjecture.

THE MADMAN. -- THE VAMPYRE.


     "What does this mean?" cried Sir George Crofton, excitedly.

     "Hush!" said Mr. Bevan, "I pray you be calm, sir.  If you are to make 
any
discovery that will give you peace of mind, rest assured it will not be made
by violence."

     "You do not answer my question."

     "I cannot answer it."  Remember that I know no more than you do, and
that, like yourselves, I am an adventurer here in search of the truth."

     Sir George said no more upon that head, but with clasped hands and
downcast eyes he stood in silence, while his two sons, armed with the 
crowbars
that Mr. Bevan had provided for the occasion, proceeded to lift up the 
marble
slab that covered the vault where lay their sister's remains.

     The work was not one of great difficulty, for the slab was not very
large, and as it was not cemented down, it yield at once to the powerful
leverage that was brought to play against it, and in a few minutes it was
placed aside, and the yawning abyss appeared before them.

     "Oh! sir," said Mr. Bevan, "even now at this late hour, and when the
proceedings have commenced, I pray you to pause."

     "Pause!" cried Sir George, passionately, "pause for what?"

     "Disturb not the dead, and let them rest in peace.  Absolve your mind
from the dangerous and perhaps fatal fancies that possess it, and let us say 
a
prayer, and close again this entrance to the tomb."

     The sons hesitated, and they probably would have taken the clergyman's
advice, but Sir George was firm.

     "No, sir," he said, "already have I suffered much in coming thus far; I
will not retreat until I have effected all my purpose.  I swear it, by 
Heaven,
whose temple we now are in.  You would not, Mr. Bevan, have me break such an
oath."

     "I would not; but I regret you made it.  Since, however, it must be so,
and this rash adventure is determined upon, follow me; I will lead you the 
way
into these calm regions, where you can sleep, I trust, in peace."

     Sir George Crofton made a step forward, as if he would have arrested 
Mr.
Bevan's progress and lead the way himself, but already the clergyman had
descended several steps, so he had nothing to do but to follow him.

     This they all did, Sir George going immediately after him, and his two
sons, with pale anxious-looking faces, as if they had a suspicion that the
adventure would end in something terrific, came la[st and they] glanced 
nervously and suspiciously about them; but they said not a word, nor if they
had spoken, it would have been to express great apprehension, and that was
what they were ashamed to do.

     Mr. Bevan carried the light, and when he felt that he was at the bottom
of the stone steps, by finding that he was treading upon the sawdust that 
was
strewn on the floor of the vault, he turned and held the lamp up at arm's
length, so that his companions might see their way down the steps.

     In another minute they all stood on the floor of the vault.

     The light burnt with rather a faint and sickly glare, for so rapidly 
were
noxious gases evolved in that receptacle for the dead, that notwithstanding 
it
had been so frequently opened as it had been lately, they had again
accumulated.

     In a few moments, however, this was partially remedied by the air from
the church above, and the light burnt more brilliantly -- indeed, quite
sufficiently so to enable them to look around them in the vault.

     Sir George Crofton's feelings at that moment must have been of the most
painful and harrowing description.  He had lived long enough to be a witness
of the death and the obsequies of many members of his family whom he had 
loved
fondly, and there he stood in that chamber of death, surrounded by all the
remains of those beings, the memory of whose appearance and voices came now
freshly upon his mind.

     Mr. Bevan could well guess the nature of the sad thoughts that 
transpired
in the breast of the baronet, and the sons having by accident cast their 
eyes
upon the coffin that contained the remians of their mother, regarded it in
silence, while memory was busy, too, within them in conjuring up her image.

     "And it has come to this," said Sir George, solemnly.

     "We must all come to this," interposed Mr. Bevan; "this is indeed a 
place
for solemn and holy thoughts-- for self-examination, for self-condemnation."

     "But there is peace here."

     "There is-- the peace that shall be eternal."

     "Hark! hark!" said Charles; "what is that?"

     "The wind," said Mr. Bevan; "nothing but the wind howling round and
through the old belfry-- you will remember that it is a boisterous night."

     "Turn, turn, father."

     Sir George turned and looked at Charles, who pointed in silence to the
coffin which contained the corpse of his mother.  The light gleamed upon the
plate on which was engraved her name.  Sir George's features moved 
convulsively
as he read it, and he turned aside to hide a sudden gush of emotion that 
came
over him.

     After a few minutes, he touched Mr. Bevan on the arm, and said in a
whisper, -- 

     "Where did they place my child?"

     The clegyman pointed to the narrow shelf on which was the coffin of 
Clara
Crofton, and then Sir George, making a great effort to overcome his 
feelings,
said, --

     "Mr. Bevan, our worthy minister and friend, and you, likewise, my boys,
hear me.  You can guess to some extent, but not wholly-- that can only be
known by God-- the agony that a sight of the poor remains of her who has 
gone
from me in all the pride of her youth and beauty, must be to me; yet now 
that
I am here I consider it to be my duty to look once again upon the face of my
child-- my-- my lost Clara."

     "Oh! father, father," said Edwin, "forego this purpose."

     "You will spare us this," cried Charles.

     "Repent you, sir," said Mr. Bevan, "of the wish.  Let her rest in 
peace.
The dead are sanctified."

     "The dead are sanctified, -- but I am her father."

     "Nay, Sir George, let me implore you."

     "Implore me to what, sir?  Not to look upon the face of my own child?
Peace-- peace.  It is no profanation for one who loved her as I loved her to
look upon her once again.  Urge me no more."

     "This is in vain," said Charles.

     "You are right-- it is in vain."

     A shriek burst from the lips of Edwin at this moment, and flinging his
arms around his father, he held him back.  Mr. Bevan, too, gave a cry of
terror, and Charles stood with his hands clasped, as if turned to stone.

     Their eyes were all bent upon Clara's coffin.

     The lid moved, and a strange sound was heard from within that 
receptacle
for the dead -- the clock of the old church struck twelve -- the coffin lid
moved again, and then sliding on one side, it eventually fell upon the floor
of the vault.

     The four spectators of this scene were struck speechless for the time
with terror.  Then they stood gazing at the coffin as if they were so many
statues.

     And now the light which Mr. Bevan still for a miracle held in his
trembling grasp, shone on a mass of white clothing within the coffin, and in
another moment that white clothing was observed to be in motion.  Slowly the
dead form that was there rose up, and they all saw the pale and ghastly 
face.
A streak of blood was issuing from the mouth, and the eyes were open.

     Sir George Crofton lifted up both his hands, and struk [sic] his head,
and then he burst into a wild frightful laugh.  It was the laugh of 
insanity.

     Mr. Bevan dropped the light, and all was darkness.

     "Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!" laughed Sir George Crofton.  "Ha, ha, ha, ha, 
ha!"
and the horrible laugh was taken up by many an echo in the old church, and
responded to with strange and most unearthly reverberations.  "Ha, ha, ha,
ha!"  Oh what a dreadful sound that was coming at such a time from the lips 
of
the father.

     "Fly Edwin-- oh, fly," cried Charles.

     Edwin screamed twice, for he was full of horror, and then he fell on 
the
floor of the vault in a state of insensibility.

     Charles had just sense left him to spring towards the steps, and make a
frantic effort to reach the church; in his hurry he fell twice, but each 
time
rising again with a shout of despair, he resumed his efforts, and all the
while the horrible laugh of his maniac father sounded in his ears, a sound
which he felt that he should never forget.

     By a great effort he did reach the aisle of the church, and when there,
he called aloud.

     "Mr. Bevan, Mr. Bevan, help-- oh help!  For the love of God speak.  
Help,
help, Mr. Bevan, where are you, speak, I implore you?  Am I too going mad?  
Oh
yes, I shall-- I must.  What mortal intellect can stand such a scene as 
this.
Help, help-- oh, help!"

     The church was suddenly lit up by a flash of light, and turning in the
direction from whence it proceeded, Charles saw Mr. Bevan approaching with a
light, which he had procured from the chancel, and it would appear that
immediately upon dropping in his horror the light in the vault, he had ran 
up
the stairs with the intent of getting another.

     "Who calls me?  Who calls me?" he cried.

     ""I-- I," said Charles.  "Oh God, what a dreadful night is this."

     The clergyman was trembling violently, and was very pale, but he made 
his
way up to Charles, from whose brow the perspiration was falling in heavy
drops, and then again they heard the mad Sir George laughing in the vault.

     "Ha, ha, ha! ha, ha, ha! ha, ha, ha!"

     "Oh God, is not that horrible?" said Charles.

     "Most horrible," responded Mr. Bevan.

     Bang -- bang -- bang! at this moment came a violent knocking at the
church door, and then several voices were heard without shouting.

     "The vampyre-- the vampyre-- the vampyre."

     "What is that?  What is that?" said Charles.

     "Nay, I know not," replied Mr. Bevan, "I am nearly distracted already.
Where is your brother?  Did he not escape from the vault?  Where is he?  Oh,
that horrible laugh.  Good God! that knocking too at the church door.  What
can be the meaning of it?  Heaven in its mercy guide us now what to do."

     The reader will understand the meaning of the knocking, although those
bewildered persons who heard it in the church did not.  The fact is, that 
the
party from the alehouse headed by the valiant blacksmith, and heated by 
their
too liberal potations had just arrived at the church, and were clamouring 
for
admission.

     They had seen through one of the old pointed windows, the reflection of
the light which Mr. Bevan carried, and that it was that convinced them some
one was there who might if he would pay attention to the uproarous summons.

     The knocking lasted with terrible effect, for the old door of the 
sacred
edifice shook again, it seemed as if certainly it could not resist the 
making
of such an attack.

     Mr. Bevan was confounded.  A horrible suspicion came across him, of 
what
was meant by those violent demands for admission, and he shook with brutal
trepidation as he conjectured what might be the effect of the proceedings of 
a
lawless mob.

     "Now Heaven help us," he said, "for we shall soon I fear be powerless."

     "Good God! what mean you?" said Charles.

     "I scarcely know how to explain to you all my fears.  The are too
dreadful to think of, but while that knocking continues, what can I think?"

     "I understand"! they call for my sister."

     "Oh call her not now by that name.  Remember, and remember with a 
shudder
what she now is."

 Next Time: The Hunt of the Vampyre.




                             CHAPTER CCVII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 223]

THE HUNT OF THE VAMPYRE.


     All these occurrences which have taken a considerable time in telling,
occurred as simultaneously, that although it would appear Mr. Bevan and
Charles Crofton, rather neglected Sir George and Edwin who were still in the
vault, they had really not had time to think of them, to say nothing of 
making
any effort to extricate them from the frightful situation in which they were
placed.

     Probably, after procuring a light, Mr. Bevan would have rushed to their
rescue had not that incessant knocking at the church door suggested a new 
and
more horrible danger, still, from the evil passions of an infuriated
multitude.

     "Oh, Mr. Charles," he said, "if we could but get your father away from
the church, there is no knowing what an amount of misery he might be 
spared."

     "Misery, sir; surely there is no more misery in store for us-- have we
not suffered enough-- more than enough.  Oh, Mr. Bevan we have fallen upon
evil times, and I dread to think what will yet be the end of those most
frightful transactions."

     The knocking at the church door continued violently, and Charles
indicated a wish to proceed there to ascertain what it was, but Mr. Bevan
stopped him, saying, --

     "No, Charles-- no-- let them be, I hardly think they will venture to
break into the sacred edifice, but whether they do or not, remember that 
your
duty and mine, yours being the duty of a son, and mine that of a friend,
should take us now to your father's vault.

     "That is true, sir," said Charles, "lead on I will follow you."

     Mr. Bevan, who had all the intellectual courage of a man of education,
and of regular habits, led the way again to the vault, with the light in his
hand.  It was a great relief that the insane and horrible laugh of Sir 
George
Crofton had ceased, the best friend of any man could almost have wished him
dead, ere their ears had drunk in such horrible sounds.

     The shouts and cries from without now became incessant, and it seemed 
as
if some weapon had been procured, wherewith to hammer violently upon the
church door, for the strokes were regular and incessant, and it was evident
that if they continued long that frail defence against the incursions of the
rabble rout without must soon give way.

     The only effect, however, which these sounds had upon Mr. Bevan was to
make him hasten his progress towards the vault, for anything in the shape of 
a
collision between those who wanted to take the church by storm, and Sir 
George
Crofton, was indeed most highly to be deprecated.

     The steps were not many in number, and once again the clergyman and
Charles Crofton stood upon the sawdust that covered the flooring of the 
vault.

     At first, in consequence of the flaring of the light, the state of
affairs in that dismal region could not be ascertained; but as soon as they
could get a view, they found Sir George lying apparently in a state of
insensibility across the coffin of his daughter Clara, while Edwin was in a
swoon close to his feet.

     "Sir George, Sir George," cried Mr. Bevan, "arouse yourself; it is
necessary that you leave this place at once."

     The baronet got up and glanced at the intruders.  Charles uttered a 
deep
groan, for the most superficial observation of his father's face was
sufficient to convince him that reason had fled, and that wildness had set 
up
his wild dominion in his brain.

     "Father-- father," he cried, "speak to me, and dissipate a frightful
thought."

     "What would you have of me," said Sir George; "I am a vampyre, and this
is my tomb-- you should see me in the rays of the cold moon gliding 'twixt
earth and heaven, and panting for a victim.  I am a vampyre."

     At this moment Edwin seemed to be partially recovering, for his eyes
opened as he lay upon the floor, and he looked around him with a bewildered
gaze, which soon settled into one of more intelligence as memory resumed her
sway, and he recollected the various circumstances that had brought him into
his present position.

     "Rouse yourself, Edwin, rouse yourself," cried Mr. Bevan, "you must aid
us to remove your father."

     "Do you talk of me?" said Sir George, "know you not that I am one of
those supernatural existences known as the death and despair-dealing
vampyres-- it's time I took my nightly prowl to look for victims.  I must 
have
blood-- I must have blood."

     "Gracious Heaven! he raves," said Charles.

     "Heed him not," said Mr. Bevan-- "heed him not, and touch him not, so
that he leave the place-- when we have him once clear of the church we can
procure assistance, and take him to his own home.

     "Edwin," whispered Charles, "what of our sister."

     Edwin shook his head and shuddered.  "I know nothing but that I saw 
her--
oh, horrible sight, rising from her coffin, and then in a convulsion of 
terror
my senses fled-- a frightful ringing laugh came on my ears, and from that 
time
till now, be the period long or short, I have been blessed by a death-like
trance."

     "Blessed indeed," said Mr. Bevan; "tarry one moment."

     Sir George Crofton was ascending the steps of the vault, but his two 
sons
paused for an instant at the request of Mr. Bevan, and then the latter
approaching Clara's coffin slightly removed the lid, and was gratified as 
far
as any feeling could be considered gratification under such circumstances, 
to
find that the corpse occupied an ordinary position in its narrow resting
place.

     "All's right," he said, "let us persuade ourselves that this too has 
been
but a dream, that we have been deceived, and that imagination has played us
tricks it is accustomed to play to those who give it the rein at such hours 
as
these-- let us think and believe anything rather than that what we have seen
to-night is real."

     As he spoke these words, he ascended hastily the stps in pursuit of Sir
George, who, by this time had alone reached the [???]

     The heavy strokes against the door of the church had ceased, but an odd
sort of scraping, rattling sound at the lock convinced the clergyman that a
workman of more skill than he who had weilded [sic] the hammer, was now at
work, endeavouring to force an entrance.

     "Oh, if we could but get out," he said, "by the small private entrance,
all might be well; Charles, urge your father, I pray you."

     Charles did so to the best of his ability, but the blacksmith who had
originally incited the crowd to attack the church, in order to get 
possession
of the body of the vampyre, had sent to his workshop for the tools of his
craft, and soon quietly accomplished by skill what brute force would have 
been
a long time about, namely, the opening of the church-door.

     It was flung wide open, before Sir George Croton and his sons could 
reach
the small private entrance, of which Mr. Bevan had the key.

     The sight of the multitude of persons, for they looked such crowds in 
the
church porch, materially increased the incipient sadness of the bereaved
father.

 Next Time: The Fate of Sir George. -- The Cross Road.




                             CHAPTER CCVII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 224]

THE FATE OF SIR GEORGE. -- THE CROSS ROAD.


     Sir George, when he saw the crowd of persons, seemed to have some
undefined idea that they were enemies, but this would not have been 
productive
of any serious consequences, if it had not most unfortunately happened that 
a
most formidable weapon was within his grasp.

     That weapon consisted of one of the long iron crowbars which had been
successfully used by his own sons in order to force a passage to the family
vault, where such horrors had been witnessed.

     Suddenly, then, seizing this weapon, which, in the hands of a ferocious
man was a most awful one, he swung it once round his head, and then rushed
upon those he considered his foes.

     He dealt but three blows, and at each of those one of the assailants 
fell
lifeless in the church porch.

     To resist, or, to attempt to contend with a man so armed, and 
apparently
possessed of such preternatural strength, was what some of the party wished,
and accordingly a free passage was left for him, and he rushed out of the
church into the night air shouting for vengeance, and still at interval,
accusing himself of being a vampyre, as most dangerous theme to touch upon,
considering the then state of feeling in that little district.

     Anxiety for the safety of Sir George induced his sons and Mr. Bevan to
rush after him, regardless of all other consequences, so that the church, 
the
vaults, and everything they contained, were left to the mercy of a mob
infuriated by superstition, rendered still more desperate by the loss of 
three
of their number in so sudden and exampled a manner.

     They opposed no obstacle to the leaving of those persons, who thus for
dearer considerations abandoned the old church, but they rushed with wild
shouts and gesticulations into the building.

     "The vampyre, the vampyre," cried the blacksmith, "death to the 
vampyre--
death and destruction to the vampyre."

     "Hurrah!" cried another, "to the vaults this way to Sir George 
Crofton's
vault."

     There seemed to be little doubt now, but that this disorderly rabble
would execute summary vengeance upon the supposed nocturnal disturber of the
peace of the district.

     Ever and anon, too, as these shouts of discord, and of threatening
vengeance, rose upon the night air, there would come the distant muttering 
of
thunder, for the storm had not yet ceased, although its worst fury had
certainly passed away.

     Dark and heavy clouds were sweeping up from the horizon, and it seemed 
to
be tolerably evident that some heavy deluge of rain would eventually settle
the fury of the elements, and reconcile the discord of wind and electricity.

     Several of the rioters were provided with links and matches, so that in 
a
few moments the whole interior of the church was brilliantly illuminated,
while at the same time it presented a grotesque appearance, in consequence 
of
the unsteady and wavering flame from the links, throw myriads of dancing
shadows upon the walls.

     There would have been no difficulty under any ordinary circumstances in
finding the entrance to the vault, where the dead of the Crofton family 
should
have lain in peace, but now since the large flagstone that covered the
entrance to that receptacle of the grave was removed, it met their 
observation
at once.

     It was strange now to perceive how, for a moment, superstition having
led them on so far, the same feeling should induce them to pause, ere they
ventured to make their way down these gloomy steps.

     It was a critical moment, and probably if any one or two had taken a
sudden panic, the whole party might have left the church with precipitation,
having done a considerable amount of mischief, and yet as it is so ususal 
with
rioters, having left their principal object unaccomplished.

     The blacksmith put an end to this state of indecision, for, seizing a
link from the man who was nearest to him, he darted down the steps, 
exclaiming
as he did so, --

     "Whoever's afraid, need not follow me."

     This was a taunt they were not exactly prepared to submit to, and the
consequence was, that in a very few moments the ancient and time honoured
vault of the Crofton's was more full of the living than of the dead.

     The blacksmith laid his hand upon Clara's coffin.

     "Here it is," he said, "I know the very pattern of the cloth, and the
fashion of the nails, I saw it at Grigson's the undertaker's before it was
taken to the Grange."

     "Is she there-- is she there," cried half a dozen voices at once.

     Even the blacksmith hesitated a moment ere he removed the lid from the
receptacle of death, but when he did so, and his eyes fell upon the face of
the presumed vampyre, he seemed rejoiced to find in the appearances then
exhibited some sort of justification for the act of violence of which 
already
he had been the instigator.

     "Here you are," he said, "look at the bloom upon her lips, why her 
cheeks
are fresher and rosier than ever they were while she was alive, a vampyre my
mates, this is a vampyre, or may I never break bread again; and now what's 
to
be done.["]

     "Burn her, burn her," cried several.

     "Well," said the blacksmith, "mind its as you like.  I've brought you
here, and shown you what it is, and now you can do what you like, and of
course I'll lend you a hand to do it."

     Any one who had been very speculative in this affair, might have 
detected
in these last words of the blacksmith, something like an inclination to 
creep
out of the future consequences of what might next be done, while at the same
time shame deterred him from exactly leaving his companions in the lurch.

     After some suggestions then, and some argumentation as to the 
probability
or possibility of interruption-- the coffin itself, was with its sad and
wretched occupant, lifted from the niche where it should have remained until
that awful day when the dead shall rise for judgement, and carried up the
steps into the graveyard, but scarcely had they done so, when the surcharged
clouds burst over their heads, and the rain came down in perfect torrents.

     The deluge was of so frightful, and continuous a character, that they
shrank back again beneath the shelter of the church porch, and there waited
until its first fury had passed away.

     Such an even down storm seldom lasts long in our climate, and the
consequence was that in about ten minutes the shower had so far subsided 
that
although a continuous rain was falling it bore but a very distant comparison
to what had taken place.

     "How are we to burn the body on such a night as this?"

     "Aye, how indeed," said another; "you could not so much as kindle a 
fire,
and if you did, it would not live many minutes."

     "I'll tell you what to do at once," said one who had as yet borne but a
quiet part in the proceedings; I'll tell you what to do at once, for I saw 
it
done myself; a vampyre is quite as secure buried in a cross-road with a 
stake
through its body, as if you burned it in all the fires in the world; come 
on,
the rain won't hinder you doing that."

     This was a suggestion highly approved of, and the more so as there was 
a
cross road close at hand, so that the deed would be done quick, and the
parties dispersed to their respective homes, for already the exertion they 
had
taken, and the rain that had fallen, had had a great effect in sobering 
them.

     And even now the perilous and disgusting operation of destroying the
body, by fire or any other way, might have been abandoned, had any one of 
the
party suggested such a course-- but the dread of a future imputation of
cowardice kept all silent.

     Once more the coffin was raised by four of the throng, and carried
through the church-yard, which was now running in many little rivulets, in
consequence of the rain.  The cross-road was not above a quarter of a mile
from the spot, and while those who were disengaged from carrying the body,
were hurrying away to get spades and mattocks, the others walked through the
rain, and finally paused at the place they though suitable for that ancient
superstitious rite, which it was thought would make the vampyre rest in 
peace.

     It is hard to suppose that Sir George Crofton, his sons, and Mr. Bevan
were all deceived concerning these symptoms of vitality which they had
observed in the corpse of Clara; but certainly now, there was no appearance 
of
anything of the kind, and the only suspicious circumstances appeared to be 
the
blood upon the lips, and the very fresh-like appearance of the face.

     If it were really a fact that the attack of Varney the Vampyre upon 
this
fair young girl had converted her into one of those frightful existences, 
and
that she had been about to leave her tomb for the purpose of seeking a 
repast
of blood, it would appear that the intention had been checked and frustrated
by the presence of Sir George and his party in the vault.

     At last a dozen men now arrived well armed with spades and picks, and
they commenced the work of digging a deep, rather than a capacious grave, in
silence.

     A gloomly and apprehensive spirit seemed to come over the whole
assemblage, and the probability is that this was chiefly owing to the fact
that they now encountered no opposition, and that they were permitted
unimpeded to accomplish a purpose which had never yet been attempted within
the memory of any of the inhabitants of the place.

     The grave was dug, and about two feet depth of soil was thrown in a 
huge
mound upon the surface; the coffin was lowered, and there lay the corpse
within that receptacle of poor humanity, unimprisoned by any lid for that 
had
been left in the vault, and awaiting the doom which they had decreed upon 
it,
but which they now with a shuddering horror shrunk from performing.

     A hedge-stake with a sharp point had been procured, and those who held 
it
looked around them with terrified countenances, while the few links that had
not been extinguished by the rain, shed a strange and lurid glare upon all
objects.

     "It must be done," said the blacksmith, "don't let it be said that we 
got
thus far and then were afraid."

     "Do it then yourself," said the man that held the stake, "I dare not."

     "Aye, do," cried several voices; "you brought us here, why don't you do
it-- are you afraid after all your boasting."

     "Afraid-- afraid of the dead; I'm not afraid of any of you that are
alive, and it's not likely I'm ging to be afraid of a dead body; you're a
pretty set of cowards.  I've no animosity agaist the girl, but I want that 
we
shall all sleep in peace, and that our wives and children should not be
disturbed nocturnally in their blessed repose.  I'll do it if none of you'll
do it, and then you may thank me afterwards for the act, although I suppose 
if
I get into trouble I shall have you all turn tail upon me."

     "No, we won't-- no, we won't."

     "Well, well, here goes, whether you do or not.  I-- I'll do it 
directly."

     "He shrinks," cried one.

     "No," said another; "he'll do it-- now for it, stand aside."

     "Stand aside yourself-- do you want to fall into the grave."

     The blacksmith shuddered as he held the stake in an attitude to pierce
the body, and even up to that moment it seemed to be a doubtful case, 
whether
he would be able to accomplish his purpose or not; at length, when they all
thought he was upon the point of abandoning his design, and casting the 
stake
away, he thrust it with tremendous force through the body and the back of 
the
coffin.

     The eyes of the corpse opened wide -- the hands were clenched, and a
shrill, piercing shriek came from the lips -- a shriek that was answered by 
as
many as there were persons present, and then with pallid fear upon their
countenances they rushed headlong from the spot.

 Next Time: The Solitary Man. -- Varney's Despair.





                             CHAPTER CCVIII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 225]

THE SOLITARY MAN. -- VARNEY'S DESPAIR.


     There lay the dead, alone, in that awful grave, dabbled in blood, and 
the
victim of the horrible experiment that had been instituted to lay a vampire.
The rain still fell heavily.

     On, surely, pitying Heaven sent those drops to wash out the remembrance
of such a deed.  The grave slowly began to be a pool of water; it rose up 
the
sides of the coffin, and in a few minutes, more nothing of the ghastly and 
the
terrible contents of that grave could have been seen.

     Before that took place, a man of tall stature and solemn gait stepped 
up
and stood upon the brink of the little excavation.

     For a time he was as still as that sad occupant of the little space of
earth that served her for a resting place, but at length in a tone of deep
anguish he spoke, --

     "And has it come to this?" he said, "is this my work?  Oh, horror! 
horror
unspeakable.  In this some hideous dream or a reality of tragedy, so far
transcending all I looked for, that if I had tears I should shed them now; 
but
I have none.  A hundred years ago that fount was dry.  I thought that I had
steeled my heart against all gentle impulses; that I had crushed-- aye,
completely crushed dove-eyed pity in my heart, but it is not so, and still
sufficient of my once human feelings clings to me to make me grieve for 
thee,
Clara Crofton, thou victim!"

     We need not tell our readers now, that it was no other than Varney the
Vampyre himself from whom these words came.

     After thus, then, giving such fervent utterance to the sad feeling that
had overcome him, he stood for a time silent, and then glancing around him 
as
well as he could by the dim light, he found the spades, by the aid of which
the grave had been dug, and which the men had in their great fight [sic] 
left
behind them.

     Seizing one, he commenced, with an energy and perseverance that was 
well
adapted to accomplish the object, to fill up the grave.

     "You shall now rest in peace," he said.

     In the course of about ten minutes the grave was levelled completely, 
so
that there were no signs or indications of any one having been there 
interred.

     The rain was still falling, and notwithstanding that circumstance, he
continued at his work, until he had stamped down the earth to a perfect 
level;
and then, even, as if he was still further anxious to thoroughly destroy any
indication of the deed that had been done, he took the loose earth that was
superfluous, and scattered it about.

     "This done," he said, "surely you will now know peace."

     He cast down the spade with which he had been working, and lingered for 
a
few brief moments.  Suddenly he started, for he heard, or thought he heard, 
an
approaching footstep.

     His first impulse appeared to be to fly, but that he soon corrected, 
and
folding his arms solemnly across his breast, he waited for the man that was
now evidently making speed towards that spot.

     In a few moments more he saw the dusky outline of the figure, and then
Mr. Bevan, the clergyman, stood before him.

     Mr. Bevan did not at the moment recognize in the form before him the 
man
who had been the guest of Sir George Crofton, and from whom it was supposed
had sprung all he mischief and horror that hsad fallen upon the family, at 
the
Grange.

     "Who are you?" he cried; "can you give me information of an outrage 
that
has been committed hereabouts."

     "Many," said Varney.

     "Ah! I know the voice.  Are you not he who was rescued from the sea by
the two sons of Sir George Crofton."

     "Well."

     "Now I know you, and I am glad to have met with you."

     "You will try to kill me?"

     "No, no-- peace is my profession."

     "Ah! you are the priest of this place.  Well, sir, what would you with
me?"

     "I would implore you to tell me if it be really true that-- that--"

     Mr. Bevan paused, for he disliked to show that the fear that it might 
be
true there were such creatures as vampyres, had taken so strong a hold of 
him.

     "Proceed," said Varney.

     "I will.  Are you then a vampyre?"

     "A strange question for one living man to put to another!  Are you?"

     "You are inclined to trifle with me.  But I implore you to answer me.  
I
am perhaps the only man in all this neighbourhood to whom you can give an
answer in the affirmative with safety."

     "And why so?"

     "Because I question not the decrees of Heaven.  If it seems fit to the
great Ruler of Heaven and of earth that there should be ever such horrible
creatures as vampyres, ought I his creature to question it?"

     "You ought not-- you ought not.  I have heard much from priests, but 
from
your lips I hear sound reason.  I am a vampyre."

     Mr. Bevan shrunk back, and shook for a moment, as he said in a low
faltering tone, --

     "For how long-- have you--"

     "You would know how long I have endured such a state of existence.  I
will tell you that I have a keen remembrance of being hunted through the
streets of London in the reign of Henry the Fourth."

     "Henry the Fourth?"

     "Yes, I have seen all the celebrities of this and many other lands from
that period.  More than once have I endeavoured to cast off this horrible
existence, but it is my destiny to remain in it.  I was picked up by the
brothers Crofton after one of my attempts to court death.  They have been
repaid."

     "Horribly!"

     "I cannot help it-- I am what I am."

     There was a strange and mournful solemnity about the tones of Varney 
that
went to the heart of Mr. Bevan, and after a few moments pause, he said, --

     "You greatly, very greatly awake my interest.  Do not leave me.  Ask
yourself if there is anything that I can do to alleviate your destiny.  Have
you tried prayer?"

     "Prayer?"

     "Yes.  Oh! there is great virtue in prayer."

     "I pray?  What for should I pray but for that death which whenever it
seems to be in my grasp has them flitted from me in mockery, leaving me 
still
a stranded wretch upon the shores of this world.  Perhaps you have at times
fancied you have suffered some great amount of mental agony.  Perhaps you
have stood by the bed-side of dying creatures, and heard them howl their
hopelessness of Heaven's mercy, but you cannot know-- you cannot imagine--
what I have suffered."

     As he spoke, he turned away, but Mr. Bevan followed him, saying, --

     "Remain-- remain, I implore you,"

     "Remain-- and wherefore?"

     "I will be your friend-- it is my duty to be such; remain, and you 
shall
if you wish it, have an asylum in my house.  If you will not pray yourself, 
to
Heaven, I will pray for you, and in time to come you will have some hope.  
Oh,
believe me, earnest prayer is not in vain."

     "My friend!"

     "Yes, your friend; I am, I ought to be the friend of all who are
unhappy."

     "And is there really one human being who does not turn from me in 
horror
and disgust?  Oh, sir, you jest."

     "No-- on my soul, that which I say I mean.  Come with me now, and you
shall if you please, remain in secret in my house-- no one shall know you 
are
with me-- from the moment that you cross the threshold you shall hope for
happier days."

     The vampyre paused, and it was evident that he was deeply affected by
what Mr. Bevan said to him, for his whole frame shook.

                               [Chapter 226]

THE STRANGE GUEST. -- THE LITTLE CHAPEL. -- VARNEY'S NARRATIVE.


     Mr. Bevan could not but see that he had made some impression, even upon
the obdurate heart of Varney, and he was determined to follow that 
impression
up by [e]very means in his power.

     "Always have in mind," he said, that by trusting me, you trust one who 
is
not in the habit of condemning his fellows.  You will be safe from anything
like sanctified reproach, for to my thinking, religion should be a principle
of love and tenderness, and not a subject upon which people who, perhaps are
themselves liable and obnoxious to all sorts of reproach, should deal forth
denunciations against their neighbours."

     "Is that indeed your faith?"

     "It is; and it is the real faith, taught by my Great Master."

     "You are as one among many thousands."

     "Nay, you may have been unfortunate in meeting with bad specimens of
those who are devoted in the priesthood.  Do not condemn hastily."

     "Hastily!  I have been some hundreds of years in condemning."

     "You will come with me."

     "I will for once again put faith in human nature."

     "Tell me then, before we leave this spot, if you know aught of what has
happened to, or become of the body of Clara Croton."

     "I can tell you; it was left here buried, but uncovered."

     "Indeed-- the ground is level, and I see no trace of a grave."

     "No; I have obliterated all such traces, I have placed the earth upon
her-- may she now rest in peace.  Oh, that such a flower should have been so
rudely plucked, and I the cause.  Is not that enough to make Heaven's angels
mutiny if I should essay to pass the golden gates."

     "Say no more of that.  I thank God that the body is so disposed of, and
that it will not come in the way of any of the Crofton family.  This affair
had far better now be let sink into oblivion-- alas! poor Sir George is now
the most pitiable sufferer."

     "Indeed!"

     "Yes; madness has seized upon him.  He only sits and smiles to himself,
weaving in his imagination strange fancies."

     "And call you that unhappy?"

     "It is called, and considered so."

     "Oh, fatal error-- he is happy.  Reason! boasted, God-like reason-- 
what
are you but the curse of poor humanity.  The maniac, who will in his cell,
fancy it a gorgeous hall, and of the damp straw that is his couch make up a
glittering coronet, is a king indeed, and most happy."

     "This is poetical," said Mr. Bevan, "if not true[.]"

     "It is true."

     "Well, well; we will talk on that as well as other themes at our 
leisure.
Come on, and I will at once take you to my home, where you wil be safe, and 
I
hope more happy."

     "Are you not afraid?"

     "I am not."

     "You are right, confidence is safety-- lead on, sir, I'll follow you,
although I little thought to make any human companionship to-night."

     Mr. Bevan walked only about a step in advance as they proceeded towards
the parsonage house, and on the way he conversed with Varney with calmness
which considering the very perculiar circumstances, few men could have 
brought
to bear upon the occasion.

     But Mr. Bevan was no common man.  He looked upon nature, and all the
living creatures that make up its vital portion with peculiar eyes, and if 
the
bishop of his diocese had known one half of what Mr. Bevan thought, he would
not have suffered him to remain in his religious situation.

     But he kept the mass of his liberal opinions to himself, although he
alwasys acted upon them, and a man more completely free from sectarian 
dogmas,
and illiberal fancies of superstition, which are nicknamed faith, could not
be.

     There was still, notwithstanding all the circumstances, a hope 
lingering
in his mind that Varney might after all not be even what he thought himself 
to
be, but some enthusiast who had dreamt himself into a belief of his own
horrible powers.

     We know that such was not the case.  But it was natural enough for Mr.
Bevan to hold as long as he could by such an idea.

     And so those two most strangly assorted beings, the clergyman and the
vampyre, walked together towards the pretty and picturesque dwelling of the
former.

     "The distance is short," said Mr. Bevan.

     "Nay, that matters not," replied Varney.

     "I spoke because I thought you seemed fatigued."

     "No, my frame is of iron.  My heart is bowed down with many griefs, but
the physical structure knows no feeling of dejection.  The life I possess is
no common one.  Oh! would that it were so, that I might shuffle it off as 
any
ordinary men can do."

     "Do not say that.  Who knows but that after all your living 
accomplishes
better things?"

     "I cannot say that it accomplishes aught completely but one thing."

     "And that?"

     "That is my most exquisite misery."

     "Even that may pass away.  But here we are at my little garden gate.
Come in, and fear nothing; for if you will seek Heaven, as I would wish you,
you will find this place such a haven of peace, and such a refuge against 
the
storms of life, as you hardly fancied existed, I dare say, in this world."

     "Not for me.  I did not fancy that there existed a spot on earth on 
which
I could lie down in peace, and yet it may be here."

 Next Time: Varney Opens the Vast Store-house of his Memory.



                             CHAPTER CXCVII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 227]

VARNEY OPENS THE VAST STORE-HOUSE OF HIS MEMORY.


     A more singular conversation than that which took place between Varney,
the Vampyre, and this minister of religion, could not be conceived.  If 
there
was any one particle of goodness existing in Varney's disposition, we may
suspect it would now be developed.

     Perhaps the whole domestic history of the world never yet exhibited so
remarkable an association as that between Mr. Bevan and Varney; and when 
they
sat down together in the little cheerful study of the former, never had four
walls enclosed two beings of the same species, and yet of such opposite
pursuits.

     But we can hardly call Varney, the Vampyre, human-- his space of
existence had been lengthened out beyond the ordinary routine of human
existence, and the kind of vitality that he now enjoyed, if one might be
allowed the expression, was something distinct and peculiar.

     It speaks volumes, however, for the philantrophy and liberality of the
minister of any religion who could hold out the hand of fellowship to so
revolting and to so horrible an existence.

     But Mr. Bevan was no common man.  His religion was doctrinal, 
certainly,
but it was free from bigotry; and his charity to the feelings, opinions, and
prejudices of others was immense.

     He was accustomed to say "may not my feelings be prejudices," and one 
of
the sublimest precepts of the whole Scriptures was to him that which says,
"Judge not, lest ye, too, should be judged."

     Hence it was that he would not allow himself to revolt at Varney.  It 
had
seemed right to the great Creator of all things that there should be such a
being, and therefore, he, Mr. Bevan, would neither question nor contemn it.

     "Look about you," he said to Varney with a disordered gaze; "you seem 
to
look very about you as if there was danger in the atmosphere you breathe, 
but
be assured you are safe here; it shall be my life for your life if any harm
should be attempted to be done you."

     Varney looked at him for a few moments silence, and then in his deep 
and
sepulchral voice he spoke, saying, --

     "My race is run."

     "What mean you by that expression?"

     "I mean I shall no longer be a terror to the weak, nor a curiosity to 
the
strong.  In time past, more than once I have tried to shuffle off the evil 
of
this frightful existence, but some accident, strange, wild, and wonderful, 
has
brought me back to life again."

     "Perhaps not an accident," said Mr. Bevan.

     "You may be right, but when I have sought to rid the world of my own 
bad
company, I have been moved to do so by some act of kindness and 
consideration,
most contrary to my deserts; and then again when I have been cast back by 
the
waves of fate upon the shores of existence, my heart is burdened, and I have
begun to plan to work mischief and misery and woe to all."

     "I can understand how your feelings have alternated, but I hope that 
out
association will have better result."

     "Yes, a better result, for with consumate art, with cool perseverance 
and
extended knowledge, I trust I may think of some means which cannot fail of
changing this living frame to that dust from which it sprung, and to which 
it
should long since have returned."

     "You believe in that, but do you not think there is a pure spirit that
will yet live, independent of the grovelling earth?"

     "There are times when I have hoped that even that fable were true; but
you have promised me rest, will you keep your word?"

     "That will I most certainly; but will you keep yours?  You have 
promised
me some details of your extraordinary existence, and as a divine, and I hope
in some degree as a philosopher, I look for them with some degree of 
anxiety."

     "You shall have them-- leave me pens, ink and paper, and in the 
solitude
of this room, until to-morrow morning, and you shall have what I believe to 
be
the origin of this most horrible career."

     "Your wishes shall be consulted-- but, will you not take refreshment?"

     "Nothing-- nothing.  My refreshment is one I need not name to you, and
when forced by the world's customs and considerations of my own safety, I 
have
partaken of man's usual food, if has but ill accorded with my preternatural
existence, I eat not-- drink not-- here.  You know me as I am."

     As he continued speaking, Varney evidently grew weaker, and Mr. Bevan
could scarcely persuade himself that it was not through actual want of
nourishment, but the Vampyre assured him that it was not so, and that rest
would recruit him, to which opinion, as the experience of human nature
generally afforded no index to Varney's peculiar habits, he was forced to
subscribe.

     There was a couch in the room, and upon that Varney laid himself, and 
as
he seemed indisposed for further conversation, Mr. Bevan left him, promising
to return to him as he himself requested in the morning, with the hope of
finding that he had completed some sort of narrative to the effect 
mentioned.

     It can scarcely be said that Mr. Bevan had thoroughly made up his mind 
to
leave his guest for so long a period, and as there was a window that looked
from the study in his little garden, he thought, that by now and then 
peeping
in, to see that all was right, he could scarcely be considered as breaking
faith with his mysterious guest.

     "He will surely attempt nothing against his own life," thought Mr. 
Bevan,
"for already he seems to be impressed with the futility of such an attempt,
and to think that when he has made them he has been made the sport of
circumstances that had forced him back to life again, despite all his wishes
to the contrary."

     Mr. Bevan reasoned thus, but he little knew what was passing in the 
mind
of Varney the Vampire.

     After about two hours more, when the night was profoundly dark, the
liberal-minded but anxious clergyman went into his garden, for the purpose 
of
peeping into his study, and he then saw, as he supposed, his visitor lying
enveloped in his large brown cloak, lying upon the couch.

     He was better pleased to see he was sleeping, and recovering from the
great fatigue of which he complained, instead of writing, although that
writing promised to be of so interesting a character, and he crept softly
away for fear of awakening him.

     The hour had now arrived at which Mr. Bevan usually retired to rest, 
but
he delayed doing so, and let two hours more elapse, after which, he again
stole out of his garden, and peeped into the study.

     There lay the long, gaunt, slumbering figure upon the couch.

     "I am satisfied," said Mr. Bevan to himself; "fatigue has completely
overcome him, and he will sleep till morning now.  I long much to become
acquainted with his strange eventful history."

     After this, Mr. Bevan retired to rest, but not until in prayer he had
offered up his thanks, and stated his hopes of being able to turn aside from
the wicked path he had been pursuing, the wretched man who at that moment 
was
slumbering peacefully beneath his roof.

     We should have less of opposition to churchmen, if they were all like 
Mr.
Bevan, and not the wily, ravenous, illiberal, grasping crew they really are.
There was no priestcraft in him, he was almost enough to make one in love 
with
his doctrines, be they what they might, so that they were his.

     Although we say that he retired to rest, we should more properly say he
retired to try to rest; for, after all, there were feelings of excitement 
and
anxiety about him which he could not repress wholly; and although he had 
every
reason to believe his guest was sleeping, and clamly sleeping too, yet he
found he was becoming painfully alive to the slightest sound.

     He became nervously alive to the least interruption, and kept fancying
that he heard the slightest indications of movements in the house, such as 
at
any other time he would have paid no attention to.

     It always happened too, provokingly, that just as he was dropping into 
a
slight slumber, that he thought he heard one of these noises, and then he
would start, awake, and sit up in his bed, and listen attentively, until 
tired
nature forced him to repose again.

     Those who have passed such a night of watchfulness need not be told how
very very exciting it becomes, and hour after hour becomes more intense and
acute, and the power of escaping its fell influence less and less.

     Indeed, it was not until the dawn of morning that Mr. Bevan tasted the
sweets of sound repose, then, as is generally usual after nights of fever 
and
disquietude, the cool, pure, life-giving air of early morn, produced quite a
different state of feeling, and his repose was calm and serene.

 Next Time: The Flight of the Vampyre. -- The Mass.




                             CHAPTER CCXI. [sic]

                               [Chapter 228]

THE FLIGHT OF THE VAMPYRE. -- THE MASS.


     As was to be expected, in consequence of the sleepless state in which 
he
had been in the early part of the night, Mr. Bevan did not awaken at his
usually early hour; and as his confidential servant had stolen into his room
upon tip-toe, and seeing that the [sic] was sleeping quietly and soundly, 
she
did not think proper to disturb him.

     An autumnal sun was gleaming into his lattice window when he
spontaneously awoke, and the reflection of the sunlight upon a particular
portion of the wall convinced him that it was late.

     For a moment or two, he lay in that dreamy state when we are just
conscious of where we are, without having the smallest pretensions to 
another
idea; and probably he would have dropped to sleep again had it not been that
his servant again opened the door, the lock of which had the infirmity of
giving a peculiar snap every time it was used, and that thoroughly awakened
him.

     "Oh, you are awake, sir?" said his old servant, "I never knew you sleep
so long.  Breakfast has been ready an hour and a half.  It's a cool morning,
sir, and what's worse, I can't get into your study to light you a bit of 
fire,
which I thought you would want."

     The interruption altogether, and the mention of the study, served
completely to arouse Mr. Bevan to a remembrance of the events of the 
preceding
evening, and he cried, --

     "What's the time?  What's the time?"

     "It's after nine, and as for the study-- "

     "Never mind the study-- never mind the study, I will be down directly."

     Scarcely ever had Mr. Bevan dressed himself with such precipitation as 
he
now did.

     "How provoking," he thought, "that upon this particular occasion, when 
I
should like to have been up and stirring earlier than usual, I am a good 
hour
and a half later.  It can't be helped though, and if my guest of last night 
is
to be credited, he won't be waiting for his breakfast."

     The simple toilet of the kind-hearted clergyman was soon completed, and
then he ran down stairs to the lower part of his house, and finding that his
servant was in the kitchen, he thought he might at once proceed to his 
study,
to speak to the extraordinary inmate.

     He had furnished Varney with the means of locking himself in for the
night, and it would seem that the vampyre had fully availed himself of those
means, for when Mr. Bevan tried the door, he found himself as much at fault 
as
his servant had been, and could not by any means effect an admittance.

     "He said his fatigue was great," remarked Mr. Bevan, "and so it seems 
it
was, for surely he is yet sleeping.  It is a comfort when one oversleeps
oneself that the necessity for one's rising has been put off by the same
means."

     Unwilling to disturb Varney, and not hearing from the slightest 
movement
from within that he had yet done so, Mr. Bevan went to his breakfast, much
better satisfied than he had been a quarter of an hour since, and as the
breakfast room adjoined the study, he had every opportunity if the vampyre
should be stirring, of hearing and attending to him.

     Not above ten minutes elapsed in this kind of way, when Mr. Bevan,
although he saw nothing of his guest, heard something of the approach of a
visitor, by the trampling of feet upon the gravel walk, and upon looking
through the window, he saw that it was his friend Sir George Crofton from 
the
hall.

     It was rather an early hour for visitors, but still under the peculiar
circumstances, Sir George might be supposed not to stand upon ceremony in
calling upon the clegyman of his parish and upon his old friend, combining, 
as
Mr. Bevan did, both these characters in one.

     It was rather, though, placing the clergyman in a situation of
difficulty, for while there was nothing he so much hated as mystery and
concealment, he yet could not, upon the spur of the moment, decide whether 
he
ought to inform Sir George of the presence of Varney or not.

     After the frightful manner in which the baronet and his family had
suffered from what might be called the machinations of the vampyre, it could
scarcely be supposed that his feelings were otherwise than in a most
exasperated state, and it might, for all he knew, be actually dangerous for
the personal safety of that guest whom he had pledged his honour to protect,
to allow Sir George Crofton to know at all that he was beneath his roof.

     While he was engaged in these considerations, and before he could come 
to
anything like a conclusion concerning them, Sir George was announced, and
shown as a privileged visitor into the parlour.

     We cannot but pause to make a remark upon the stupendous change that 
had
taken place in the appearance of that unhappy man.  When first we presented
him to the reader, he was as good a specimen of the hale hearty English
gentleman, as we could wish to see; good humour and good health beamed forth
on every feature of his face; and well they might do so, for although the 
past
had not been unchequered by trials, the future wore to him a sunny aspect, 
and
some of the feelings of his youth were returning to him, in the happiness of
his children.

     But what a change was now.  Twenty years of ordinary existence, with
extraordinary vicissitudes, would scarcely have produced the effect that the
events of the last fortnight had upon that unhappy father.

     He appeared to be absolutely sinking into the grave with grief, and not
only was his countenance strangely altered, but the tones of his voice were
completely changed from what they had been.

     Alas! poor Sir George Crofton, never will the light of joy again 
illumine
your face.  There are griefs, inevitable griefs, which time will heal, 
griefs
which the more we look upon them the more we find our reason array itself
against them.  But his sorrows were of a different complexion, and were apt 
to
grow more gigantic from thought.

     "Good morning, Mr. Bevan," he said, "I am an early visitor, sir."

     "Not more early than welcome, Sir George.  I pray you to be seated."

     "You are very good," said the baronet, "but when one comes at an hour
like this, I am of opinion that he ought to come with something like a good
excuse for his intrusion."

     "There is none needed, I assure you."

     "But I have been thinking upon the advice which you have given me, Mr.
Bevan, to leave this part of the country, and try the endeavour, by the
excitement and changes of foreign travel, to lessen the weight of my
calamities."

     "I think your determination is a good one, Sir George."

     "Probably it is the best I could adopt, but I must confess that I 
should
set about it in better spirit, but I am haunted by apprehensions."

     "Apprehensions, Sir George! is not the worst passed?"

     "It may be, and I hope to Heaven it is, but I have another child, 
another
daughter, fair and beautiful as my lost Clara; but what security have I that
that dreadful being may not pursue her, and with frightful vindictiveness
drive her to the grave."

     Mr. Bevan was silent two or three minutes, and the idea crossed him 
that
if he could get Sir George in the proper state of mind, it would be, 
perhaps,
better that he should know that the vampyre was in the house, and in such a
state of mind as not to renew any outrages against him or his family, than
that he should go abroad with the dread clinging to him of being still
followed and persecuted by that dreadful being.

     "Sir George," said Mr. Bevan, in an extremely serious voice, "Sir 
George,
did you ever reason with yourself calmly and seriously, and in a Christian
spirit, about this affair."

     "Calmly, Mr. Bevan! how could I reason calmly?"

     "I have scarcely put my question as I ought; what I meant to ask was,
what are your personal feelings towards the vampyre?  We must recollect that
even he, dreadful existence as he is, was fashioned by the same God that
fashioned us; and who shall say but he may be the victim of a horrible and
stern necessity?  Who shall say but he may be tortured by remorse, and that
the circumstances connected with your daughter, of which you so justly
complain, may be to him sources of the bitterest reflection?  What if you 
were
to be assured that never more would that mysterious man cross your path, if
man we can call him?  Do you think that you could then forgive him?"

     "It is hard to say, but the feeling that my other child was safe would
prompt me much."

     "Sir George, I could make a communication to you if I thought you would
listen to it patiently; if you will swear to me to be calm."

     "I swear, tell me-- oh, tell me!"

     "The vampyre is in this house."

 Next Time: The Mysterious Disappearance.




                             CHAPTER CCXII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 229]

THE MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE.


     One may form some sort of judgment of the astonishment with which Sir
George Crofton heard this statement.  He looked indeed a few moments at Mr.
Bevan, as if he had a stong suspicion that he could not possibly have heard
aright, so that the good clergyman was induced to repeat his statement, 
which
he did, by saying, --

     "Sir George, I assure you, however remarkable such a circumstance may 
be,
and however much you may feel yourself surprised at it, that in the extreme
bitterness of spirit, and feeling all the compunction that you could 
possibly
wish him to feel, Varney the Vampyre is now an inmate of this house."

     Had a bomb-shell fallen at his feet, Sir George Crofton could not have
felt more surprised, and he exhibited that surprise by several times 
repeating
to himself, --

     "Varney the Vampyre an inmate of this house!  Varney the Vampyre here!"

     "Yes," said Mr. Bevan, "here, an inmate of this house.  He is within a
few paces of you, slumbering in the next apartment, and from his own lips 
you
shall have the assurance that never again will you have any trouble on his
account, and that he most bitterly and most deeply regrets the suffering he
had brought upon you and yours."

     "Will that regret," said Sir George, excitedly, "restore the dead?  
Will
that regret give me my child again?  Will it open the portals of the grave,
and restore her to me who was the life and joy of my existence?  Tell me, 
will
it do that?  If not, what is his regret to me?"

     "No, Sir George, no, his regret will not do that.  There is such power,
but it is not upon earth.  Heaven delegates not such fearful 
responsibilities
to any of its creatures, and the only reason which has induced me to make 
this
confidence was to take from you the fearful anxiety of fancying yourself
followed by that dreadful being."

     "Vengeance," replied Sir George Crofton, "vengeance shall be mine.  In
the name of my lost child, I cry for vengeance.  Shall he not perish who has
made her whom I love perish?  Make way, Mr. Bevan, make way."

     "No, Sir George, no, this is my house.  I, as a Christian minister,
offered the hospitality of its roof to Varney the Vampyre, and I cannot
violate my word."

     "You speak, sir, to a desperate man," cried "Sir George; "no roof to me
is sanctified, beneath which the murderer of my child finds a shelter.  Mr.
Bevan, the respect that one man has for another, or ever has had for 
another,
cannot exceed the respect I have for you; but with all that, sir, I cannot
forget my own personal wrongs; the shade of my murdered Clara beckons me."

     "Fly, Varney, fly," cried Mr. Bevan, "fly."

     "Is it so?" said Sir George; "do you then side with my direst foe?"

     "No-- no, I side with Sir George Croton against his own furious 
unbridled
passions."

     Neither from profession nor practice was Mr. Bevan one who was likely 
to
force to resist Sir George, and at the moment the baronet was about to lay
hands upon him to hurl him from his path, he slipped aside.

     "Rash man," he said, "the time will come when you will repent this 
deed."

     The door of the study was still fast, but to the infuriated Sir George,
that opposed but a very frail obstacle, and with the effort of a moment he
forced it open, and rushed into the apartment.

     "Varney, monster," he cried, "prepare to meet your doom.  Your career 
is
at an end."

     Mr. Bevan was after him, and in the room with him in a moment, fully
expecting that some very dreadful scene would ensue, as a consequence of the
unbridled passion of Sir George Crofton.

     Sir George Crofton was standing in the centre of the apartment with
Varney's large brown cloak in his grasp, which he had dragged from the sofa,
but the vampyre himself was not to be seen.

     "Escaped!" he cried, "escaped!"

     "Thank Heaven, then," said Mr. Bevan, "that this roof has not been
desecrated by an act of violence.  Oh, Sir George, it is a mercy that time 
has
been given to think he has escaped."

     "I'll follow him, were it to perdition."

     Sir George was about to open the window and rush into the garden,
thinking, of course, it was by that means by which the vampyre escaped, but
Mr. Bevan laid his hand upon the smooth gravel path that was immediately 
below
the casement.

     "Behold," he said, "one of the first results of an autumnal night.  
That
this coating of fleecy sleet, you see, is undisturbed;p it fell about
midnight; nine hours have since elapsed, and you perceive there is no foot
mark upon it, and in what direction would you chase Varney the Vampyre while
he has such a start of you?"

     Infuriated with passion, as was Sir George Crofton, the reasonableness 
of
this statement struck him forcibly, and he became silent.  A revulsion of
feeling took place; he staggered to a seat, and wept.

     "Yes, he is gone," he said.  "Yes, the murderer of my child is gone;
vengeance is delayed, but perhaps not altogether stopped.  Oh, Mr. Bevan, 
Mr.
Bevan, why did you tell me he was here?"

     "I do now regret having done so, but I believed him to be here, and his
departure is as mysterious to me as it can be to you."

     Mr. Bevan cast his eyes upon the table, and there he saw a large packet
addressed to himself.  Sir George saw it too, at the same moment, and 
pointing
to it, said, --

     "Is that the vampyre's legacy to his new friend?"

     "Sir George," said Mr. Bevan, "let it suffice that the packet is
addressed to me."

     All the good breeding of the gentleman returned, and Sir George Crofton
bowed as he left the room, closely followed by the clergyman, who was as 
much
bewildered by the disappearance of Varney as even Sir George could possibly
be.  He had a most intense desire to examine the packet, with the hope that
there he should find some explanation or solution of the mystery; but not
being aware, of course, of what it contained, he could not tell if it would 
be
prudent to trust Sir George at that time with its contents.

     As may be well supposed, there was a sort of restraint in the manner of
both of them after what had happened, and they did what was very rare with
them both, parted without making any appointment for the future.

     But whatever might be the feelings of Sir George Crofton then, a little
reflection would be quite sure to bring him back again to a proper 
estimation
of what was due to such a friend as Mr. Bevan, and we cannot anticipate any
serious interruption to their general friendly intercourse.

     The moment the clergyman found himself alone, he with eager steps went
into his study, and eagerly seized upon the packet that was left to him by 
the
vampyre, the outside of which merely bore the superscription of -- "These to
the Rev. Mr. Bevan, and strictly private."

     With eagerness he tore open the envelope, and the first thing that
attracted his attention was a long, narrow slip of paper, on which were
written the following words: --

     "It was not my intention to trespass largely upon your hospitality; it
would have been unjust-- almost approaching to criminality so to do.  I 
could
only think of taking a brief refuge in your house, so brief as should just
enable me to avail myself of the shadows of night to escape from a
neighbourhood where I knew I should be hunted.

     "The few hours which I have quietly remianed beneath your roof have 
been
sufficient to accomplish that object, and the we papers that I leave you
accompanying this, contain the personal information concerning me you asked.
They had been previously prepared, and are at your service.

     "To attempt to follow me would be futile, for I have as ample means of
making a rapid journey as you could possibly call to your aid, and I have 
the
advantage of many hours' start; unter these circumstances I have no 
hesitation
in telling you that my destination is Naples, and that perhaps the next you
hear of me will be, that some stranger in a fit of madness has cast himself
into the crater of a burning mountain, which would at once consume him and 
all
his sorrows.

                              "VARNEY THE VAMPYRE."

     One may imagine the feelings with which Mr. Bevan read this most 
strange
and characteristic epistle -- feelings that for some moments kept him a
prisoner to the most painful thoughts.

     All that he had hoped to accomplish by the introduction of Varney to 
his
house was lost now.  He had but in fact given him a better opportunity of
carrying out a terrible design -- a design which now there really did not
appear to be any means of averting the consummation of.

     "Alas! alas!" he said, "this is most grievous, and what can I do now, 
to
avert the mischief-- nothing, absolutely nothing.  If it be true that he 
has,
as he says he has, the means of hastening on his journey, all pursuit would
be utterly useless."

     This was taking a decidedly correct view of the matter.  Varney was not
the sort of man, if he really intended to reach Naples quickly, to linger on
his route, and then there was another view of the subject which could not 
but
occur to Mr. Bevan, and that was, that his mentioned destination might be 
but
a blind to turn off pursuit.

 Next Time: Varney Gives Some Personal Account of Himself.




                             CHAPTER CCXIII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 230]

VARNEY GIVES SOME PERSONAL ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF.


     Never had Mr. Bevan in all his recollection been in such a state of
hesitation as now.

     He was a man usually of rapid resolves, and very energetic action; but
the circumstances that had recently taken place were of so very remarkable a
nature, that he was not able to bring to bear upon them any [po]rtion of his
past experience.

     He felt that he could come to no determination, but was compelled by 
the
irresistible force of events to be a spectator instead of an actor in what
might ensue.

     "I shall hear," he thought, "if any such event happens at Naples as 
that
to which Varney has adverted, and until I do so, or until a sufficient 
length
of time has elapsed to make me feel certain that he will not plunge into 
that
burning abyss, I shall be a prey to every kind of fear; and then again as
regards Sir George Crofton.  What am I to say to him?  Shall I show him this
note or not?"

     Even that was a question which he could not absolutely decide in his 
own
mind, although he was strongly inclined to think that it would be highly
desirable to do so, and while he was considering the point, and holding the
note in his hand, his eye fell upon the other papers which had been enclosed
with it, and addressed to him.

     Hoping and expecting that there he should find something that would
better qualify him to come to an accurate conclusion, he took up the packet,
and found that the topmost paper bore the following endorsement: --

     "SOME PARTICULARS CONCERNING MY OWN LIFE."

     "There, then," said Mr. Bevan, "is [w]hat he has promised me."

     It was to be expected that Mr. Bevan should take up those papers with a
very considerable amount of curiosity, and as he could not think what course
immediately to pursue that would do good to Varney or anybody else, he 
thought
he had better turn his attention at once to the documents that the vampyre 
had
left to his perusal.

     Telling his servant, then, not to allow him to be disturbed unless the
affair was a very urgent one indeed, he closed the door of his study, and
commenced reading one of the most singular statements that ever created 
being
placed upon paper.  It was as follows: --

         *             *             *             *             *

     During my brief intercourse -- and it has always been brief when of a
confidential nature with various persons -- I have created surprise by 
talking
of individuals and events long since swallowed up in the almost forgotten
past.  In these few pages I declare myself more fully.

     In the reign of the First Charles, I resided in a narrow street, in the
immediate neighbourhood of Whitehall.  It was a straggling, tortuous
thoroughfare, going down to the Thames; it matters little what were my means
of livelihood, but I have no hesitation in saying that I was a well-paid 
agent
in some of the political movements which graced and disgraced that period.

     London was then a mass of mean-looking houses; with here and there one
that looked like a palace, compared with its humbler neighbours.  Almost 
every
street appeared to be under the protection of some great house situated
somewhere in its extent, but such of those houses as have survived the wreck
of time rank now with their neighbours, and are so strangely altered, that 
I,
who knew many of them well, could now scarcely point to the place where they
used to stand.

     I took no prominent part in the commotions of that period, but I saw 
the
head of a king held up in its gore at Whitehall as a spectacle for the
multitude.

     There were thousands of persons in England who had aided to bring about
that result, but who were very far from expecting it, and who were the first
to fall under the ban of the gigantic power they had themselves raised.

     Among these were many of my employers; men, who had been quite willing 
to
shake the stability of a throne so far as the individual occupying it was
concerned; but who certainly never contemplated the destruction of monarchy;
so the death of the First Charles, and the dictatorship of Cromwell, made
royalists in abundance.

     They had raised a spirit they could not quell again, and this was a 
fact
which the stern, harsh man, Cromwell, with whom I had many interviews, was
aware of.

     My house was admirably adapted for the purposes of secrecy and 
seclusion,
and I became a thriving man from the large sums I received for aiding the
escape of distinguished loyalists, some of whom lay for a considerable time
_perdu_ at my house, before an eligible opportunity arrived of dropping down
the river quietly to some vessel which would take them to Holland.

     It was to offer me so much per head for these royalists that Cromwell
sent for me, and there was one in particular who had been private secretary 
to
the Duke of Cleveland, a young man merely, of neither family nor rank, but 
of
great ability, whom Cromwell was exceedingly anxious to capture.

     I think there likewise must have been some private reasons which 
induced
the dictator of the Commonwealth to be so anxious concerning this Master
Francis Latham, which was the name of the person alluded to.

     It was late one evening when a stranger came to my house, and having
desired to see me, was shown into a private apartment, when I immediately
waited upon him.

     "I am aware," he said, "that you have been confidentially employed by 
the
Duke of Cleveland, and I am aware that you have been very useful to 
distressed
loyalists, but in aiding Master Francis Latham, the duke's secretary, you 
will
be permitted almost to name your own terms."

     I named a hundred pounds, which at that time was a much larger sum than
now, taking into consideration the relative value.  One half of it was paid 
to
me at once, and the other promised within four-and-twenty hours after Latham
had effected his escape.

     I was told that at half-past twelve o'clock that night, a man dressed 
in
common working apparel, and with a broom over his shoulder would knock at my
door and ask if he could be recommended to a lodging, and that by those 
tokens
I should know him to be Francis Latham.  A Dutch lugger, I was further told,
was lying near Gravesend, on board of which, to earn my money, I was 
expected
to place the fugitive.

     All this was duly agreed upon; I had a boat in readiness, with a couple
of watermen upon whom I could depend, and I was far from anticipating any
extraordinary difficulties in carrying out the enterprise.

     I had a son about twelve years of age, who being a sharp acute lad, I
found very useful upon several occasions, and I never scrupled to make him
acquainted with any such affair as this that I am recounting.

     Half-past twelve o'clock came, and in a very few minutes after that
period of time there came a knock at my door, which my son answered, and
according to arrangement, there was the person with a broom, who asked to be
recommended to a lodging, and who was immediately requested to walk in.

     He seemed rather nervous, and asked me if I thought there was much 
risk.

     "No," said I, "no more than ordinary risk in all these cases, but we 
must
wait half an hour 'till the tide turns.  For just now to struggle against it
down the river would really be nothing else but courting observation."

     To this he perfectly agreed, and sat down by my fireside.

     I was as anxious as he to get the affair over, for it was a ticklish 
job,
and Oliver Cromwell, if he had brought anything of the kind exactly home to
me, would as life order me to be shot as he would have taken his luncheon in
the name of the Lord.

     I accordingly went down to the water-side to speak to the men who were
lying there with the boat, and had ascertained from them that in about 
twenty
minutes the tide would begin to ebb in the centre of the stream, when two 
men
confronted me.

     Practised as I was in the habits and appearances of the times, I 
guessed
at once who they were.  In fact, a couple of Oliver Cromwell's dismounted
dragoons were always well known.

     "You are wanted," said one of them to [me."]

     "Yes, you are particularly wanted," said the other.

     "But, gentlemen, I am rather busy," said I.  "In an hour's time I will 
do
myself the pleasure, if you please, of waiting upon you anywhere you wish to
name."

     The only reply they made to this was the practical one, of getting on
each side of me, and then hurrying me on, past my own door.

     I was taken right away to St. James's at a rapid pace, being hurried
through one of the court yards; we paused at a small door, at which was a
sentinel.

     My two guides communicated something to him, and he allowed us to pass.
There was a narrow passage without any light, and through another door, at
which was likewise a sentinel, who turned the glare of a lantern upon me and
my conductors.  Some short explanation was given to him likewise, during 
which
I heard the words His Highness, which was the title which Cromwell had 
lately
assumed.

     They pushed me through this doorway, closed it behind me, and left me
alone in the dark.

 Next Time: A Singular Interview, and the Consequences of Passion.




                             CHAPTER CCXIV. [sic]

                               [Chapter 231]

A SINGULAR INTERVIEW, AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF PASSION.


     Being perfectly ignorant of where I was, I thought the most prudent 
plan
was to stand stock still, for if I advanced it might be into danger, and my
retreat was evidently cut off.

     Moreover, those who brought me there must have some sort of intention,
and it was better for me to leave them to develope it than to take any steps
myself, which might be of a very hazardous nature.

     That I was adopting the best policy I was soon convinced, for a flash 
of
light suddenly came upon me, and I heard a gruff voice, say, --

     "Who goes there? come this way."

     I walked on, and passed through an open door way into a small 
apartment,
in the centre of which, standing by a common deal table on which his 
clenched
hand was resting, I found Oliver Cromwell himself.

     "So, sirrah," he said, "royalists and pestilent characters are to 
ravage
the land, are they so? anwser me."

     "I have no answer to make, your highness," said I.

     "God's mercy, no answer, when in your own house the Duke of Cleveland's
proscribed secretary lies concealed."

     I felt rather staggered, but was certain I had been betrayed by some 
one,
and Cromwell continued rapidly, without giving me time to speak.

     "The Lord is merciful, and so are we, but the malignant must be taken 
by
the beloved soldiers of the Commonwealth, and the gospel God-fearing men, 
who
always turn to the Lord, with short carbines, will accompany you.  The
malignant shall be taken from your house, by you, and the true God-fearing
dragoons shall linger in the shade behind.  You will take him to the river
side, where the Lord willing, there will be a boat with a small blue ensign,
on board of which you will place him, wishing him good speed."

     He paused, and looked fixedly upon me by the aid of the miserable light
that was in the apartment.

     "What then, your highness?" I said.

     "Then you will probably call upon us to-morrow for a considerable sum,
which will be due to you for this good service to the Commonwealth; yes, it
shall be profitable to fight the battles of the Lord."

     I must confess, I had expected a very different result from the
interview, which I had been greatly in fear would have resulted, in greatly
endangering my liberty.  Cromwell was a man not to be tampered with; I knew 
my
danger, and was not disposed to sacrifice myself for Master Latham.

     "Your highness shall be obeyed," I said.

     "Ay, verily," he replied, "and if we be not obeyed, we must make
ourselves felt with a strong arm of flesh.  What ho!  God-fearing Simkins, 
art
thon [sic] there?"

     "Yes, the Lord willing," said a dragoon, making his appearance at the
door.

     Cromwell merely made him a sign with his hand, and he laid hold of the
upper part of my arm, as though it had been in a vice, and led me out into 
the
passage again where the sentinels were posted.

     In the course of a few moments, I was duly in custody of my two guards
again, and we were proceeding at a very rapid pace towards my residence.

     It was not a very agreeable affair, view it in whatever light I might;
but as regarded Cromwell, I knew my jeopardy, and it would be perceived that 
I
had not hesitated a moment in obeying him.  Moreover, I considered, for I 
knew
he was generous, I should have a good round sum by the transaction, which
added to the fifty pounds I had received from the royalists, made the affair
appear to me in a pleasant enough light.  Indeed, I was revolving in my mind
as I went along, whether it would not be worth while, almost entirely to
attach myself to the protector.

     "If," I reasoned with myself, "I should do that, and still preserve
myself a character with the royalists, I should thrive."

     But it will be seen that an adverse circumstance put an end to all 
those
dreams.

     When we reached the door of my house, the first thing I saw was my son
wiping his brow, as if he had undergone some fatigue; he ran up to me, and
catching me by the arm, whispered to me.

     I was so angered at the moment, that heedless of what I did, and 
passion
getting the mastery over me, I with my clenched fist struck him to the 
earth.
His head fell upon one of the hard round stones with which the street was
paved, and he never spoke again.  I had murdered him.

            *               *                 *                *

     I don't know what happened immediately subsequent to this fearful deed;
all I can recollect is, that there was a great confusion and a flashing of
lights, and it appeared to me as if something had suddenly struck me down to
the earth with great force.

     When I did thoroughly awaken, I found myself lying upon a small couch,
but in a very large apartment dimly lighted, and where there were many such
couches ranged against the walls.  A miserable light just enabled me to see
about me a little, and some dim dusky-looking figures were creeping about 
the
place.

     It was a hospital that the protector had lately instituted in the 
Strand.

     I tried to speak, but could not; my tongue seemed glued to my mouth, 
and
I could not, and then a change came upon my sense of sight, and I could
scarely see at all the dim dusky-looking figures about me.

     Some one took hold of me by the wrist, and I heard one say, quite
distinctly, --

     "He's entirely going, now."

     Suddenly it seemed as if something had fallen with a crushing influence
upon my chest, and then a consciousness that I was gasping for breath, and
then I thought I was at the bottom of the sea.  There was a moment, only a
moment, of frightful agony, and then came a singing sound, like the rush of
waters, after which, I distinctly felt some one raising me in their arms.  I
was dropped again, my limbs felt numbed and chill, an universal spasm shot
through my whole system, I opened my eyes, and found myself lying in the 
open
air, by a newly opened grave.

     A full moon was sailing through the sky and the cold beams were upon my
face; a voice sounded in my ears, a deep and solmen voice-- and painfully
distinct was every word it uttered.

     "Mortimer," it said, for that was my name, "Mortimer, in life you did 
one
deed which at once cast you out from all hope that anything in that life 
would
be remembered in the world to come to your advantage.  You poisoned the pure
font of mercy, and not upon such as you can the downy freshness of Heaven's
bounty fall.  Murderer, murderer of that being sacredly presented to your 
care
by the great Creator of all things, live henceforth a being accursed.  Be to
yourself a desolation and a blight, shunned by all that is good and 
virtuous,
armed against all men, and all men armed against thee, Varney the Vampyre."

              *               *                 *                *

     I staggered to my feet, the scene around me was a churchyard, I was 
gaunt
and thin, my clothes hung about me in tattered remnants.  The damp smell of
the grave hung about them, I met an aged man, and asked him where I was.  He
looked at me with a shudder, as though I had escaped from some charnel 
house.

     "Why this is Isledon," said he.

     A peal of bells came merrily upon the night air.

     "What means that?" said I.

     "Why this is the anniversary of the Restoration."

     "The Restoration!  What Restoration?"

     "Why of the royal family to the throne, to be sure, returned this day
last year.  Have you been asleep so long that you don't know that?"

     I shuddered and walked on, determined to make further inquiries, and to
make them with so much caution, that the real extent of my ignorance should
scarce be surmised, and the result was to me of the most astonishing
character.

     I found that I had been in the trance of death for nearly two years, 
and
that during that period, great political changes had taken place.  The 
exiled
royal family had been restored to the throne, and the most remarkable
revulsion of feeling that had ever taken place in a nation had taken place 
in
England.

     But personally I had not yet fully awakened to all the horror of what I
was.  I had heard the words addressed to me, but I had attached no very
definite meaning to them."

 Next Time: Varney's Narative Continued.




                             CHAPTER CCXV. [sic]

                               [Chapter 232]

VARNEY'S NARATIVE CONTINUED.


     Mr. Bevan paused when he had got thus far, to ask himself if he ought 
to
give credence to what he read, or put it down as the raving of some person,
whose wits had become tangled and deranged by misfortune.

     Had the manuscript come to him without other circumstances to give it 
the
air of truthfulness, he would have read it only as a literary curiosity, but
it will be remembered that he had been a spectator of the resuscitation of
Clara Crofton, which afforded of itself a very frightful verification of
Varney's story -- a story so horrible in all its details, that but for the
great interest which it really possessed, he would have deeply regretted the
mixing it up in his memory with brighter subjects.

     There was something yet to read in the papers before him, and thinking
that it was better to know all at once than to leave his imagination to work
upon matters so likely seriously to affect it, he resumed his perusal of 
these
papers, which might be considered the autobiography of Varney.

            *               *                 *                *

     I have already said that I was not yet fully alive to the horror of 
what
I was, but I soon found what the words which had been spoken to me by the
mysterious being who had exhumed me meant; I was a thing accursed, a 
something
to be shunned by all men, a horror, a blight, and a desolation.

     I felt myself growing sick and weak, as I traversed the streets of the
city, and yet I loathed the sight of food, whenever I saw it.

     I reached my own house, and saw that it had been burned down; there lay
nothing but a heap of charred ruins where it once stood.

     But I had an interest in those ruins, for from time to time I had 
buried
considerable sums of money beneath the flooring of the lowest apartments, 
and
I had every reason to believe, as such a secret treasure was only known to
myself, that it remained untouched.

     I waited until the moon became obscured by some passing clouds, and 
then
having a most intimate knowledge of the locality, I commenced groping about
the ruins, and removing a portion of them, until I made my way to the spot
where my money was hidden.

     The morning came, however, and surprised me at my occupation; so I hid
myself among the ruins of what had once been my home for a whole day, and
never once stirred from my concealment.

     Oh, it was a long and weary day.  I could hear the prattle of children 
at
play, an inn or change-house was near at hand, and I could hear noisy 
drinkers
bawling forth songs that had been proscribed in the Commonwealth.

     I saw a poor wretch hunted nearly to death, close to where I lay
concealed, because from the fashion of his garments, and the cut of his 
hair,
he was supposed to belong to the deposed party.

     But the long expected night came at last.  It was a dark one, too, so
that it answered my purpose well.

     I had found an old rusty knife among the ruins, and with that I set to
work to dig up my hidden treasure; I was successful, and found it all.  Not 
a
guinea had been removed, although in the immediate neighbourhood, there were
those who would have sacrificed a human life for any piece of gold that I 
had
hoarded.

     I made no enquiries about any one that had belonged to me.  I dreaded 
to
receive some horrible and circumstantial answer, but I did get a slight 
piece
of news, as I left the ruins, although I asked not for it.

     "There's a poor devil," said one; "did you ever see such a wretch in 
all
your life?"

     "Why, yes," said another, "he's enough to turn one's canary sour, he
seems to have come up from the ruins of Mortimers's house.  By-the-by did 
you
ever hear what became of him?"

     "Yes, to be sure, he was shot by two of Cromwell's dragoons in some
fracas or another."

     "Ah, I recollect now, I heard as much.  He murdered his son, didn't 
he?"

     I passed on.  Those words seemed to send a bolt of fire through the
brain, and I dreaded that the speaker might expatiate upon them.

     A slow misty rain was falling, which caused the streets to be very much
deserted, but being extremely well acquainted with the city, I passed on 
till
I came to that quarter which was principally inhabited by Jews, who I knew
would take my money without any troublesome questions being asked me, and 
also
I could procure every accomodation required; and they did do so, for before
another hour had passed over my head, I emerged richly habited as a 
chevalier
of the period, having really not paid to the conscientious Israelite much 
more
than four times the price of the clothing I walked away with.

     And thus I was in the middle of London, with some hundreds of pounds in
my pocket, and a horrible uncertainty as to what I was.

     I was growing fainter and fainter still, and I feared that unless I
succeeded in housing myself shortly, I should become a prey to some one who,
seeing my exhausted condition, would, notwithstanding I had a formidable
rapier by my side, rob me of all I possessed.

     My career has been much too long and too chequered an one even to give
the briefest sketch of.  All I purpose here to relate is how I became
convinced I was a vampyre, and that blood was my congenial nourishment and 
the
only element of my new existence.

     I passed on until I came to a street where I knew the houses were large
but unfashionable, and that they were principally occupied by persons who 
made
a trade by letting out apartments, and there I thought I might locate myself
in safety.

     As I made no difficulty about terms, there was no difficulty at all of
any sort, and I found myself conducted into a tolerably handsome suite of
rooms in the house of a decent-looking widow woman, who had two daughters,
young and blooming girls, both of whom regarded me as the new lodger, with
looks of anything but favour, considering my awful and cadaverous appearance
most probably as promising nothing at all in the shape of pleasant
companionship.

     This I was quite prepared for-- I had seen myself in a mirror-- that 
was
enough; and I could honestly have averred that a more ghastly and horrible
looking skeleton, attired in silks and broad-cloth, never yet walked the
streets of the city.

     When I retired to my chamber, I was so faint and ill, that I could
scarcely drag one foot after the other; and was ruminating what I should do,
until a strange feeling crept over me that I should like---- what?  Blood! -
-
raw blood, reeking and hot, bubbling and juicy, from the veins of some 
gasping
victim.

     A clock upon the stairs struck one.  I arose and listened attentively;
all was still in the house-- still as the very grave.

     It was a large old rambling building, and had belonged at one time, no
doubt, to a man of some mark and likelihood in the world.  My chamber was 
one
of six that opened from a corridor of a considerable length, and which
traversed the whole length of the house.

     I crept out into this corridor, and listened again for full ten 
minutes,
but not the slightest sound, save my own faint breathing, disturbed the
stillness of the house; and that emboldened me so that, with my appetite for
blood growing each moment stronger, I began to ask myself from whose veins I
could seek strength and nourishment.

     But how was I to proceed?  How was I to know in that large house which 
of
the sleepers I could attack with safety, for it had now come to that, that I
was to attack somebody.  I stood like an evil spirit, pondering over the 
best
means of securing a victim.

     And there came over me the horrible faintness again, that faintness 
which
each moment grew worse, and which threatened completely to engulf me.  I
feared that some flush of it would overtake me, and then I should fall to 
rise
no more; and strange as it may appear, I felt a disposition to cling to the
new life that had been given to me.  I seemed to be acquainted already with
all its horrors, but not all its joys.

     Suddenly the darkness of the corridor was cleared away, and soft and
mellow light crept into it, and I said to myself, --

     "The moon has risen."

     Yes, the bright and beautiful moon, which I had felt the soft influence
of when I lay among the graves, had emerged from the bank of clouds along 
the
eastern sky, its beams descending through a little window.  They streamed
right through the corridor, faintly but effectually illuminating it, and
letting me see clearly all the different doors leading to the different
chambers.

     And thus it was that I had light for anything I wished to do, but not
information.

     The moonbeams playing upon my face seemed to give me a spurious sort of
strength.  I did not know until after experience what a marked and sensible
effect they would always have upon me, but I felt it even then, although I 
did
not attribute it wholly to the influence of the queenly planet.

     I walked on through the corridor, and some sudden influence seemed to
guide me to a particular door.  I know not how it was, but I laid my hand 
upon
the lock, and said to myself, --

     "I shall find my victim here."

                                    -+-

 Next Time: The Night Attack. -- The Horrible Conclusion.




                             CHAPTER CCXVI. [sic]

                               [Chapter 233]

THE NIGHT ATTACK. -- THE HORRIBLE CONCLUSION.


     I paused yet a moment, for there came across me even then, after I had
gone so far, a horrible dread of what I was about to do, and a feeling that
there might be consequences arising from it that would jeopardise me 
greatly.
Perhaps even then if a great accession of strength had come to my aid-- mere
bodily aid I mean-- I should have hesitated, and the victim would have
escaped; but, as if to mock me, there came that frightful feeling of
exhaustion which felt so like the prelude to another death.

     I no longer hesitated; I turned the lock of the door, and I thought 
that
I must be discovered.  I left it open about an inch, and then flew back to 
my
own chamber.

     I listened attentively; there was no alarm, no movement in any of the
rooms-- the same death-like stillness pervaded the house, and I felt that I
was still safe.

     A soft gleam of yellow looking light had come through the crevice of 
the
door when I had opened it.  It mingled strangely with the moonlight, and I
concluded correctly enough, as I found afterwards, that a light was burning 
in
the chamber.

     It was at least another ten minutes before I could sufficiently re-
assure
myself to glide from my own room and approach that of the fated sleeper; but
at length I told myself that I might safely do so, and the night was waning
fast, and if anything was to be accomplished it must be done at once, before
the first beams of early dawn should chase away the spirits of the night, 
and
perhaps should leave me no power to act.

     "What shall I be," I asked myself; "after another four-and-twenty hours
of exhaustion?  Shall I have power then to make the election of what I will 
do
or what I will not?  No, I may suffer the pangs of death again, and the
scarcely less pangs of another revival."

     This reasoning-- if it may be called reasoning-- decided me; and with
cautious and cat-like footsteps, I again approached the bed-room door which 
I
had opened.

     I no longer hesitated, but at once crossed the threshold, and looked
around me.  It was the chamber of the youngest of my landlady's daughters,
who, as far as I could judge, seemed to be about sixteen years of age; but
they had evidently been so struck with my horrible appearance, that they had
placed themselves as little as possible in my way, so that I could not be 
said
to be a very good judge of their ages or of their looks.

     I only knew she was the youngest, because she wore her hair long, and
wore it in ringlets, which were loose and streaming over the pillow on which
she slept, while her sister, I remarked, wore her hair plaited up, and
completely off her neck and shoulders.

     I stood by the bed-side, and looked upon this beautiful girl in all the
pride of her young beauty, so gently and quietly slumbering.  Her lips were
parted, as though some pleasant images were passing in her mind, and induced 
a
slight smile even in her sleep.  She murmured twice, too, a word, which I
thought was the name of some one-- perchance the idol of her young heart-- 
but
it was too indistinct for me to catch it, nor did I care to hear; that which
was perhaps a very cherished secret, indeed, mattered not to me.  I made no
pretentions to her affections, however strongly in a short time I might 
stand
in her abhorrence.

     One of her arms, which was exquisitely rounded, lay upon the coverlit; 
a
neck, too, as white as alabaster, was partially exposed to my gaze, but I 
had
no passions-- it was food I wanted.

     I sprung upon her.  There was a shriek, but not before I had secured a
draught of life blood from her neck.  It was enough.  I felt it dart through
my veins like fire, and I was restored.  From that moment I found out what 
was
to be my sustenance; it was blood-- the blood of the young and the 
beautiful.

     The house was thoroughly alarmed, but not before I had retired to my 
own
chamber.  I was but partially dressed, and those few clothes I threw off me,
and getting into my bed, I feigned to be asleep; so that when a gentleman 
who
slept likewise in the house, but of whose presence I knew nothing, knocked
hardly at my door, I affected to awaken in a fright, and called out, --

     "What is it? what is it? -- fof God's sake tell me if it is a fire."

     "No, no-- but get up, sir, get up.  There's some one in the place.  An
attempt at murder, I think, sir."

     I arose and opened the door; so by the right [sic] he carried he saw 
that
I had to dress myself-- he was but half attired himself, and he carried his
sword beneath his arm.

     "It is a strange thing," he said; "but I have heard a shriek of alarm."

     "And I likewise," said I; "but I thought it was a dream."

     "Help! help! help!" cried the widow, who had risen, but stood upon the
threshold of her own chamber; "thieves! thieves!"

     By this time I had got on sufficient of my apparel that I could make an
appearance, and, likewise with my sword in my hand, I sallied out into the
corridor.

     "Oh, gentlemen-- gentlemen," cried the landlady, "did you hear 
anything?"

     "A shriek, madam," said my fellow-lodger; "have you looked into your
daughters' chambers?"

     The room of the youngest daughter was the nearest, and into that she 
went
at once.  In another moment she appeared on the threshold again with a face 
as
white as a sheet, then she wrung her hands, and said, --

     "Murder! murder! -- my child is murdered-- my child is murdered, Master
Harding," -- which I found was the name of my fellow-lodger.

     "Fling open one of the windows, and call for the watch," said he to me.
"and I will search the room, and woe be to any one that I may find within 
its
walls unauthorised."

     I did as he desired, and called the watch, but the watch came not, and
then, upon a second visit to her daughter, the landlady found she had only
fainted, and that she had been deceived in thinking she was murdered by the
sudden sight of the blood upon her neck, so the house was restored to
something like quiet again, and the morning begin now near at hand, Mr.
Harding retired to his chamber, and I to mine, leaving the landlady and her
eldest daughter assiduous in their attentions to the younger.

     How wonderfuly revived I felt-- I was quite a new creature when the
sunlight came dancing into my apartment.  I dressed and was about to leave 
the
house, when Mr. Harding came out of one of the lower rooms, and intercepted
me.

     "Sir," he said, "I have not the pleasure of knowing you, but I have no
doubt that an ordinary feeling of chivalry will prompt you to do all in your
power to obviate the dread of such another night as the past."

     "Dread, sir," said I, "the dread of what?"

     "A very proper question," he said, "but one I can hardly answer; the 
girl
states, she was awakened by some one biting her neck, and in proof of the
story she actually exhibits the marks of teeth, and so terrified is she, 
that
she declares that she shall never be able to sleep again."

     "You astonish me."

     "No doubt-- it is sufficiently astonishing to excuse even doubts; but 
if
you and I, who are both inmates of the house, were to keep watch to-night in
the corridor, it might have the effect of completely quieting the 
imagination
of the young girl, and perhaps result in the discovery of this nocturnal
disturber of the peace."

     "Certainly," said I, "command me in any way, I shall have great
pleasure."

     "Shall it be understood, then, that we meet at eleven in your apartment
or in mine."

     "Whichever you may please to consider the most convenient, sir."

     "I mention my own then, which is the furthest door in the corridor, and
where I shall be happy to see you at eleven o'clock."

     There was a something about this young man's manner which I did not
altogether like, and yet I could not come to any positive conclusion as to
whether he suspected me, and therefore I thought it would be premature to 
fly,
when perhaps there would be really no occasion for doing so; on the 
contrary,
I made up my mind to wait the result of the evening, which might or might 
not
be disastrous to me.  At all events, I considered that I was fully equal to
taking my own part, and if by the decrees of destiny I was really to be, as 
it
were, repudiated from society, and made to endure a new, strange, and 
horrible
existence, I did not see that I was called upon to be particular how I 
rescued
myself from difficulties that might arise.

     Relying, then, upon my own strength, and my own unscrupulous use of it, 
I
awaited with tolerable composure the coming of night.

     During the day I amused myself by walking about, and noting the
remarkable changes which so short a period as two years had made in London.
But these happened to be two years most abundantly prolific in change.  The
feelings and habits of people seemed to have undergone a thorough 
revolution,
which I was the more surprised at when I learned by what thorough treachery
the restoration of the exiled family was effected.

     The day wore on; I felt no need of refreshment, and I began to feel my
own proper position, and to feel that occasionally a draught of delicious
life-blood, such as I had quaffed the night before was fresh marrow to my
bones.

     I could see, when I entered the house where I had made my temporary 
home,
that notwithstanding that I considered my appearance wonderfully improved,
that feeling was not shared in by others, for the whole family shrunk from 
me
as though there had been a most frightful contamination in my touch, and as
though the very air I had breathed was hateful and deleterious.  I felt
convinced that there had been some conversation concerning me, and that I 
was
rather more than suspected.  I certainly could then have left the place 
easily
and quietly, but I had a feeling of defiance, which did not enable me to do
so.

     I felt as if I were an injured being, and ought to resist a something
that looked like oppression.

     "Why," I said to myself, "have I been rescued from the tomb to be made
the sport of a malignant destiny?  My crime was a great one, but surely I
suffered enough, when I suffered death as an expiation of it, and I might 
have
been left to repose in the grave."

     The feelings that have since come over me held no place in my
imagination, but with a kind of defiant desperation I felt as if I should 
like
to defeat the plan by which I was attempted to be punished, and even in the
face of Providence itself, to show that it was a failure entailing far worse
consequences upon others than upon me.

     This was my impression, so I would not play the coward, and fly upon 
the
first flash of danger.

     I sat in my own room until the hour came for my appointment with Mr.
Harding, and then I walked along the corridor with a confident step, and let
the hilt end of my scabbard clank along the floor.  I knocked boldly at the
door, and I thought there was a little hesitation in his voice as he bade me
walk in, but this might have been only my imagination.

     He was seated at a table, fully dressed, and in addition to his sword,
there was lying upon the table before him a large holster pistol, nearly 
half
the size of a carbine.

     "You are well prepared," said I, as I pointed to it.

     "Yes," he said, "and I mean to use it."

     "What do they want now?" I said.

     "What do who want?"

     "I don't know," I said, "but I thought I heard some one call you by 
name
from below."

     "Indeed, excuse me a moment, perhaps they have made some discovery."

     There was wine upon the table, and while he was gone, I poured a glass 
of
good Rhenish down the barrel of the pistol.  I wiped it carefully with the
cuff of my coat, so there was no appearance upon the barrel of anything of 
the
sort, and when he came back, he looked at me very suspiciously, as he said, 
--

     "Nobody called me, how could you say I was called."

     "Because I thought I heard you called; I suppose it is allowable for
human nature to be fallible now and then."

     "Yes, but then I am so surprised how you could make such a mistake."

     "So am I."

     It was rather a difficult thing to answer this, and looking at me very
steadily, he took up the pistol and examined the priming.  Of course, that 
was
all right, and he appeared to be perfectly satisfied.

     "There will be two chairs and a table," he said, "placed in the 
corridor,
so that we can sit in perfect ease.  I will not anticipate that anything 
will
happen, but if it should, I can only say that I will not be backward in the
use of my weapons."

     "I don't doubt it," said I, "and commend you accordingly.  That pistol
must be a most formidable weapon.  Does it ever miss fire?"

     "Not that I know of," he said, "I have loaded it with such 
extraordinary
care that it amounts to almost an impossibility that it should.  Will you 
take
some wine?"

     At this moment there came a loud knocking at the door of the house.  I
saw an expression of satisfaction come over his face and he sprung to his
feet, holding the pistol in his grasp.

     "Do you know the meaning of that knocking," said I, "at such an hour?"
and at the same time with a sweep of my arm I threw his sword off the table
and beyond his reach.

     "Yes," he said, rather excitedly; "you are my prisoner, it was you who
caused the mischief and confusion last night.  The girl is ready to swear to
you, and if you attempt to escape, I'll blow your brains out."

     "Fire at me," said I, "and take the consequences-- but the threat is
sufficient, and you shall die for your temerity."

     I drew my sword, and he evidently thought his danger imminent, for he 
at
once snapped the pistol in my face.  Of course it only flashed in the pan, 
but
in one moment my sword went through him like a flash of light.  It was a 
good
blade the Jew had sold me-- the hilt struck against his breast bone, and he
shrieked.

     Bang! bang! bang! came again at the outer door of the house.  I 
withdrew
the reeking blade, dashed it into the scabbard just in time to prevent my
landlady from opening the door, which she was almost in the act of doing.  I
seized her by the back of the neck, and hurled her to a considerable 
distance,
and then opening the door myself, I stood behind it, and let three men rush
into the house.  After which I quietly left it, and was free." [sic]

 Next Time: Varney Details His Second Death.




                             CHAPTER CCXVII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 234]

VARNEY DETAILS HIS SECOND DEATH.


     The clergyman was perfectly amazed, as well he might be, at these
revelations of the vampyre.  He looked up from the manuscript that Varney 
had
left him, with a far more bewildered look than he had ever worn when 
studying
the most abstruse sciences or difficult languages.

     "Can I," he said, -- "ought I to believe it?"

     This was a question more easily asked than answered, and after pacing 
the
little room for a time, he thought he had better finish the papers of the
vampyre, before he tortured his mind with any more suppositions upon the
subject.

     The papers continued thus, and the clergyman was soon completely 
absorbed
in the great interest of the strange recital they contained.

            *               *                 *                *

     I cared nothing as regarded my last adventure, so that it had one
termination which was of any importance to me, namely, that termination 
which
insured my safety.  When I got into the street, I walked hurriedly on, never
once looking behind me, until I was far enough off, and I felt assured all
pursuit was out of the question.

     I then began to bethink me what I had next to do.

     I was much revived by the draught of blood I had already had, but as 
yet
I was sufficiently new to my vampyre-like existence not to know how long 
such
a renewal of my life and strength would last me.

     I certainly felt vigorous, but it was a strange, unearthly sort of
vigour, having no sort of resemblance whatever to the strength which persons
in an ordinary state of existence may be supposed to feel, when the 
faculties
are all full of life, and acting together harmoniously and well.

     When I paused, I found myself in Pall Mall, and not far off from the
palace of St. James, which of late had seen so many changes, and been the
witness of such remarkable mutations in the affair of monarchs, that its 
real
chronicles would even then have afforded an instructive volume.

     I wandered right up to the gates of the royal pile, but then as I was
about to enter the quadrangle called the colour court, I was rudely repulsed
by a sentinel.

     It was not so in the time of Cromwell, but at the same moment I had 
quite
forgotten all that was so completely changed.

     I always bow to authority when I cannot help it, so I turned aside at
once, without making any remark; but as I did so I saw a small door open, 
not
far from where I was, and two figures emerged muffled up in brown cloaks.

     They looked nothing peculiar at the first glance, but when you came to
examine the form and features, and to observe the manners of those two men,
you could not but come to a conclusion that they were what the world would
estimate as something great.

     Adventure to me was life itself, now that I had so strangely shuffled 
off
all other ties that bound me to the world, and I had a reckless disregard of
danger, which arose naturally enough from my most singular and horrible 
tenure
of existence.  I resolved to follow these two men closely enough, and yet, 
if
possible, without exciting their observation.

     "Shall we have any sport?" said one.

     "I trust that the ladies," replied the other, "will afford us some."

     "And yet they were rather coy, do you not think, on the last meeting,
Rochester?"

     "Your majesty----"

     "Hush, man-- hush! why are you so imprudent as to majesty me in the
public streets.  Here would be a court scandal if any eaves-dropper had 
heard
you.  You were wont to be much more careful than that."

     "I spoke," said the other, "to recal [sic] your majesty to care.  The
name of Rochester, which you pronounced, is just as likely in the streets at
such a time to create court scandal as that of---"

     "Hush, hush!  Did I say Rochester?  Well-- well, man, hold your peace 
if
I did, and come on quickly-- if we can but persuade them to come out, we can
take them into the garden of the palace; I have the key of that most handy
little door in the wall, which has served us more than once."

     Of course, after this, I had no difficulty in knowing that the one
speaker was the restored monarch, Charles the Second, and the other was his
favourite, and dissolute companion, Rochester, of whom I had heard 
something,
although I had been far too short a time in the land of the living again, to
have had any opportunity of seeing either of them before, but since they had
now confessed themselves to be what they were, I could have no sort of
difficulty in their recognition at any other time.

     I had carefully kept out of sight while the little dialogue I have just
recorded took place, so that although they more than once glanced around 
them
suspiciously and keenly, they saw me not, and having quite satisfied them 
that
their imprudent speech had done them no harm, they walked on hurriedly in 
the
direction of Pimlico.

     Little did Charles and his companion guess how horrible a being was
following close upon their track.  If they had done so they might have 
paused,
aghast, and pursued another course to that which was occupying their 
attention
I had a difficult part to play in following them, for although the king was
incautious enough to have been safely and easily followed by any one,
Rochester was not, but kept a wary eye around him, so that I was really more
than once upon the point of being detected, and yet by dint of good 
management
I did escape.

     Pimlico at that time was rather a miserable neighbourhood, and far, 
very
far indeed from being what it is now, but both the king and Rochester 
appeared
to be well acquainted with it and they went on for a considerable distance
until they came to a turning of a narrow dismal-looking character bounded 
on,
each side not by houses but by the garden walls of houses, and to judge from
the solidity and the  height of those walls, the houses should have been
houses of some importance.

     "Bravo, bravissimo!" said the king, "we are thus far into the enemy
territory without observation."

     "So it seems," replied Rochester; "and now think you we can find the
particular wall again."

     "Of a surety, yes.  Did I not ask them to hang out a handkerchief or 
some
other signal, by which we might be this night guided in our search, and 
there
it flutters."

     The king pointed to the top of the wall, where a handkerchief waved and
something certainly in the shape of a human head appeared against the night
sky, and as sweet a voice as ever I heard in my life, said, --

     "Gentlemen, I pray you to go away."

     "What," said the king; "go away just as the sun has risen?"

     "Nay, but gentlemen," said the voice, "we are afraid we are watched."

     "We!" said Rochester, "you say we, and yet your fair companion is not
visible."

     "Fair sir," said the lady, "it is not the easiet task in the world for
one of us to stand upon a ladder.  It certainly will not hold two."

     "Fair lady," said the king, "and if you can but manage to come over the
wall, we will all four take one of the pleasantest strolls in the world; a
friend of mine, who is a captain in the Royal Guard, will at my request, 
allow
us to walk in the private garden of St. James's palace."

     "Indeed."

     "Yes, fair one.  That garden of which you may have heard as the 
favourite
resort of the gay Charles."

     "But we are afraid," said the lady; "our uncle may come home.  It's 
very
improper indeed-- very indiscret-- [sic] we ought not to think of such a 
thing
for a moment.  In fact, it's decidedly wrong gentlemen, but how are we to 
get
over the wall?"

     The party all laughed out together.

 Next Time: The Palace Garden in St. James's.




                            CHAPTER CCXVIII. [sic]

                               [Chapter 235]

THE PALACE GARDEN IN ST. JAMES'S.


     It was certainly a very ingenious speech which the lady on the wall had
given utterance to, and sufficiently exemplified how inclination was
struggling with prudence.  It was just the sort of speech which suited those
to whom it was addressed.

     After the laughter had subsided a little Charles spoke, --

     "By the help of the ladder we have," he said, "you can easily leave 
where
you are, and as easily return, but I perceive you lack the strength to lift 
it
over this side so as to descend."

     "Just so, "said the lady, in a low voice.

     "Well, I think that by the aid of my friend Smith here, I can get up to
the top of the wall, and assist you."

     Charles, by the aid of Rochester, contrived to scramble to the top of 
the
wall, to the assistance of the two damsels who were so fearful, and yet so
willing, to risk a little danger to their reputations, for the purpose of
enjoying a walk in the king's garden at St. James's.

     The idea came across me of doing some mischief, but I did not just then
interfere as I wanted to see the result of the affair.  The ladder was duly
pulled over by the monarch after both the ladies had got on the top of the
wall, and while Rochester steadied it below they descended in perfect 
safety,
and the party walked hastily from the place in the direction of St. James's.

     I followed them with great caution, after having removed the ladder to
the all of a garden several doors from the proper one.  They went on talking
and laughing in the gayest possible manner, until they reached Buckingham
house, and then they took a secluded path that led them close to the gardens
of St. James's.

     Some overhanging trees shed such an impervious shadow upon all objects
that I found I might as well be quite near to the party as far off, so I
apporached boldly and heard that the ladies were beginning to get a little
alarmed at this secret and strictly private mode of entrance to the garden.

     "Gentlemen," said one, "don't go into the garden if you have no proper
leave to do so."

     "Oh, but we have," said the king.  "Lately I have had proper leave I
assure you; it did happen that for some time the leave was taken away, but I
have it again along with a few other little privileges that I wanted much."

     "You need fear nothing," said Rochester.

     They all four stood in a group by the little door, while the king 
fumbled
about with a key for some few minutes, before he could open the lock.  At
length, however, he succeeded in doing so, and the door swung open.  The 
king
dropped the key and was unable to find it again; so leaving the door as 
close
as they could, the party passed onwards, and I soon followed in their
footsteps.

     The place was profoundly dark.

     I could feel the soft grating of fine gravel under my feet, and feeling
that such a sand might betray me, I stepped aside until I trod upon a 
border,
as I found it to be, of velvet turf.  The odour of sweet flowers came upon 
my
senses, and occasionally as the night wind swept among the trees, there 
would
be a pleasant murmuring sound quite musical in its effect.

     The soft soil effectually prevented my footsteps from being heard, and 
I
soon stood quite close to the parties, and found that they were at the
entrance of a little gaudy pavilion, from a small painted window in which
streamed a light.

     The ladies seemed to be rather in a flutter of apprehension, and yet 
the
whole affair no doubt to them presented itself in the shape of such a 
charming
and romantic adventure, that I very much doubt if they would have gone back
now, had they had all the opportunity in the world so to do.

     Finally they all went into the pavillion.  I then advanced, and finding 
a
window, that commanded a good view of the interior I looked in and was much
amused at what passed.

     The place was decorated in a tasteful manner, although a little
approaching to the gaudy, and the pictures painted in fresco upon the walls
were not precisely what the strictest prudery would have considered correct,
while at the same time there was nothing positively offensive in them.

     A table stood in the centre, and was covered with rich confectionery, 
and
wine, while the lamp that had sent the stream of light through the painted
window was dependent from the ceiling by three massive gilt chains.

     Take it for all in all, it certainly was a handsome place.

     The king and Rochester were urging the ladies to drink wine, and now 
that
for the first time I had an opportunity of seeing the countenances of the
different persons whom I had followed so far, I confess that I looked upon
them with much curiosity.  The ladies were decidely handsome, and the 
youngest
who had fallen to the lot of the king was very pretty indeed, and had a look
of great innocence and sweetness upon her face.  I pitied her.

     The king was a small, dark, sharp-featured man, and I thought that 
there
was an obliquity in his vision.  As for Rochester, he was decidedly ugly.  
His
face was rather flat, and of a universal dirty looking white colour.  He
certainly was not calculated to win a lady's favour.  But then for all I 
knew,
he might have a tongue to win an angel out of heaven.

     Such a capacity goes much further with a woman who has any mind than 
all
the physical graces, and women of no mind are not worth the winning.

 Next Time: An Adventure. - The Carbine Shot. - The Death.

AN ADVENTURE. - THE CARBINE SHOT. - THE DEATH.


     "Nay," I heard the king say, "they ought, and no doubt do, keep choice
wine here; drink, fair one."

     The young girl shook her head.

     "Nay, now," said Charles with a laugh, as he finished off himself the
glass that the young girl took so small a sip of, "I will convince you that 
I
think it good."

     The lady with whom Rochester was conversing in a low tone, had no such
scruples, for she tossed off a couple of glasses as fast as they were 
tendered
to her, and talked quite at her ease, admiring the pavilion, the pictures, 
the
hangings and furniture, and wondering whether the king ever came there
himself.

     Rochester began mystifying her, talking to her in a low tone, while I
turned my attention to the king, and the younger, and certainly more 
estimable
female of the two.

     The king had been talking to her in a low tone, when she suddenly 
started
to her feet, her face flushed with anger and alarm.

     "Louisa," she said, "I claim your protection; you were left in care of
me.  Take me home, or I will tell my uncle how you basely betrayed your 
trust,
by pursuading me there was no harm in meeting those gentlemen."

     "Pho! he [sic] child's mad," said Louisa.

     "Quite mad," said the king, as he advanced towards her again; she fled 
to
the door of the pavilion.  I knew not what impluse it was that urged me on,
but I left the window hastily, and met her, she fell into my arms, and the
light fell strongly upon me as I confronted the king.

     "The guard.  The guard," he shouted.

     "Louisa pretended to faint, and the ngyon grl [young girl] clung to me 
as
her only protector, exclaiming, --

     "Save me! save me; Oh save me!"

     The garden door is open," I whispered to her, "follow me quickly, not a
moment is to be lost."  We both fled together.

     I was about to pass through the doorway, when a shot from one of the
guards struck me, and I fell to the ground as if the hand of a giant had
struck me down.  There was a rush of blood from my heart to my head, a 
burning
sensation of pain for a moment or two, that was most horrible, and then a 
sea
of yellow light seemed to be all around me.

     I remembered no more.

     It was afterwards that I found this was my second death, and that the
favourite, Rochester, had actually directed that I should be shot rather 
than
permitted to escape, for he dreaded more than the monarch did the exposure 
of
his vices.  I do not think that Charles, in like manner, had he been at 
hand,
would have had my life taken, although it is hard to say what kings will do 
or
what they will not when they are thwarted.

 Next Time: The Total Destruction of Varney the Vampyre, and Conclusion.




                             CHAPTER CCXX. [sic]

                               [Chapter 237]

THE TOTAL DESTRUCTION OF VARNEY THE VAMPYRE, AND CONCLUSION.


     The manuscript which the clergyman had read with so much interest, here
abruptly terminated.  He was left to conclude that Varney after that had 
been
resuscitated; and he was more perplexed than ever to come to any opinion
concerning the truth of the narration which he had now concluded.

     It was one week after he had finished the perusal of Varney's papers 
that
the clergyman read in an English newspaper the following statement.

     "We extract from the _Algemeine Zeitung_ the following most curious
story, the accuracy of which of course we cannot vouch for, but still there 
is
a sufficient air of probability about it to induce us to present it to our
readers.

     "Late in the evening, about four days since, a tall and melancholy-
looking stranger arrived, and put up at one of the principal hotels at 
Naples.
He was a most peculiar looking man, and considered by the persons of the
establishment as about the ugliest guest they had ever had within the walls 
of
their place.

     "In a short time he summoned the landlord, and the following 
conversation
ensued between him and the strange guest.

     "'I want,' said the stranger, 'to see all the curiosities of Naples, 
and
among the rest Mount Vesuvius.  Is there any difficulty?[']

     "'None,' replied the landlord, 'with a proper guide.[']

     "A guide was soon secured, who set out with the adventurous Englishman 
to
make the ascent of the burning mountain.

     "They went on then until the guide did not think it quite prudent to go
any further, as there was a great fissure in the side of the mountain, out 
of
which a stream of lava was slowly issuing and speading [sic] itself in 
rather
an alarming manner.

     "The ugly Englishman, however, pointed to a secure mode of getting 
higher
still, and they proceeded until they were very near the edge of the crater
itself.  The stranger then took his purse from his pocket and flung it to 
the
guide saying, --

     "'You can keep that for your pains, and for coming into some danger 
with
me.  But the fact was, that I wanted a witness to an act which I have set my
mind upon performing.'

     "The guide says that these words were spoken with so much calmness, 
that
he verily believed the act mentioned as about to be done was some scientific
experiment of which he knew that the English were very fond, and he replied,
--

     "'Sir, I am only too proud to serve so generous and so distinguished a
gentleman.  In what way can I be useful?'

     "'You will make what haste you can,['] said the stranger, [']from the
mountain, inasmuch as it is covered with sulphurous vapours, inimical to 
human
life, and when you reach the city you will cause to be published an account 
of
my proceedings, and what I say.  You will say that you accompanied Varney 
the
Vampyre to the crater of Mount Vesuvius, and that, tired and disgusted with 
a
life of horror, he flung himself in to prevent the possibility of a
reanimation of his remains.'

     ["]Before then the guide could utter anything but a shriek, Varney took
one tremendous leap, and disappeared into the burning mouth of the
mountain.["]

                                  THE END
