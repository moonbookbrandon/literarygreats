THE FIRST PART 


THE FIRST PART TREATING OF THE THREE NECESSARY CONCOMITANTS OF WITCHCRAFT, 
WHICH ARE THE DEVIL, A WITCH, AND THE PERMISSION OF ALMIGHTY GOD 

Question I  Whether the Belief that there are such Beings as Witches is so 
Essential a Part of the Catholic Faith that Obstinacy to maintain the 
Opposite Opinion manifestly savours of Heresy.  

Question II  If it be in Accordance with the Catholic Faith to maintain that 
in Order to bring about some Effect of Magic, the Devil must intimately co-
operate with the Witch, or whether one without the other, that is to say, 
the Devil without the Witch, or conversely, could produce such an Effect.  

Question III  Whether Children can be Generated by Incubi and Succubi.  

Question IV  By which Devils are the Operations of Incubus and Succubus 
Practised?  

Question V  What is the Source of the Increase of Works of Witchcraft? 
Whence comes it that the Practice of Witchcraft hath so notably increased?

Origins the Works of Witches are justly suffered to take place.  

Solutions of the Arguments.

Question XIV  The Enormity of Witches is Considered, and it is shown that 
the Whole Matter should be rightly Set Forth and Declared.  

Question XV  It is Shown that, on Account of the Sins of Witches, the 
Innocent are often Bewitched, yea, Sometimes even for their Own Sins.

Comparison of the Works of Witches with Other Baleful Superstitions.  

Question XVII  A Comparison of their Crimes under Fourteen Heads, with the 
Sins of the Devils of all and every Kind.  

Question XVIII  Here follows the Method of Preaching against and

Controverting Five Arguments of Laymen and Lewd Folk, which seem to be 
Variously Approved, that God does not Allow so Great Power to the Devil and 
Witches as is involved in the Performance of such Mighty Works of 
Witchcraft.  





Question I  Whether the Belief that there are such Beings as Witches is so 
Essential a Part of the Catholic Faith that Obstinacy to maintain the 
Opposite Opinion manifestly savours of Heresy 

        Whether the belief that there are such beings as witches is so 
essential a part of the Catholic faith that obstinately to maintain the 
opposite opinion manifestly savours of heresy. And it is argued that a firm 
belief in witches is not a Catholic doctrine: see chapter 26, question 5, of 
the work of Episcopus. Whoever believes that any creature can be changed for 
the better or the worse, or transformed into another kind or likeness, 
except by the Creator of all things, is worse than a pagan and a heretic. 
And so when they report such things are done by witches it is not Catholic, 
but plainly heretical, to maintain this opinion. 
        Moreover, no operation of witchcraft has a permanent effect among 
us. And this is the proof thereof: For if it were so, it would be effected 
by the operation of demons. But to maintain that the devil has power to 
change human bodies or to do them permanent harm does not seem in accordance 
with the teaching of the Church. For in this way they could destroy the 
whole world, and bring it to utter confusion. 
        Moreover, every alteration that takes place in a human body - for 
example, a state of health or a state of sickness - can be brought down to a 
question of natural causes, as Aristotle has shown in his 7th book of 
Physics. And the greatest of these is the influence of the stars. But the 
devils cannot interfere with the stars. This is the opinion of Dionysius in 
his epistle to S. Polycarp. For this alone God can do. Therefore it is 
evident the demons cannot actually effect any permanent transformation in 
human bodies; that is to say, no real metamorphosis. And so we must refer 
the appearance of any such change to some dark and occult cause. 
        And the power of God is stronger than the power of the devil, so 
divine works are more true than demoniac operations. Whence inasmuch as evil 
is powerful in the world, then it must be the work of the devil always 
conflicting with the work of God. Therefore as it is unlawful to hold that 
the devil's evil craft can apparently exceed the work of God, so it us 
unlawful to believe that the noblest works of creation, that is to say, man 
and beast, can be harmed and spoiled by the power of the devil. 
        Moreover, that which is under the influence of a material object 
cannot have power over corporeal objects. But devils are subservient to 
certain influences of the stars, because magicians observe the course of 
certain stars in order to evoke the devils. Therefore they have not the 
power of effecting any change in a corporeal object, and it follows that 
witches have even less power than the demons possess. 
        For devils have no power at all save by a certain subtle art. But an 
art cannot permanently produce a true form. (And a certain author says: 
Writers on Alchemy know that there is no hope of any real transmutation.) 
Therefore the devils for their part, making use of the utmost of their 
craft, cannot bring about any permanent cure - or permanent disease. But if 
these states exist it is in truth owing to some other cause, which may be 
unknown, and has nothing to do with the operations of either devils or 
witches. 
        But according to the Decretals (33) the contrary is the case. “If by 
witchcraft or any magic art permitted by the secret but most just will of 
God, and aided by the power of the devil, etc . . . . ” The reference here 
is to any act of witchcraft which may hinder the end of marriage, and for 
this impediment to take effect three things can concur, that is to say, 
witchcraft, the devil, and the permission of God. Moreover, the stronger can 
influence that which is less strong. But the power of the devil is stronger 
than any human power (Job xl). There is no power upon earth which can be 
compared to him, who was created so that he fears none. 
        Answer. Here are three heretical errors which must be met, and when 
they have been disproved the truth will be plain. For certain writers, 
pretending to base their opinion upon the words of S. Thomas (iv, 24) when 
he treats of impediments brought about by magic charms, have tried to 
maintain that there is not such a thing as magic, that it only exists in the 
imagination of those men who ascribe natural effects, the cause whereof are 
not known, to witchcraft and spells. There are others who acknowledge indeed 
that witches exist, but they declare that the influence of magic and the 
effects of charms are purely imaginary and phantasmical. A third class of 
writers maintain that the effects said to be wrought by magic spells are 
altogether illusory and fanciful, although it may be that the devil does 
really lend his aid to some witch. 
        The errors held by each one of these persons may thus be set forth 
and thus confuted. For in the very first place they are shown to be plainly 
heretical by many orthodox writers, and especially by S. Thomas, who lays 
down that such an opinion is altogether contrary to the authority of the 
saints and is founded upon absolute infidelity. Because the authority of the 
Holy Scriptures says that devils have power over the bodies and over the 
minds of men, when God allows them to exercise this power, as is plain from 
very many passages in the Holy Scriptures. Therefore those err who say that 
there is no such thing as witchcraft, but that it is purely imaginary, even 
although they do not believe that devils exist except in the imagination of 
the ignorant and vulgar, and the natural accidents which happen to a man he 
wrongly attributes to some supposed devil. For the imagination of some men 
is so vivid that they think they see actual figures and appearances which 
are but the reflection of their thoughts, and then these are believed to be 
the apparitions of evil spirits or even the spectres of witches. But this is 
contrary to the true faith, which teaches us that certain angels fell from 
heaven and are now devils, and we are bound to acknowledge that by their 
very nature they can do many wonderful things which we cannot do. And those 
who try to induce others to perform such evil wonders are called witches. 
And because infidelity in a person who has been baptized is technically 
called heresy, therefore such persons are plainly heretics. 
        As regards those who hold the other two errors, those, that is to 
say, who do not deny that there are demons and that demons possess a natural 
power, but who differ among themselves concerning the possible effects of 
magic and the possible operations of witches: the one school holding that a 
witch can truly bring about certain effects, yet these effects are not real 
but phantastical, the other school allowing that some real harm does befall 
the person or persons injured, but that when a witch imagines this damage is 
the effect of her arts she is grossly deceived. This error seems to be based 
upon two passages from the Canons where certain women are condemned who 
falsely imagine that during the night they ride abroad with Diana or 
Herodias. This may read in the Canon. Yet because such things often happen 
by illusion are merely in the imagination, those who suppose that all the 
effects of witchcraft are mere illusion and imagination are very greatly 
deceived. Secondly, with regard to a man who believes or maintains that a 
creature can be made, or changed for better or for worse, or transformed 
into some other kind or likeness by anyone save by God, the Creator of all 
things, alone, is an infidel and worse than a heathen. Wherefore on account 
of these words “changed for the worse” they say that such an effect if 
wrought by witchcraft cannot be real but must be purely phantastical. 
        But inasmuch as these errors savour of heresy and contradict the 
obvious meaning of the Canon, we will first prove our points by the divine 
law, as also by ecclesiastical and civil law, and first in general. 
        To commence, the expressions of the Canon must be treated of in 
detail (although the sense of the Canon will be even more clearly elucidated 
in the following question). For the divine in many places commands that 
witches are not only to be avoided, but also they are to be put to death, 
and it would not impose the extreme penalty of this kind if witches did not 
really and truly make a compact with devils in order to bring about real and 
true hurts and harms. For the penalty of death is not inflicted except for 
some grave and notorious crime, but it is otherwise with death of the soul, 
which can be brought about by the power of a phantastical illusion or even 
by the stress of temptation. This is the opinion of S. Thomas when he 
discusses whether it be evil to make use of the help of devils (ii. 7). For 
in the 18th chapter of Deuteronomy it is commanded that all wizards and 
charmers are to be destroyed. Also the 19th chapter of Leviticus says: The 
soul which goeth to wizards and soothsayers to commit fornication with them, 
I will set my face against that soul, and destroy it out of the midst of my 
people. And again, 20: A man, or woman, in whom there is a pythonical or 
divining spirit dying, let them die: they shall stone them. Those persons 
are said to be pythons in whom the devil works extraordinary things. 
        Moreover, this must be borne in mind, that on account of this sin 
Ochozias fell sick and died, IV. Kings I. Also Saul, I Paralipomenon, 10. We 
have, moreover, the weighty opinions of the Fathers who have written upon 
the scriptures and who have treated at length of the power of demons and of 
magic arts. The writings of many doctors upon Book 2 of the Sentences may be 
consulted, and it will be found that they all agree, that there are wizards 
and sorcerers who by the power of the devil can produce real and 
extraordinary effects, and these effects are not imaginary, and God permits 
this to be. I will not mention those very many other places where S. Thomas 
in great detail discusses operations of this kind. As, for example, in his 
Summa contra Gentiles, Book 3, c. 1 and 2, in part one, question 114, 
argument 4. And in the Second of the Second, questions 92 and 94. We may 
further consult the Commentators and the Exegetes who have written upon the 
wise men and the magicians of Pharao, Exodus vii. We may also consult what 
S. Augustine says in The City of God, Book 18, c. 17. See further his second 
book On Christian Doctrine. Very many other doctors advance the same 
opinion, and it would be the height of folly for any man to contradict all 
these, and he could not be held to be clear of the guilt of heresy. For any 
man who gravely errs in an exposition of Holy Scripture is rightly 
considered to be a heretic. And whosoever thinks otherwise concerning these 
matters which touch the faith that the Holy Roman Church holds is a heretic. 
There is the Faith. 
        That to deny the existence of witches is contrary to the obvious 
sense of the Canon is shown by ecclesiastical law. For we have the opinions 
of the commentators on the Canon which commences: If anyone by magic arts or 
witchcraft . . . And again, there are those writers who speak of men 
impotent and bewitched, and therefore by this impediment brought about by 
witchcraft they are unable to copulate, and so the contract of marriage is 
rendered void and matrimony in their cases has become impossible. For they 
say, and S. Thomas agrees with them, that if witchcraft takes effect in the 
event of a marriage before there has been carnal copulation, then if it is 
lasting it annuls and destroys the contract of marriage, and it is quite 
plain that such a condition cannot in any way be said to be illusory and the 
effect of imagination. 
        Upon this point see what Blessed Henry of Segusio has so fully 
written in his Summa: also Godfrey of Fontaine and S. Raymond of Peñafort, 
who have discussed this question in detail very clearly, not asking whether 
such a physical condition could be thought imaginary and unreal, but taking 
it to be an actual and proven fact, and then they lay down whether it is to 
be treated as a lasting or temporary infirmity if it continued for more than 
the space of three years, and they do not doubt that it may be brought about 
by the power of witchcraft, although it is true that this condition may be 
intermittent. But what is a fact beyond dispute is that such impotency can 
be brought about through the power of the devil by means of a contract made 
with him, or even by the devil himself without the assistance of any witch, 
although this most rarely happens in the Church, since marriage is a most 
excellent sacrament. But amongst Pagans this actually does happen, and this 
is because evil spirits act as if they had a certain legitimate dominion 
over them, as Peter of Palude in his fourth book relates, when he tells of 
the young man who had pledged himself in wedlock to a certain idol, and who 
nevertheless in the Church the devil prefers to operate through the medium 
of witches and to bring about such effects for his own gain, that is to say, 
for the loss of souls. And in what manner he is able to do this, and by what 
means, will be discussed a little later, where we shall treat of the seven 
ways of doing harm to men by similar operations. And of the other questions 
which Theologians and Canonists have raised with reference to these points, 
one is very important, since they discuss how such impotence can be cured 
and whether it is permissible to cure it by some counter-charm, and what is 
to be done if the witch who cast the spell is dead, a circumstance of which 
Godfrey of Fontaines treats in his Summa. And these questions will be amply 
elucidated in the Third Part of this work. 
        This then is the reason why the Canonists have so carefully drawn up 
a table of the various differing penalties, making a distinction between 
private and open practice of witchcraft, or rather of divination, since this 
foul superstition has various species and degrees, so that anyone who is 
notoriously given to it must be refused Communion. If it be secretly 
practised the culprit must do penance for forty days. And if he be a cleric 
he is to be suspended and confined in a monastery. If he be a layman he 
shall be excommunicated, wherefore all such infamous persons must be 
punished, together with all those who resort to them, and no excuse at all 
is to be allowed. 
        The same penalty too is prescribed by the civil law. For Azo, in his 
Summa upon Book 9 of the Codex, the rubric concerning sorcerers, 2 after the 
lex Cornelia, concerning assassins and murderers, lays down: Let it be known 
that all those who are commonly called sorcerers, and those too who are 
skilled in the art of divination, incur the penalty of death. The same 
penalty is enforced yet again. For this is the exact sentence of these laws: 
It is unlawful for any man to practise divination; and is he does so his 
reward shall be death by the sword of the executioner. There are others too 
who by their magic charms endeavour to take the lives of innocent people, 
who turn the passions of women to lusts of every kind, and these criminals 
are to be thrown to the wild beasts. And the laws allow that any witness 
whatsoever is to be admitted as evidence against them. This the Canon 
treating of the defence of the Faith explicitly enjoins. And the same 
procedure is allowable in a charge of heresy. When such an accusation is 
brought, any witness may come forward to give evidence, just as he may in a 
case of lese-majesty. For witchcraft is high treason against God's Majesty. 
And so they are to be put to the torture in order to make them confess. Any 
person, whatsoever his rank or position, upon such an accusation may be put 
to the torture, and he who is found guilty, even if he confesses his crime, 
let him be racked, let him suffer all other tortures prescribed by law in 
order that he may be punished in proportion to his offences. 
        Note: In days of old such criminals suffered a double penalty and 
were often thrown to wild beast to be devoured by them. Nowadays they are 
burnt at the stake, and probably this is because the majority of them are 
women. 
        The civil law also forbids any conniving at or joining in such 
practices, for it did not allow a diviner even to enter another person's 
house; and often it ordered that all their possessions should be burnt, nor 
was anyone allowed to patronize or to consult them; very often they were 
deported to some distant and deserted island and all their goods sold by 
public auction. Moreover, those who consulted or resorted to witches were 
punished with exile and the confiscation of all their property. These 
penalties were set in operation by the common consent of all nations and 
rulers, and they have greatly conduced to the suppression of the practice of 
such forbidden arts. 
        It should be observed that the laws highly commend those who seek to 
nullify the charms of witches. And those who take great pains that the work 
of man shall not be harmed by the force tempests or by hailstorms are worthy 
of a great reward rather than of any punishment. How such damage may 
lawfully be prevented will be discussed in full below. Accordingly, how can 
it be that the denial or frivolous contradiction of any of these 
propositions can be free from the mark of some notable heresy? Let every man 
judge for himself unless indeed his ignorance excuse him. But what sort of 
ignorance may excuse him we shall very shortly proceed to explain. From what 
has been already said we draw the following conclusion; It is a most certain 
and most Catholic opinion that there are sorcerers and witches who by the 
help of the devil, on account of a compact which they have entered into with 
him, are able, since God allows this, to produce real and actual evils and 
harm, which does not render it unlikely that they can also bring about 
visionary and phantastical illusions by some extraordinary and peculiar 
means. The scope of the present inquiry, however, is witchcraft, and this 
very widely differs from these other arts, and therefore a consideration of 
them would be nothing to the purpose, since those who practise them may with 
greater accuracy be termed fortune-tellers and soothsayers rather than 
sorcerers. 
        It must particularly be noticed that these two last errors are 
founded upon a complete misunderstanding of the words of the Canon (I will 
not speak of the first error, which stands obviously self-condemned, since 
it is clean contrary to the teaching of Holy Scripture). And so let us 
proceed to a right understanding of the Canon. And first we will speak 
against the first error, which says that the mean is mere illusion although 
the two extremes are realities. 
        Here it must be noticed that there are fourteen distinct species 
which come under the genus superstition, but these for the sake of brevity 
it is hardly necessary to detail, since they have been most clearly set out 
by S. Isidore in his Etymologiae, Book 8, and by S. Thomas in his Second of 
the Second, question 92. Moreover, there will be explicit mention of these 
rather lower when we discuss the gravity of this heresy, and this will be in 
the last question of our First Part. 
        The category in which women of this sort are to be ranked is called 
the category of Pythons, persons in or by whom the devil either speaks or 
performs some astonishing operation, and this is often the first category in 
order. But the category under which sorcerers come is called the category of 
Sorcerers. 
        And inasmuch as these persons differ greatly one from another, it 
would not be correct that they should not be comprised in that species under 
which so many others are confined: Wherefore, since the Canon makes explicit 
mention of certain women, but does not in so many words speak of witches; 
therefore they are entirely wrong who understand the Canon only to speak of 
imaginary voyages and goings to and fro in the body and who wish to reduce 
every kind of superstition to this illusion: for as those women are 
transported in their imagination, so are witches actually and bodily 
transported. And he who wishes to argue from this Canon that the effects of 
witchcraft, the infliction of disease or any sickness, are purely imaginary, 
utterly mistakes the tenor of the Canon, and errs most grossly. 
        Further, it is to be observed that those who, whilst they allow the 
two extremes, that is to say, some operation of the devil and the effect, a 
sensible disease, to be actual and real, at the same time deny that any 
instrument is the means thereof; that is to say, they deny that any witch 
could have participated in such a cause and effect, these, I say, err most 
gravely: for, in philosophy, the mean must always partake of the nature of 
the two extremes. 
        Moreover, it is useless to argue that any result of witchcraft may 
be a phantasy and unreal, because such a phantasy cannot be procured without 
resort to the power of the devil, and it is necessary that there should be 
made a contract with the devil, bu which contract the witch truly and 
actually binds herself to be the servant of the devil and devotes herself to 
the devil, and this is not done in any dream or under any illusion, but she 
herself bodily and truly co-operates with, and conjoins herself to, the 
devil. For this indeed is the end of all witchcraft; whether it be the 
casting of spells by a look or by a formula of words or by some other charm, 
it is all of the devil, as will be made clear in the following question. 
        In truth, if anyone cares to read the words of the Canon, there are 
four points which must particularly strike him. And the first point is this: 
It is absolutely incumbent upon all who have the cure of souls, to teach 
their flocks that there is one, only, true God, and that to none other in 
Heaven or earth may worship by given. The second point is this, that 
although these women imagine they are riding (as they think and say) with 
Diana or with Herodias, in truth they are riding with the devil, who calls 
himself by some such heathen name and throws a glamour before their eyes. 
And the third point is this, that the act of riding abroad may be merely 
illusory, since the devil has extraordinary power over the minds of those 
who have given themselves up to him, so that what they do in pure 
imagination, they believe they have actually and really done in the body. 
And the fourth point is this: Witches have made a compact to obey the devil 
in all things, wherefore that the words of the Canon should be extended to 
include and comprise every act of witchcraft is absurd, since witches do 
much more than these women, and witches actually are of a very different 
kind. 
        Whether witches by their magic arts are actually and bodily 
transported from place to place, or whether this merely happens in 
imagination, as is the case with regard to those women who are called 
Pythons, will be dealt with later in this work, and we shall also discuss 
how they are conveyed. So now we have explained two errors, at least, and we 
have arrived at a clear understanding of the sense of the Canon. 
        Moreover, a third error, which mistaking the words of the Canon says 
that all magic arts are illusions, may be corrected from the very words of 
the Canon itself. For inasmuch as it says that he who believes any creature 
can be made or transformed for the better or the worse, or metamorphosed 
into some other species or likeness, save it be by the Creator of all things 
Himself, etc . . . . he is worse than an infidel. These three propositions, 
if they are thus understood as they might appear on the bare face of them, 
are clean contrary to the sense of Holy Scripture and the commentaries of 
the doctors of the Church. For the following Canon clearly says that 
creatures can be made by witches, although they necessarily must be very 
imperfect creatures, and probably in some way deformed. And it is plain that 
the sense of the Canon agrees with what S. Augustine tells us concerning the 
magicians at the court of Pharao, who turned their rods into serpents, as 
the holy doctor writes upon the 7th chapter of Exodus, ver. II, - and Pharao 
called the wise men and the magicians . . . . We may also refer to the 
commentaries of Strabo, who says that devils hurry up and down over the 
whole earth, when by their incantations witches are employing them at 
various operations, and these devils are able to collect various species to 
grow. We may also refer to Blessed Albertus Magnus, De animalibus. And also 
S. Thomas, Part I, question 114, article 4. For the sake of conciseness we 
will not quote them at length here, but this remains proven, that it is 
possible for certain creatures to be created in this way. 
        With reference to the second point, that a creature may be changed 
for better or worse, it is always to be understood that this can only be 
done by the permission and indeed by the power of God, and that this is only 
done in order to correct or to punish, but that God very often allows devils 
to act as His ministers and His servants, but throughout all it is God alone 
who can afflict and it is He alone who can heal, for “I kill and I make 
alive” (Deuteronomy xxxii, 39). And so evil angels may and do perform the 
will of God. To this also S. Augustine bears witness when he says: There are 
in truth magic spells and evil charms, which not only often afflict men with 
diseases but even kill them outright. We must also endeavour clearly to 
understand what actually happens when nowadays by the power of the devil 
wizards and witches are changed into wolves and other savage beasts. The 
Canon, however, speaks of some bodily and lasting change, and does not 
discuss those extraordinary things which may be done by glamour of which S. 
Augustine speaks in the 18th book and the 17th chapter of Of the City of 
God, when he reports many strange tales of that famous witch Circe, and of 
the companions of Diomedes and of the father of Praestantius. This will be 
discussed in detail in the Second Part. 
        The second part of our inquiry is this, whether obstinately to 
maintain that witches exist is heretical. The questions arises whether 
people who hold that witches do not exist are to be regarded as notorious 
heretics, or whether they are to be regarded as gravely suspect of holding 
heretical opinions. It seems that the first opinion is the correct one. For 
this is undoubtedly in accordance with the opinion of the learned Bernard. 
And yet those persons who openly and obstinately persevere in heresy must be 
proved to be heretics by unshaken evidence, and such demonstration is 
generally one of three kinds; either a man has openly preached and 
proclaimed heretical doctrines; or he is proved to be a heretic by the 
evidence of trustworthy witnesses; or he is proved to be a heretic by his 
own free confession. And yet there are some who rashly opposing themselves 
to all authority publicly proclaim that witches do not exist, or at any rate 
that they can in no way afflict and hurt mankind. Wherefore, strictly 
speaking those who are convicted of such evil doctrine may be 
excommunicated, since they are openly and unmistakably to be convicted of 
false doctrine. The reader may consult the works of Bernard, where he will 
find that this sentence is just, right, and true. Yet perhaps this may seem 
to be altogether too severe a judgement mainly because of the penalties 
which follow upon excommunication: for the Canon prescribes that a cleric is 
to be degraded and that a layman is to be handed over to the power of the 
secular courts, who are admonished to punish him as his offence deserves. 
Moreover, we must take into consideration the very great numbers of persons 
who, owing to their ignorance, will surely be found guilty of this error. 
And since the error is very common the rigor of strict justice may be 
tempered with mercy. And it is indeed our intention to try to make excuses 
for those who are guilty of this heresy rather than to accuse them of being 
infected with the malice of heresy. It is preferable then that if a man 
should be even gravely suspected of holding this false opinion he should not 
be immediately condemned for the grave crime of heresy. (See the gloss of 
Bernard upon the word Condemned.) One may in truth proceed against such a 
man as against a person who is gravely suspect, but he is not to be 
condemned in his absence and without a hearing. And yet the suspicion may be 
very grave, and we cannot refrain from suspecting these people, for their 
frivolous assertions do certainly seem to affect the purity of the faith. 
For there are three kinds of suspicion - a light suspicion, a serious 
suspicion, and a grave suspicion. These are treated of in the chapter on 
Accusations and in the chapter on Contumacy, Book 6, on Heretics. And these 
things come under the cognizance of the archidiaconal court. Reference may 
also be made to the commentaries of Giovanni d'Andrea, and in particular to 
his glosses upon the phrases Accused; Gravely suspect; and his note upon a 
presumption of heresy. It is certain too that some who lay down the law on 
this subject do not realize that they are holding false doctrines and 
errors, for there are many who have no knowledge of the Canon law, and there 
are some who, owing to the fact that they are badly informed and 
insufficiently read, waver in their opinions and cannot make up their minds, 
and since an idea merely kept to oneself is not heresy unless it be 
afterwards put forward, obstinately and openly maintained, it should 
certainly be said that persons such as we have just mentioned are not to be 
openly condemned for the crime of heresy. But let no man think he may escape 
by pleading ignorance. For those who have gone astray through ignorance of 
this kind may be found to have sinned very gravely. For although there are 
many degrees of ignorance, nevertheless those who have the cure of souls 
cannot plead invincible ignorance, as the philosophers call it, which by the 
writers on Canon law and by the Theologians is called Ignorance of the Fact. 
But what is to be blamed in these persons is Universal ignorance, that is to 
say, an ignorance of the divine law, which, as Pope Nicholas has laid down, 
they must and should know. For he says: The dispensation of these divine 
teachings is entrusted to our charge: and woe be unto us if we do not sow 
the good seed, woe be unto us if we do not teach our flocks. And so those 
who have the charge of souls are bound to have a sound knowledge of the 
Sacred Scriptures. It is true that according to Raymond of Sabunde and S. 
Thomas, those who have the cure of souls are certainly not bound to be men 
of any extraordinary learning, but they certainly should have a competent 
knowledge, that is to say, knowledge sufficient to carry out the duties of 
their state. 
        And yet, and this may be some small consolation to them, the 
theoretical severity of law is often balanced by the actual practice, and 
they may know that this ignorance of the Canon law, although sometimes it 
may be culpable and worthy of blame, is considered from two points of view. 
For sometimes persons do not know, they do not wish to know, and they have 
no intention of knowing. For such persons there is no excuse, but they are 
to be altogether condemned. And of these the Psalmist speaks: He would not 
understand in order that he might do good. But secondly, there are those who 
are ignorant, yet not from any desire not to know. And this diminishes the 
gravity of the sin, because there is no actual consent of the will. And such 
a case is this, when anyone ought to know something, but cannot realize that 
he ought to know it, as S. Paul says in his 1st Epistle to Timothy (i.13): 
But I obtained the mercy of God, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. 
And this is technically said to be an ignorance, which indirectly at least 
is the fault of the person, insomuch as on account of many of occupations he 
neglects to inform himself of matters which he ought to know, and he does 
not use any endeavour to make himself acquainted with them, and this 
ignorance does not entirely excuse him, but it excuses him to a certain 
degree. So S. Ambrose, writing upon that passage in the Romans (ii, 4): 
Knowest thou not, that the benignity of God leadeth thee to penance? says, 
If thou dost not know through thine own fault then thy sin is very great and 
grievous. More especially then in these days, when souls are beset with so 
many dangers, we must take measures to dispel all ignorance, and we must 
always have before our eyes that sever judgement which will be passed upon 
us if we do not use, everyone according to his proper ability, the one 
talent which has been given. In this way our ignorance will be neither thick 
nor stupid, for metaphorically we speak of men as thick and stupid who do 
not see what lies directly in their very way. 
        And in the Flores regularum moralium the Roman Chancellor commenting 
upon the second rule says: A culpable ignorance of the Divine law does not 
of necessity affect the ignorant person. The reason is this: the Holy Spirit 
is able directly to instruct a man in all that knowledge essential to 
salvation, if these things are too difficult for him to grasp unaided by his 
own natural intellect. 
        The answer to the first objection then is a clear and correct 
understanding of the Canon. To the second objection Peter of Tarentaise 
(Blessed Innocent V) replies: No doubt the devil, owing to his malice which 
he harbours against the human race, would destroy mankind if he were allowed 
by God to do so. The fact that God allows him sometimes to do harm and that 
sometimes God hinders and prevents him, manifestly brings the devil into 
more open contempt and loathing, since in all things, to the manifestation 
of His glory, God is using the devil, unwilling though he be, as a servant 
and slave. With regard to the third objection, that the infliction of 
sickness or some other harm is always the result of human effort, whereby 
the witch submits her will to evil, and so actually as any other evil-doer, 
by the volition of her will can afflict some person or bring about some 
damage or perform some villainous act. If it be asked whether the movement 
of material objects from place to place by the devil may be paralleled by 
the movement of the spheres, the answer is No. Because material objects are 
not thus moved by any natural inherent power of their own, but they are only 
moved by a certain obedience to the power of the devil, who by the virtue of 
his own nature has a certain dominion over bodies and material things; he 
has this certain power, I affirm, yet he is not able to add to created 
material objects any form or shape, be it substantial or accidental, without 
some admixture of or compounding with another created natural object. But 
since, by the will of God, he is able to move material objects from place to 
place, then by the conjunction of various objects he can produce disease or 
some circumstance such as he will. Wherefore the spells and effects of 
witchcraft are not governed by the movement of the spheres, nor is the devil 
himself thus governed, inasmuch as he may often make use of these conditions 
to do him service. 
        The answer to the fourth objection. The work of God can be destroyed 
by the work of the devil in accordance with what we are now saying with 
reference to the power and effects of witchcraft. But since this can only be 
by the permission of God, it does not at all follow that the devil is 
stronger than God. Again, he cannot use so much violence as he wishes to 
harm the works of God, because if he were unrestricted he would utterly 
destroy all the works of God.
        The answer to the fifth objection may be clearly stated thus: The 
planets and stars have no power to coerce and compel devils to perform any 
actions against their will, although seemingly demons are readier to appear 
when summoned by magicians under the influence of certain stars. It appears 
that they do this for two reasons. First, because they know that the power 
of that planet will aid the effect which the magicians desire. Secondly, 
They do this in order to deceive men, thus making them suppose that the 
stars have some divine power or actual divinity, and we know that in days of 
old this veneration of the stars led to the vilest idolatry. 

        With reference to the last objection, which is founded upon the 
argument that gold is made by alchemists, we may put forward the opinion of 
S. Thomas when he discusses the power of the devil and how he works: 
Although certain forms having a substance may be brought about by art and 
the power of a natural agent, as, for example, the form fire is brought 
about by art employed on wood: nevertheless, this cannot be done 
universally, because art cannot always either find or yet mix together the 
proper proportions, and yet it can produce something similar. And thus 
alchemists make something similar to gold, that is to say, in so far as the 
external accidents are concerned, but nevertheless they do not make true 
gold, because the substance of gold is not formed by the heat of fire which 
alchemists employ, but by the heat of the sun, acting and reacting upon a 
certain spot where mineral power is concentrated and amassed, and therefore 
such gold is of the same likeness as, but is not of the same species as, 
natural gold. And the same argument applies to all their other operations. 

        This then is our proposition: devils by their act do bring about 
evil effects through witchcraft, yet it is true that without the assistance 
of some agent they cannot make any form, either substantial or accidental, 
and we do not maintain that they can inflict damage without the assistance 
of some agent, but with such an agent diseases, and any other human passions 
or ailments, can be brought about, and these are real and true. How these 
agents or how the employment of such means can be rendered effective in co-
operation with devils will be made clear in the following chapters. 




Question II  If it be in Accordance with the Catholic Faith to maintain that 
in Order to bring about some Effect of Magic, the Devil must intimately co-
operate with the Witch, or whether one without the other, that is to say, 
the Devil without the Witch, or conversely, could produce such an Effect.  

        If it be in accordance with the Catholic Faith to maintain that in 
order to bring about some effect of magic, the devil must intimately co-
operate with the witch, or whether one without the other, that is to say, 
the devil without the witch, or conversely, could produce such an effect. 
        And the first argument is this: That the devil can bring about an 
effect of magic without the co-operation of any witch. So S. Augustine 
holds. All things which visibly happen so that they can be seen, may (it is 
believed) be the work of the inferior powers of the air. But bodily ills and 
ailments are certainly not invisible, nay rather, they are evident to the 
senses, therefore they can be brought about by devils. Moreover, we learn 
from the Holy Scriptures of the disasters which fell upon Job, how fire fell 
from heaven and striking the sheep and the servants consumed them, and how a 
violent wind threw down the four corners of a house so that it fell upon his 
children and slew them all. The devil by himself without the co-operation of 
any witches, but merely by God's permission alone, was able to bring about 
all these disasters. Therefore he can certainly do many things which are 
often ascribed to the work of witches. 
        And this is obvious from the account of the seven husbands of the 
maiden Sara, whom a devil killed. Moreover, whatever a superior power is 
able to do, it is able to do without reference to a power superior to it, 
and a superior power can all the more work without reference to an inferior 
power. But an inferior power can cause hailstorms and bring about diseases 
without the help of a power greater than itself. For Blessed Albertus Magnus 
in his work De passionibus aeris says that rotten sage, if used as he 
explains, and thrown into running water, will arouse most fearful tempests 
and storms.
        Moreover, it may be said that the devil makes use of a witch, not 
because he has need of any such agent, but because he is seeking the 
perdition of the witch. We may refer to what Aristotle says in the 3rd book 
of his Ethics. Evil is a voluntary act which is proved by the fact that 
nobody performs an unjust action, and a man who commits a rape does this for 
the sake of pleasure, not merely doing evil for evil's sake. Yet the law 
punishes those who have done evil as if they had acted merely for the sake 
of doing evil. Therefore if the devil works by means of a witch he is merely 
employing an instrument; and since an instrument depends upon the will of 
the person who employs it and does not act of its own free will, therefore 
the guilt of the action ought not to be laid to the charge of the witch, and 
in consequence she should not be punished. 
        But an opposite opinion holds that the devil cannot so easily and 
readily do harm by himself to mankind, as he can harm them through the 
instrumentality of witches, although they are his servants. In the first 
place we may consider the act of generation. But for every act which has an 
effect upon another some kind of contact must be established, and because 
the devil, who is a spirit, can have no such actual contact with a human 
body, since there is nothing common of this kind between them, therefore he 
uses some human instruments, and upon these he bestows the power of hurting 
by bodily touch. And many hold this to be proven by the text, and the gloss 
upon the text, in the 3rd chapter of S. Paul's Epistle to the Galatians: O 
senseless Galatians, who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the 
truth? And the gloss upon this passage refers to those who have singularly 
fiery and baleful eyes, who by a mere look can harm others, especially young 
children. And Avicenna also bears this out, Naturalism, Book 3, c. the last, 
when he says; “Very often the soul may have as much influence upon the body 
of another to the same extent as it has upon its own body, for such is the 
influence of the eyes of anyone who by his glance attracts and fascinates 
another.” And the same opinion is maintained by Al-Gazali in the 5th book 
and 10th c. of his Physics. Avicenna also suggests, although he does not put 
this opinion forward as irrefutable, that the power of the imagination can 
actually change or seem to change extraneous bodies, in cases where the 
power of the imagination is too unrestrained; and hence we father that the 
power of the imagination is not to be considered as distinct from a man's 
other sensible powers, since it is common to them all, but to some extent it 
includes all those other powers. And this is true, because such a power of 
the imagination can change adjacent bodies, as, for example, when a man is 
able to walk along some narrow beam which is stretched down the middle of a 
street. But yet if this beam were suspended over deep water he would not 
dare to walk along it, because his imagination would most strongly impress 
upon his mind the idea of falling, and therefore his body and the power of 
his limbs would not obey his imagination, and they would not obey the 
contrary thereto, that is to say, walking directly and without hesitation. 
This change may be compared to the influence exercised by the eyes of a 
person who has such influence, and so a mental change is brought about 
although there is not any actual and bodily change.
        Moreover, if it be argued that such a change is cause by a living 
body owing to the influence of the mind upon some other living body, this 
answer may be given. In the presence of a murderer blood flows from the 
wounds in the corpse of the person he has slain. Therefore without any 
mental powers bodies can produce wonderful effects, and so a living man if 
he pass by near the corpse of a murdered man, although he may not be aware 
of the dead body, is often seized with fear.
        Again, there are some things in nature which have certain hidden 
powers, the reason for which man does not know; such, for example, is the 
lodestone, which attracts steel and many other such things, which S. 
Augustine mentions in the 20th book Of the City of God. 

        And so women in order to bring about changes in the bodies of others 
sometimes make use of certain things, which exceed our knowledge, but this 
is without any aid from the devil. And because these remedies are mysterious 
we must not therefore ascribe them to the power of the devil as we should 
ascribe evil spells wrought by witches.
        Moreover, witches use certain images and other strange periapts, 
which they are wont to place under the lintels of the doors of houses, or in 
those meadows where flocks are herding, or even where men congregate, and 
thus they cast spells over their victims, who have oft-times been known to 
die. But because such extraordinary effects can proceed from these images it 
would appear that the influence of these images is in proportion to the 
influence of the stars over human bodies, for as natural bodies are 
influenced by heavenly bodies, so may artificial bodies likewise be thus 
influenced. But natural bodies may find the benefit of certain secret but 
good influences. Therefore artificial bodies may receive such influence. 
Hence it is plain that those who perform works of healing may well perform 
them by means of such good influences, and this has no connexion at all with 
any evil power. 

        Moreover, it would seem that most extraordinary and miraculous 
events come to pass by the working of the power of nature. For wonderful and 
terrible and amazing things happen owing to natural forces. And this S. 
Gregory points out in his Second Dialogue. The Saints perform miracles, 
sometimes by a prayer, sometimes by their power alone. There are examples of 
each; S. Peter by praying raised to life Tabitha, who was dead. By rebuking 
Ananias and Sapphira, who were telling a lie, he slew the without any 
prayer. Therefore a man by his mental influence can change a material body 
into another, or he can change such a body from health to sickness and 
conversely.
        Moreover, the human body is nobler than any other body, but because 
of the passions of the mind the human body changes and becomes hot or cold, 
as is the case with angry men or men who are afraid: and so even greater 
change takes place with regard to the effects of sickness and death, which 
by their power can greatly change a material body.
        But certain objections must be allowed. The influence of the mind 
cannot make an impression upon any form except by the intervention of some 
agent, as we have said above. And these are the words of S. Augustine in the 
book which we have already quoted: It is incredible that the angels who fell 
from Heaven should be obedient to any material things, for the obey God 
only. And much less can a man of his natural power bring about extraordinary 
and evil effects. The answer must be made, there are even to-day many who 
err greatly on this point, making excuses for witches and laying the whole 
blame upon the craft of the devil, or ascribing the changes that they work 
to some natural alteration. These errors may be easily made clear. First, by 
the description of witches which S. Isidore gives in his Etymologiae, c. 9: 
Witches are so called on account of the blackness of their guilt, that is to 
say, their deeds are more evil than those of any other malefactors. He 
continues: They stir up and confound the elements by the aid of the devil, 
and arouse terrible hailstorms and tempests. Moreover, he says they distract 
the minds of men, driving them to madness, insane hatred, and inordinate 
lusts. Again, he continues, by the terrible influence of their spells alone, 
as it were by a draught of poison, they can destroy life.
        And the words of S. Augustine in his book on The City of God are 
very much to the point, for he tells us who magicians and witches really 
are. Magicians, who are commonly called witches, are thus termed on account 
of the magnitude of their evil deeds. These are they who by the permission 
of God disturb the elements, who drive to distraction the minds of men, such 
as have lost their trust in God, and by the terrible power of their evil 
spells, without any actual draught or poison, kill human beings. As Lucan 
says: A mind which has not been corrupted by any noxious drink perishes 
forspoken by some evil charm. For having summoned devils to their aid they 
actually dare to heap harms upon mankind, and even to destroy their enemies 
by their evil spells. And it is certain that in operations of this kind the 
witch works in close conjunction with the devil. Secondly, punishments are 
of four kinds: beneficial, hurtful, wrought by witchcraft, and natural. 
Beneficial punishments are meted out by the ministry of good Angels, just as 
hurtful punishments proceed from evil spirits. Moses smote Egypt with ten 
plagues by the ministry of good Angels, and the magicians were only able to 
perform three of these miracles by the aid of the devil. And the pestilence 
which fell upon the people for three days because of the sin of David who 
numbered the people, and the 72,000 men who were slain in one night in the 
army of Sennacherib, were miracles wrought by the Angels of God, that is, by 
good Angels who feared God and knew that they were carrying out His 
commands.
        Destructive harm, however, is wrought by the medium of bad angels, 
at whose hands the children of Israel in the desert were often afflicted. 
And those harms which are simply evil and nothing more are brought about by 
the devil, who works through the medium of sorcerers and witches. There are 
also natural harms which in some manner depend upon the conjunction of 
heavenly bodies, such as dearth, drought, tempests, and similar effects of 
nature. 

        It is obvious that there is a vast difference between all these 
causes, circumstances, and happenings. For Job was afflicted by the devil 
with a harmful disease, but this is nothing to the purpose. And if anybody 
who is too clever and over-curious asks how it was that Job was afflicted 
with this disease by the devil without the aid of some sorcerer or witch, 
let him know that he is merely beating the air and not informing himself as 
to the real truth. For in the time of Job there were no sorcerers and 
witches, and such abominations were not yet practised. But the providence of 
God wished that by the example of Job the power of the devil even over good 
men might be manifested, so that we might learn to be on our guard against 
Satan, and, moreover, by the example of this holy patriarch the glory of God 
shines abroad, since nothing happens save what is permitted by God. 

        With regard to the time at which this evil superstition, witchcraft, 
appeared, we must first distinguish the worshippers of the devil from those 
who were merely idolaters. And Vincent of Beauvais in his Speculum 
historiale, quoting many learned authorities, says that he who first 
practised the arts of magic and of astrology was Zoroaster, who is said to 
have been Cham the son of Noe. And according to S. Augustine in his book Of 
the City of God, Cham laughed aloud when he was born, and thus showed that 
he was a servant of the devil, and he, although he was a great and mighty 
king, was conquered by Ninus the son of Belus, who built Ninive, whose reign 
was the beginning of the kingdom of Assyria in the time of Abraham.
        Thus Ninus, owing to his insane love for his father, when his father 
was dead, ordered a statue of his father to be made, and whatever criminal 
took refuge there was free from any punishment which he might have incurred. 
From this time men began to worship images as though they were gods; but 
this was after the earliest years of history, for in the very first ages 
there was no idolatry, since in the earliest times men still preserved some 
remembrance of the creation of the world, as S. Thomas says, Book 2, 
question 95, article 4. Or it may have originated with Nembroth, who 
compelled men to worship fire; and thus in the second age of the world there 
began Idolatry, which is the first of all superstitions, as Divination is 
the second, and the Observing of Times and Seasons the third.
        The practices of witches are included in the second kind of 
superstition, which is to say Divination, since the expressly invoke the 
devil. And there are three kinds of this superstition: - Necromancy, 
Astrology, or rather Astromancy, the superstitious observation of stars, and 
Oneiromancy.
        I have explained all this at length that the reader may understand 
that these evil arts did not suddenly burst upon the world, but rather were 
developed in the process of time, and therefore it was not impertinent to 
point out that there were no witches in the days of Job. For as the years 
went by, as S. Gregory says in his Moralia, the knowledge of the Saints 
grew: and therefore the evil craft of the devil likewise increased. The 
prophet Isaias says: The earth is filled with the knowledge of the Lord (xi, 
6). And so in this twilight and evening of the world, when sin is 
flourishing on every side and in every place, when charity is growing cold, 
the evil of witches and their inequities superabound.
        And since Zoroaster was wholly given up to the magic arts, it was 
the devil alone who inspired him to study and observe the stars. Very early 
did sorcerers and witches make compacts with the devil and connive with him 
to bring harm upon human beings. This is proved in the seventh chapter of 
Exodus, where the magicians of Pharao by the power of the devil wrought 
extraordinary wonders, imitating those plagues which Moses had brought upon 
Egypt by the power of good angels.
        Hence it follows the Catholic teaching, that in order to bring about 
evil a witch can and does co-operate with the devil. And any objections to 
this may briefly be answered thus. 
        1. In the first place, nobody denies that certain harms and damages 
which actually and visibly afflict men, animals, the fruits of the earth, 
and which often come about by the influence of stars, may yet often be 
brought about by demons, when God permits them do to act. For as S. 
Augustine says in the 4th book Of the City of God: Demons may make use of 
both fire and air if God allow them so to do. And a commentator remarks: God 
punishes by the power of evil angels.
        2. From this obviously follows the answer to any objection 
concerning Job, and to any objections which may be raised to our account of 
the beginnings of magic in the world.
        3. With regard to the fact that rotten sage which is thrown into 
running water is said to produce some evil effect without the help of the 
devil, although it may not be wholly disconnected with the influence of 
certain stars, we would point out that we do not intend to discuss the good 
or evil influence of the stars, but only witchcraft, and therefore this is 
beside the point.
        4. With regard to the fourth argument, it is certainly true that the 
devil only employs witches to bring about their bale and destruction. But 
when it is deduced that they are not to be punished, because they only act 
as instruments which are moved not by their own volition but at the will and 
pleasure of the principal and agent, there is a ready answer: For they are 
human instruments and free agents, and although they have made a compact and 
a contract with the devil, nevertheless they do enjoy absolute liberty: for, 
as has been learnt from their own revelations - and I speak of women who 
have been convicted and burned at the stake and who were compelled to wreak 
vengeance and evil and damage if they wished to escape punishments and blows 
inflicted by the devil - yet these women co-operate with the devil although 
they are bound to him by that profession by which at first they freely and 
willingly gave themselves over to his power. 

        With regard to these other arguments, in which it is proved that 
certain old women have an occult knowledge which enables them to bring about 
extraordinary and indeed evil effects without the aid of the devil. It must 
be understood that from one particular to conclude a universal argument is 
contrary to all sound reason. And when, as it seems, throughout the whole of 
the Scriptures no such instance can be found, save where it speaks of the 
charms and spells old women practise, therefore we must not hence conclude 
that this is always the case. Moreover, the authorities on these passages 
leave the matter open to question, that is to say, whether such charms have 
any efficacy without the co-operation of the devil. These charms or 
fascinations seem capable of division into three kinds. First, the senses 
are deluded, and this may truly be done by magic, that is to say, by the 
power of the devil, if God permit it. And the senses may be enlightened by 
the power of good angels. Secondly, fascination may bring about a certain 
glamour and a leading astray, as when the apostle says: Who hath bewitched 
you? Galatians iii, I. In the third place, there may be a certain 
fascination cast by the eyes over another person, and this may be harmful 
and bad.
        And it is of this fascination that Avicenna and Al-Gazali have 
spoken; S. Thomas to thus mentions this fascination, Part I, question 117. 
For he says the mind of a man may be changed by the influence of another 
mind. And that influence which is exerted over another often proceeds from 
the eyes, for in the eyes a certain subtle influence may be concentrated. 
For the eyes direct their glance upon a certain object without taking notice 
of other things, and although the vision be perfectly clear, yet at the 
sight of some impurity, such, for example, a woman during her monthly 
periods, the eyes will as it were contract a certain impurity. This is what 
Aristotle says in his work On Sleep and Waking, and thus if anybody's spirit 
be inflamed with malice or rage, as is often the case with old women, then 
their disturbed spirit looks through their eyes, for their countenances are 
most evil and harmful, and often terrify young children of tender years, who 
are extremely impressionable. And it may be that this is often natural, 
permitted by God; on the other hand, it may be that these evil looks are 
often inspired by the malice of the devil, with whom old witches have made 
some secret contract.
        The next question arises with regard to the influence of the 
heavenly bodies, and here we find three very common errors, but these will 
be answered as we proceed to the explain other matters. 

        With regard to operations of witchcraft, we find that some of these 
may be due to mental influence over others, and in some cases such mental 
influence might be a good one, but it is the motive which makes it evil.
        And there are four principal arguments which are to be objected 
against those who deny that there are witches, or magical operations, which 
may be performed at the conjunction of certain planets and stars, and that 
by the malice of human beings harm may be wrought through fashioning images, 
though the use of spells, and by the writing of mysterious characters. All 
theologians and philosophers agree that the heavenly bodies are guided and 
directed by certain spiritual mediums. But those spirits are superior to our 
minds and souls, just as the heavenly bodies are superior to other bodies, 
and therefore they can influence both the mind and body of a man, so that he 
is persuaded and directed to perform some human act. But in order yet more 
fully to attempt a solution of these matters, we may consider certain 
difficulties from a discussion of which we shall yet more clearly arrive at 
the truth. First, spiritual substance cannot change bodies to some other 
natural form unless it be through the mediumship of some agent. Therefore, 
however strong a mental influence may be, it cannot effect any change in a 
man's mind or disposition. Moreover, several universities, especially that 
of Paris, have condemned the following article: - That an enchanter is able 
to cast a camel into a deep ditch merely by directing his gaze upon it. And 
so this article is condemned, that a corporeal body should obey some 
spiritual substance if this be understood simply, that is to say, if the 
obedience entails some actual change or transformation. For in regard to 
this it is God alone Who is absolutely obeyed. Bearing these points in mind 
we may soon see how that fascination, or influence of the eyes of which we 
have spoken, is possible. For it is not possible that a man through the 
natural powers of his mind should direct such power from his eyes that, 
without the agency of his own body or of some other medium, he should be 
able to do harm to the body of another man. Nor is it possible that a man 
through the natural powers of his mind should at his will bring about some 
change, and by directing this power through the mediumship of his eyes 
entirely transform the body of a man, upon whom he fixes his gaze, just as 
his will and pleasure may be.
        And therefore in neither of these ways can one man influence another 
and fascinate another, for no man by the natural powers of his mind alone 
possesses such an extraordinary influence. Therefore, to wish to prove that 
evil effects can be produced by some natural power is to say that this 
natural power is the power of the devil, which is very far indeed from the 
truth.
        Nevertheless, we may more clearly set forth how it is possible for a 
careful gaze to do harm. It may so happen that if a man or a woman gaze 
steadfastly at some child, the child, owing to its power of sight and power 
of imagination, may receive some very sensible and direct impression. And an 
impression of this kind is often accompanied by a bodily change, and since 
the eyes are one of the tenderest organs of the body, therefore they are 
very liable to such impressions. Therefore it may well happen that the eyes 
receive some bad impression and change for the worse, since very often the 
thoughts of the mind or the motions of the body are particularly impressed 
upon and shown by the eyes. And so it may happen that some angry and evil 
gaze, if it has been steadfastly fixed and directed upon a child, may so 
impress itself upon that child's memory and imagination that it may reflect 
itself in the gaze of the child, and actual results will follow, as, for 
example, he may lose his appetite and be unable to take food, he may sicken 
and fall ill. And sometimes we see that the sight of a man who is suffering 
from his eyes may cause the eyes of those who gaze upon him to dazzle and 
feel weak, although to a large extent this is nothing else but the effect of 
pure imagination. Several other examples of the same sort might be discussed 
here, but for the sake of conciseness we will not discuss them in any 
further detail.
        All this is borne out of the commentators upon the Psalm, Qui timent 
te uidebunt me. There is a great power in the eyes, and this appears even in 
natural things. For if a wolf see a man first, the man is struck dumb. 
Moreover, if a basilisk see a man first its look is fatal; but if he see it 
first he may be able to kill it; and the reason why the basilisk is able to 
kill a man by its gaze is because when it sees him, owing to its anger a 
certain terrible poison is set in motion throughout its body, and this it 
can dart from its eyes, thus injecting the atmosphere with deadly venom. And 
thus the man breathes in the air which it has infected and is stupefied and 
dies. But when the beast is first seen by the man, in a case when the man 
wishes to kill the basilisk, he furnishes himself with mirrors, and the 
beast seeing itself in the mirrors darts out poison towards it reflection, 
but the poison recoils and the animal dies. It does not seem plain, however, 
why the man who thus kills the basilisk should not die too, and we can only 
conclude that this is on account of some reason not clearly understood.
        So far we have set down our opinions absolutely without prejudice 
and refraining from any hasty or rash judgement, not deviating from the 
teachings and writings of the Saints. We conclude, therefore, that the 
Catholic truth is this, that to bring about these evils which form the 
subject of discussion, witches and the devil always work together, and that 
in so far as these matters are concerned one can do nothing without the aid 
and assistance of the other. 

        We have already treated of this fascination. And now with reference 
to the second point, namely, that blood will flow from a corpse in the 
presence of a murderer. According to the Speculum naturale of Vincent of 
Beauvis, c. 13, the wound is, as it were, influenced by the mind of the 
murderer, and that wound receives a certain atmosphere which has been 
impressed by and is permeated with his violence and hatred, and when the 
murderer draws near, the blood wells up and gushes forth from the corpse. 
For it would seem that this atmosphere, which was cause and as it were 
entered the wound owing to the murderer, at his presence is disturbed and 
greatly moved, and it is owing to this movement that the blood streams out 
of the dead body. There are some who declared that it is due to some other 
causes, and they say that this gushing forth of blood is the voice of the 
blood crying from the earth against the murderer who is present, and that 
this is on account of the curse pronounced against the murderer Cain. And 
with regard to that horror which a person feels when he is passing near the 
corpse of a man who has been murdered, although he may not be in any way 
cognizant of the vicinity of a dead body, this horror is psychic, it infects 
the atmosphere and conveys a thrill of fear to the mind. But all these 
explanations, be it noted, do not in any way affect the truth of the evil 
wrought by witches, since they are all perfectly natural and arise from 
natural causes.
        In the third place, as we have already said above, the operations 
and rites of witches are placed in that second category of superstition 
which is called Divination; and of this divination there are three kinds, 
but the argument does not hold good with reference to the third kind, which 
belongs to a different species, for witchcraft is not merely any divination, 
but it is that divination, the operations of which are performed by express 
and explicit invocations of the devil; and this may be done in very many 
ways, as by Necromancy, Geomancy, Hydromancy, etc.
        Wherefore this divination, which is used when they are working their 
spells, must be judged to be the height of criminal wickedness, although 
some have attempted to regard it from another point of view. And they argue 
thus, that as we do not know the hidden powers of nature, it may be that the 
witches are merely employing or seeking to employ these hidden powers: 
assuredly if they are employing the natural power of natural things to bring 
about a natural effect, this must be perfectly lawful. as indeed is obvious 
enough. Or even let us conceive that if the superstitiously employ natural 
things, as, for example, by writing down certain characters or unknown names 
of some kind, and that then they use these runes for restoring a person to 
health, or for inducing friendship, or with some useful end, and not at all 
for doing any damage or harm, in such cases, it may be granted, I say, that 
there is no express invocation of demons; nevertheless it cannot be that 
these spells are employed without a tacit invocation, wherefore all such 
charms must be judge to be wholly unlawful.
        And because these and many other charms like to them may be placed 
in the third category of superstition, that is to say, idle and vain 
observing of time and seasons, this is by no means a relevant argument as to 
the heresy of witches. But of this category, the observing of times and 
seasons, there are four distinct species: A man may use such observations to 
acquire certain knowledge: or he may in this way seek to inform himself 
concerning lucky or unlucky days and things: or he may use sacred words and 
prayers as a charm with no reference to their meaning: or he may intend and 
desire to bring about some beneficial change in some body. All this S. 
Thomas has amply treated in that question where he asks, Whether such 
observing be lawful, especially if it be to bring about a beneficial change 
in a body, that is to say, the restoration of persons to health. But when 
witches observe times and seasons, their practices must be held to belong to 
the second kind of superstition, and therefore, in so far as they are 
concerned, questions concerning this third class are wholly impertinent.
        We now proceed to a fourth proposition, inasmuch as from 
observations of the kind we have discussed certain charts and images are 
wont to be made, but these are of two separate sorts, which differ entirely 
one from the other; and these are Astronomical and Necromantic. Now in 
Necromancy there is always an express and particular invocation of demons, 
for this craft implies that there has been an express compact and contract 
with them. Let us therefore only consider Astrology. In Astrology there is 
no compact, and therefore there is no invocation, unless by chance there be 
some kind of tacit invocation, since the figures of demons and their names 
sometimes appear in Astrological charts. And again, Necromantic signs are 
written under the influence of certain stars in order to counteract the 
influence and oppositions of other heavenly bodies, and these are inscribed, 
for signs and characters of this kind are often engraved upon rings, gems, 
or some other precious metal, but magic signs are engraved without any 
reference to the influence of the stars, and often upon any substance, nay, 
even upon vile and sordid substances, which when buried in certain places 
bring about damage and harm and disease. But we are discussing charts which 
are made with reference to the stars. And these Necromantic charts and 
images have no reference to any heavenly body. Therefore a consideration of 
them does not enter into the present discussion.
        Moreover, many of these images which have been made with 
superstitious rites have no efficacy at all, that is to say, in so far as 
the fashioning of them is concerned, although it may be that the material of 
which they are made does possess a certain power, although this is not due 
to the fact that they were made under the influence of certain stars. Yet 
many hold that it is in any case unlawful to make use even of images like 
these. But the images made by witches have no natural power at all, nor has 
the material of which they are formed any power; but they fashion such 
images by command of the devil, that by so doing they may, as it were, mock 
the work of the Creator, and that they may provoke Him to anger so that in 
punishment of their misdeeds He may suffer plagues to fall upon the earth. 
And in order to increase their guilt they delight especially to fashion many 
such images at the more solemn seasons of the year.
        With regard to the fifth point, S. Gregory is there speaking of the 
power of grace and not of the power of nature. And since, as S. John says, 
we are born of God, what wonder then that the sons of God enjoy 
extraordinary powers.
        With regard to the last point we will say this, that a mere likeness 
is irrelevant, because the influence of one's own mind on one's own body is 
different from its influence upon another body as though the body were the 
material form of the mind, and the emotions are an act of the body, but 
separate, therefore the emotion can be changed by the influence of the mind 
whensoever there is some bodily change, heat or cold, or any alteration, 
even to death itself. But to change the actual body, no act of the mind is 
sufficient by itself, unless there can be some physical result which alters 
the body. Whence witches, by the exercise of no natural power, but only by 
the help of the devil, are able to bring about harmful effects. And the 
devils themselves can only do this by the use of material objects as their 
instruments, such as bones, hair, wood, iron, and all sorts of objects of 
this kind, concerning which operation we shall treat more fully a little 
later.
        Now with regard to the tenor of the Bull of our Most Holy Father the 
Pope, we will discuss the origin of witches, and how it is that of recent 
years their works have so multiplied among us. And it must be borne in mind 
that for this to take place, three things concur, the devil, the witch, and 
the permission of God who suffers such things to be. For S. Augustine says, 
that the abomination of witchcraft arose from this foul connexion of mankind 
with the devil. Therefore it is plain that the origin and the increase of 
this heresy arises from this foul connexion, a fact which many authors 
approve.
        We must especially observe that this heresy, witchcraft, not only 
differs from all other heresy in this, that not merely by a tacit compact, 
but by a compact which is exactly defined and expressed it blasphemes the 
Creator and endeavours to the utmost to profane Him and to harm His 
creatures, for all other simple heresies have made no open compact with the 
devil, no compact, that is, either tacit or exactly expressed, although 
their errors and misbelief are directly to be attributed to the Father of 
errors and lies. Moreover, witchcraft differs from all other harmful and 
mysterious arts in this point, that of all superstition it is essentially 
the vilest, the most evil and the worst, wherefore it derives its name from 
doing evil, and from blaspheming the true faith. (Melaficae dictae a 
Melficiendo, seu a male de fide sentiendo.)
        Let us especially note too that in the practice of this abominable 
evil, four points in particular are required. First, most profanely to 
renounce the Catholic Faith, or at any rate to deny certain dogmas of the 
faith; secondly, to devote themselves body and soul to all evil; thirdly, to 
offer up unbaptized children to Satan; fourthly, to indulge in every kind of 
carnal lust with Incubi and Succubi and all manner of filthy delights. 
        Would to God that we might suppose all this to be untrue and merely 
imaginary, if only our Holy Mother the Church were free from the leprosy of 
such abomination. Alas, the judgement of the Apostolic See, who is alone the 
Mistress and the Teacher of all truth, that judgement, I say, which has been 
expressed in the Bull of our Holy Father the Pope, assures us and makes us 
aware that amongst us, and we dare not refrain from inquiring into them lest 
we imperil our own salvation. And therefore we must discuss at length the 
origin and the increase of these abominations; it has been a work of much 
labour indeed, and we trust that every detail will most exactly and 
carefully be weighed by those who read this book, for herein will be found 
nothing contrary to sound reason, nothing which differs from the words of 
Scripture and the tradition of the Fathers.
        Now there are two circumstances which are certainly very common at 
the present day, that is to say, the connexion of witches with familiars, 
Incubi and Succubi, and the horrible sacrifices of small children. Therefore 
we shall particularly deal with these matters, so that in the first place we 
shall discuss these demons themselves, secondly, the witches and their 
works, and thirdly, we will inquire wherefore such things are suffered to 
be. Now these demons work owing to their influence upon man's mind and upon 
his free will, and they choose to copulate under the influence of certain 
stars rather than under the influence of others, for it would seem that at 
certain times their semen can more easily generate and beget children. 
Accordingly, we must inquire why the demons should act at the conjunction of 
certain stars, and what times these are.
        There are three chief points to discuss. First, whether the 
abominable heresies can be multiplied throughout the world by those who give 
themselves to Incubi and Succubi. Secondly, whether their actions have not a 
certain extraordinary power when performed under the influence of certain 
stars. Thirdly, whether this abominable heresy is not widely spread by those 
who profanely sacrifice children to Satan. Moreover, when we have discussed 
the second point, before we proceed to the third, we must consider the 
influence of the stars, and what power they have in acts of witchcraft.
        With regard to the first question there are three difficulties which 
need elucidation.
        The first is a general consideration of these demons, which are 
called Incubi.
        The second question is more particular, for we must inquire, How can 
these Incubi perform the human act of copulation?
        The third question is also a special one, How do witches bind 
themselves to and copulate with these devils? 




Question III  Whether Children can be Generated by Incubi and Succubi.  

        At first it may truly seem that it is not in accordance with the 
Catholic Faith to maintain that children can be begotten by devils, that is 
to say, by Incubi and Succubi: for God Himself, before sin came into the 
world, instituted human procreation, since He created woman from the rib of 
man to be a helpmeet unto man: And to them He said: Increase, and multiply, 
Genesis ii, 24. Likewise after sin had come into the world, it was said to 
Noe: Increase, and multiply, Genesis ix, 1. In the time of the new law also, 
Christ confirmed this union: Have ye not read, that he who made man from the 
beginning, Made them male and female? S. Matthew xix, 4. Therefore, men 
cannot be begotten in any other way than this.
        But it may be argued that devils take their part in this generation 
not as the essential cause, but as a secondary and artificial cause, since 
they busy themselves by interfering with the process of normal copulation 
and conception, by obtaining human semen, and themselves transferring it.
        Objection. The devil can perform this act in every state of life, 
that is to say, in the matrimonial state, or not in the matrimonial state. 
Now he cannot perform it in the first state, because then the act of the 
devil would be more powerful than the act of God, Who instituted and 
confirmed this holy estate, since it is a state of continence and wedlock. 
Nor can he effect this in any other estate: since we never read in Scripture 
that children can be begotten in one state and not in another.

        Moreover, to beget a child is the act of a living body, but devils 
cannot bestow life upon the bodies which they assume; because life formally 
only proceeds from the soul, and the act of generation is the act of the 
physical organs which have bodily life. Therefore bodies which are assumed 
in this way cannot either beget or bear.
        Yet it may be said that these devils assume a body not in order that 
they may bestow life upon it, but that they may by the means of this body 
preserve human semen, and pass the semen on to another body.
        Objection. As in the action of angels, whether they be good or bad, 
there is nothing superfluous and useless, nor is there anything superfluous 
and useless in nature. But the devil by his natural power, which is far 
greater than any human bodily power, can perform any spiritual action, and 
perform it again and again although man may not be able to discern it. 
Therefore he is able to perform this action, although man may not be able to 
discern when the devil is concerned therewith. For all bodily and material 
things are on a lower scale than pure and spiritual intelligences. But the 
angels, whether they be good or whether they be evil, are pure and spiritual 
intelligences. Therefore they can control what is below them. Therefore the 
devil can collect and make use as he will of human semen which belongs to 
the body.
        However, to collect human semen from one person and to transfer it 
to another implies certain local actions. But devils cannot locally move 
bodies from place to place. And this is the argument they put forward. The 
soul is purely a spiritual essence, so is the devil: but the soul cannot 
move a body from place to place except it be that body in which it lives and 
to which it gives life: whence if any member of the body perishes it becomes 
dead and immovable. Therefore devils cannot move a body from place to place, 
except it be a body to which they give life. It has been shown, however, and 
is acknowledged that devils do not bestow life on anybody, therefore they 
cannot move human semen locally, that is, from place to place, from body to 
body.
        Moreover, every action is performed by contact, and especially the 
act of generation. But it does not seem possible that there can be any 
contact between the demon and human bodies, since he has not actual point of 
contact with them. Therefore he cannot inject semen into a human body, and 
therefore since this needs a certain bodily action, it would seem that the 
devil cannot accomplish it.
        Besides, devils have no power to move those bodies which in a 
natural order are more closely related to them, for example the heavenly 
bodies, therefore they have no power to move those bodies which are more 
distant and distinct from them. The major is proved, since the power that 
moves and the movement are one and the same thing according to Aristotle in 
his Physics. It follows, therefore, that devils who move heavenly bodies 
must be in heaven, which is wholly untrue, both in our opinion, and in the 
opinion of the Platonists.
        Moreover, S. Augustine, On the Trinity, III, says that devils do 
indeed collect human semen, by means of which they are able to produce 
bodily effects; but this cannot be done without some local movement, 
therefore demons can transfer semen which they have collected and inject it 
into the bodies of others. But, as Walafrid Strabo says in his commentary 
upon Exodus vii, II: And Pharao called the wise men and the magicians: 
Devils go about the earth collecting every sort of seed, and can by working 
upon them broadcast various species. See also the gloss on those words 
(Pharao called). And again in Genesis vi the gloss makes two comments on the 
words: And the sons of God saw the daughters of men. First, that by the sons 
of God are meant the sons of Seth, and by the daughters of men, the 
daughters of Cain. Second, that Giants were created not by some incredibly 
act of men, but by certain devils, which are shameless towards women. For 
the Bible says, Giants were upon the earth. Moreover, even after the Flood 
the bodies not only of men, but also of women, were pre-eminently and 
incredibly beautiful.

        Answer. For the sake of brevity much concerning the power of the 
devil and his works in the matter of the effects of witchcraft is left out; 
for the pious reader either accepts it as proved, or he may, if he wish to 
inquire, find every point clearly elucidated in the second Book of 
Sentences, 5. For hw will see that the devils perform all their works 
consciously and voluntarily; for the nature that was given them has not been 
changed. See Dionysius in his fourth chapter on the subject; their nature 
remained intact and very splendid, although they cannot use it for any good 
purpose.
        And as to their intelligence, he will find that they excel in three 
points of understanding, in their age-long experience, and in the revelation 
of the higher spirits. He will find also how, through the influence of the 
stars, they learn the dominating characteristics of men, and so discover 
that some are more disposed to work witchcraft that others, and that they 
molest these chiefly for the purpose of such works.
        And as to their will, the reader will find that it cleaves 
unchangeably to evil, and that they continuously sin in pride, envy, and 
gross covetousness; and that God, for his own glory, permits them to work 
against His will. He will also understand how with these two qualities of 
intellect and will devils do marvels, so that there is no power in earth 
which can be compared to them: Job xli. There is no power on the earth which 
can be compared with him, who was created that he should fear no one. But 
here the gloss says, Although he fears no one he is yet subject to the 
merits of the Saints.
        He will find also how the devil knows the thoughts of our hearts; 
how he can substantially and disastrously metamorphose bodies with the help 
of an agent; how he can move bodies locally, and alter the outward and inner 
feelings to every conceivable extent; and how he can change the intellect 
and will of a man, however indirectly.
        For although all this is pertinent to our present inquiry, we wish 
only to draw some conclusion therefrom as to that nature of devils, and so 
proceed to the discussion of our question.
        Now the Theologians have ascribed to them certain qualities, as that 
they are unclean spirits, yet not by very nature unclean. For according to 
Dionysius there is in them a natural madness, a rabid concupiscence, a 
wanton fancy, as is seen from their spiritual sins of pride, envy, and 
wrath. For this reason they are the enemies of the human race: rational in 
mind, but reasoning without words; subtle in wickedness, eager to hurt; ever 
fertile in fresh deceptions, they change the perceptions and befoul the 
emotions of men, they confound the watchful, and in dreams disturb the 
sleeping; they bring diseases, stir up tempests, disguise themselves as 
angels of light, bear Hell always about them; from witches they usurp to 
themselves the worship of God, and by this means magic spells are made; they 
seek to get a mastery over the good, and molest them to the most of their 
power; to the elect they are given as a temptation, and always they lie in 
wait for the destruction of men.
        And although they have a thousand ways of doing harm, and have tried 
ever since their downfall to bring about schisms in the Church, to disable 
charity, to infect with the gall of envy the sweetness of the acts of the 
Saints, and in every way to subvert and perturb the human race; yet their 
power remains confined to the privy parts and the navel. See Job xli. For 
through the wantonness of the flesh they have much power over men; and in 
men the source of wantonness lies in the privy parts, since it is from them 
that the semen falls, just as in women it falls from the navel.
        These things, then, being granted for a proper understanding of the 
question of Incubi and Succubi, it must be said that it is just as Catholic 
a view to hold that men may at times be begotten by means of Incubi and 
Succubi, as it is contrary to the words of the Saints and even to the 
tradition of Holy Scripture to maintain the opposite opinion. And this is 
proved as follows. S. Augustine in one place raises this question, not 
indeed as regards witches, but with reference to the very works of devils, 
and to the fables of the poets, and leave the matter in some doubt; though 
later on he is definite in the matter of Holy Scripture. For in his De 
Ciuitate Dei, Book 3, chapter 2, he says: We leave open the question whether 
it was possible for Venus to give birth to Aeneas through coition with 
Anchises. For a similar question arises in the Scriptures, where it is asked 
whether evil angels lay with the daughters of men, and thereby the earth was 
then filled with giants, that is to say, preternaturally big and strong men. 
But he settles the question in Book 5, chapter 23, in these words: It is a 
very general belief, the truth of which is vouched for by many from their 
own experience, or at least from heresay as having been experienced by men 
of undoubted trustworthiness, that Satyrs and Fauns (which are commonly 
called Incubi) have appeared to wanton women and have sought and obtained 
coition with them. And that certain devils (which the Gauls call Dusii) 
assiduously attempt and achieve this filthiness is vouched for by so many 
credible witness that it would seem impudent to deny it.
        Later in the same book he settles the second contention, namely, 
that the passage in Genesis about the sons of God (that is Seth) and the 
daughters of men (that is Cain) does not speak only of Incubi, since the 
existence of such is not credible. In this connexion there is the gloss 
which we have touched upon before. He says that it is not outside belief 
that the Giants of whom the Scripture speaks were begotten not by men, but 
by Angels or certain devils who lust after women. To the same effect is the 
gloss in Esaias xiii, where the prophet foretells the desolation of Babylon, 
and the monsters that should inhabit it. He says: Owls shall dwell there, 
and Satyrs shall dance there. By Satyrs here devils are meant; as the gloss 
says, Satyrs are wild shaggy creatures of the woods, which are a certain 
kind of devils called Incubi. And again in Esaias xxxiv, where he prophesies 
the desolation of the land of the Idumeans because they persecuted the Jews, 
he says: And it shall be an habitation of dragons, and a court for owls. The 
wild beasts also of the desert shall meet . . . The interlinear gloss 
interprets this as monsters and devils. And in the same place Blessed 
Gregory explains these to be woodland gods under another name, not those 
which the Greeks called Pans, and the Latins Incubi.
        Similarly Blessed Isidore, in the last chapter of his 8th book, 
says: Satyrs are they who are called Pans in Greek and Incubi in Latin. And 
they are called Incubi from their practice of overlaying, that is 
debauching. For they often lust lecherously after women, and copulate with 
them; and the Gauls name them Dusii, because they are diligent in this 
beastliness. But the devil which the common people call an Incubus, the 
Romans called a fig Faun; to which Horace said, “O Faunus, love of fleeing 
nymphs, go gently over my lands and smiling fields.”
        
        As to that of S. Paul in I. Corinthians xi, A woman ought to have a 
covering on her head, because of the angels, many Catholics believe that 
“because of the angels” refers to Incubi. Of the same opinion is the 
Venerable Bede in his History of the English; also William of Paris in his 
book De Uniuerso, the last part of the 6th treatise. Moreover, S. Thomas 
speaks of this (I. 25 and II. 8, and elsewhere; also on Esaias xii and xiv). 
Therefore he says that it is rash to deny such things. For that which 
appears true to many cannot be altogether false, according to Aristotle (at 
the end of the De somno et uigilia, and in the 2nd Ethics). I say nothing of 
the many authentic histories, both Catholic and heathen, which openly affirm 
the existence of Incubi.
        But the reason the devils turn themselves into Incubi or Succubi is 
not for the cause of pleasure, since a spirit has not flesh and blood; but 
chiefly it is with this intention, that through the vice of luxury they may 
work a twofold harm against men, that is, in body and in soul, that so men 
may be more given to all vices. And there is no doubt that they know under 
which stars the semen is most vigorous, and that men so conceived will be 
always perverted by witchcraft.
        When Almighty God had enumerated many vice of luxury rife among the 
unbelievers and heretics, from which He wished His people to be clean, He 
says in Leviticus xviii: Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: 
for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you: and 
the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it. The 
gloss explains the word “nations” as meaning devils who, on account of their 
multitude, are call the nations of the world, and rejoice in all sin, 
especially in fornication and idolatry, because by these are defiled the 
body and the soul, and the whole man, which is called “the land.” For every 
sin that a man commits is outside his body, but the man who commits 
fornication sins in his body. If anyone wishes to study further the 
histories concerning Incubi and Succubi, let him read (as has been said) 
Bede in his History of the English, and William, and finally Thomas of 
Brabant in his book About Bees.
        To return to the matter in hand. And first for the natural act of 
propagation instituted by God, that is, between male and female; that as 
though by the permission of God the Sacrament of Matrimony can be made void 
by the work of the devil through witchcraft, as has been shown above. And 
the same is much more strongly true of any other venereal act between man 
and woman.
        But if it is asked why the devil is allowed to case spells upon the 
venereal act, rather than upon any other human act, it is answered that many 
reasons are assigned by the Doctors, which will be discussed later in the 
part concerning the divine permission. For the present that reason that has 
been mentioned before must suffice, namely, that the power of the devil lies 
in the privy parts of men. For of all struggles those are the harder where 
the fight is continuous and victory rare. And it is unsound to argue that in 
that case the work of the devil is stronger than the work of God, since the 
matrimonial act instituted by God can be made void: for the devil does not 
make it void by violence, since he has no power at all in the matter except 
as he is permitted by God. Therefore it would be better to argue from this 
that he is powerless.
        Secondly, it is true that to procreate a man is the act of a living 
body. But when it is said that devils cannot give life, because that flows 
formally from the soul, it is true; but materially life springs from the 
semen, and an Incubus devil can, with God's permission, accomplish this by 
coition. And the semen does not so much spring from him, as it is another 
man's semen received by him for this purpose (see S. Thomas, I. 51, art. 3). 
For the devil is Succubus to a man, and becomes Incubus to a woman. In just 
the same way they absorb the seeds of other things for the generating of 
various thing, as S. Augustine says, de Trinitate 3.
        Now it may be asked, of whom is a child born the son? It is clear 
that he is not the son of the devil, but of the man whose semen was 
received. But when it is urged that, just as in the works of Nature, so 
there is no superfluity in the works of angels, that is granted; but when it 
is inferred that the devil can receive and inject semen invisibly, this also 
is true; but he prefers to perform this visibly as a Succubus and an 
Incubus, that by such filthiness he may infect body and soul of all 
humanity, that is, of both woman and man, there being, as it were, actual 
bodily contact.
        Moreover, devils can do invisibly more things which they are not 
permitted to do visibly, even if the so wished; but they are allowed to do 
them invisibly, either as a trial for the good, or as a punishment for the 
wicked. Finally, it may happen that another devil may take the place of the 
Succubus, receive the semen from him, and become and Incubus in the place of 
the other devil; and this for a threefold reason. Perhaps because one devil, 
allotted to a woman, should receive semen from another devil, allotted to a 
man, that in this way each of them should be commissioned by the prince of 
devils to work some witchcraft; since, to each one is allotted his own 
angel, even from among the evil ones; or because of the filthiness of the 
deed, which one devil would abhor to commit. For in many inquiries it is 
clearly shown that certain devils, out of some nobility in their natures, 
would shrink from a filthy action. Or it may be in order that the Incubus 
may, instead of a man's semen, but interposing himself on to a woman, 
invisibly inject his own semen, that is, that which he has invisibly 
received. And it is not foreign to his nature or power to effect such an 
interposition; since even in bodily form he can interpose himself invisibly 
and without physical contact, as was shown in the case of young man who has 
betrothed to an idol.
        Thirdly, it is said that the power of an angel belongs in an 
infinite degree to the higher things; that is to say, that his power cannot 
be comprehended by the lower orders, but is always superior to them, so that 
it is not limited to one effect only. For the highest powers have most 
unbounded influence over creation. But because he is said to be infinitely 
superior, that is not to say that he is indifferently powerful for any work 
that is propounded for him; for then he might just as well be said to be 
infinitely inferior, as superior.
        But there must be some proportion between the agent and the patient, 
and there can be no proportion between a purely spiritual substance and a 
corporeal one. Therefore not even the devils have any power to cause an 
effect, except through some other active medium. And this is why they use 
the seeds of things to produce their effects; see S. Augustine, de 
Trinitate, 3. Wherefore this argument goes back to the preceding one, and is 
not strengthened by it, unless anyone wishes for S. Augustine's explanation 
why the Intelligences are said to have infinite powers of the higher and not 
of the lower degree, given to them in the order of things corporeal and of 
the celestial bodies, which can influence many and infinite effects. But 
this is not because of the weakness of the inferior powers. And the 
conclusion is that devils, even without assuming bodies, can work 
transmutations in semen; although this is no argument against the present 
proposition, concerning Incubi and Succubi, whose actions they cannot 
perform except by assuming bodily shape, as has been considered above.
        For the fourth argument, that devils cannot move bodies or semen 
locally, which is substantiated by the analogy of the soul. It must be said 
that it is one thing to speak of the spiritual substance of the actual angel 
or devil, and another thing to speak of the actual soul. For the reason why 
the soul cannot locally move a body unless it has given life to it, or else 
by contact of a living body with one that is not living, is this: that the 
soul occupies by far the lowest grade in the order of spiritual beings, and 
therefore it follows that there must be some proportionate relation between 
it and the body which it is able to move by contact. But it is not so with 
devils, whose power altogether exceeds corporeal power.
        And fifthly, it must be said that the contact of a devil with a 
body, either in the way of semen or in any other way, is not a corporeal but 
a virtual contact, and takes place in accordance with the suitable 
proportion of the devil's power. And such bodies are the celestial bodies, 
and even the whole earth or the elements of the world, the power of which we 
may call superior on the authority of S. Thomas in his questions concerning 
Sin (quest. 10, de Daemonibus). For this is either because of the essence of 
nature, or because of condemnation for sin. For there is a due order in 
things, in accordance both with their very nature and with their motion. And 
just as the higher heavenly bodies are moved by the higher spiritual 
substances, as are the good Angels, so are the lower bodies moved by the 
lower spiritual substances, as are the devils. And if this limitation of the 
devils' power is due to the essence of nature, it is held by some that the 
devils are not of the order of those higher angels, but are part of this 
terrestrial order created by God; and this was the opinion of the 
Philosophers. And if it is due to condemnation for sin, as is held by the 
Theologians, then they were thrust from the regions of heaven into this 
lower atmosphere for a punishment, and therefore are not able to move either 
it or the earth.
        This has been said on account of two easily dispelled arguments: - 
One, regarding the heavenly bodies, that the devils could also move these, 
if they were able to move bodies locally, since the stars are neared to them 
in nature, as also the last argument alleges. The answer is that this is not 
valid; for if the former opinion holds good, those bodies exceed the 
proportion of the devils' power: and if the second is true, then again they 
cannot move them, because of their punishment for sin.
        Also there is the argument that objects that the motion of the whole 
and of the part is the same thing, just as Aristotle in his 4th Physics 
instances the case of the whole earth and a clod of soil; and that therefore 
if the devils could move a part of the earth, they could also move the whole 
earth. But this is not valid, as is clear to anyone who examines the 
distinction. But to collect the semen of things and apply it to certain 
effects dos not exceed their natural power, with the permission of God, as 
is self-evident.
        In conclusion, in spite of the contention of some that devils in 
bodily shape can in no way generate children, and that by the “sons of God” 
is meant the descendants of Cain; nevertheless the contrary is clearly 
affirmed by many. And that which seems true to many cannot be altogether 
false, according to Aristotle in his 6th Ethics and at the end of the de 
Somno et Uigilia. And now also in modern times we have the well-attested 
deeds and words of witches who truly and actually perform such things.
        Therefore we make three propositions. First, that the foulest 
venereal acts are performed by such devils, not for the sake of delectation, 
but for the pollution of the souls and bodies of those to whom they act as 
Succubi and Incubi. Second, that through such action complete contraception 
and generation by women can take place, inasmuch as they can deposit human 
semen in the suitable place of a woman's womb where there is already a 
corresponding substance. In the same way they can also collect the seeds of 
other things for the working of their effects. Third, that in the begetting 
of such children only the local motion is to be attributed to devils, and 
not the actual begetting, which arises not from the power of the devil or of 
the body which he assumes, but from the virtue of him whose semen it was; 
wherefore the child is the son not of the devil, but of some man.
        And here there is a clear answer to those who would contend that 
there are two reasons why devils cannot generate children: - First, that 
generation is effected by the formative virtue which exists in semen 
released from a living body; and that because the body assumed by devils is 
not of such a sort, therefore, etc. The answer is clear, that the devil 
deposits naturally formative semen in its proper place, etc. Secondly, it 
may be argued that semen has no power of generation except as long as the 
heat of life is retained in it, and that this must be lost when it is 
carried great distances. The answer is that devils are able to store the 
semen safely, so that its vital heat is not lost; or even that it cannot 
evaporate so easily on account of the great speed at which they move by 
reason of the superiority of the move over the thing moved. 




Question IV  By which Devils are the Operations of Incubus and Succubus 
Practised?  

        Is it Catholic to affirm that the functions of Incubi and Succubi 
belong indifferently and equally to all unclean spirits? And it seems that 
it is so; for to affirm the opposite would be to maintain that there is some 
good order among them. It is argued that just as in the computation of the 
Good there are degrees and orders (see S. Augustine in his book on the 
nature of the Good), so also the computation of the Evil is based upon 
confusion. But as among the good Angels nothing can be without order, so 
among the bad all is disorder, and therefore they all indifferently follows 
these practices. See Job x.: A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of 
the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.
        Again, if they do not all indifferently follow these practices, this 
quality in them comes either from their nature, or from sin, or from 
punishment. But it does not come from their nature, since they are all 
without distinction given to sin, as was set out in the preceding question. 
For they are by nature impure spirits, yet not so unclean as to pejorate 
their good parts; subtle in wickedness, eager to do harm, swollen with 
pride, etc. Therefore these practices in them are due either to sin or to 
punishment. Then again, where the sin is greater, there is the punishment 
greater; and the higher angels sinned more greatly, therefore their 
punishment they have the more to follow these filthy practices. If this is 
not so, another reason will be given why they do not indifferently practise 
these things.
        And again, it is argued that where there is no discipline or 
obedience, there all work without distinction; and it is submitted that 
there is no discipline or obedience among devils, and no agreement. Proverbs 
xiii.: Among the proud there is always contention.
        Again, just as because of sin they will all equally be case into 
Hell after the Day of Judgement, so before that time they are detained in 
the lower mists on account of the duties assigned to them. We do not read 
that there is equality on account of emancipation, therefore neither is 
there equality in the matter of duty and temptation.
        But against this there is the first gloss on I Corinthians xv: As 
long as the world endures Angels are set over Angels, men over men, and 
devils over devils. Also in Job xl it speaks of the scales of Leviathan, 
which signify the members of the devil, how one cleaves to another. 
Therefore there is among them diversity both of order and of action.
        Another question arises, whether or not the devils can be restrained 
by the good Angels from pursuing these foul practices. It must be said that 
the Angels to whose command the adverse Influences are subject are called 
Powers, as S. Gregory says, and S. Augustine (de Trinitate, 3). A rebellious 
and sinful spirit of life is subject to an obedient, pious and just spirit 
of life. And those Creatures which are more perfect and nearer to God have 
authority over the others: for the whole order of preference is originally 
and in the first place in God, and is shared by His creatures according as 
they approach more nearly to Him. Therefore the good Angels, who are nearest 
to God on account of their fruition in Him, which the devils lack, have 
preference over the devils, and rule over them.
        And when it is urged that devils work much harm without any medium, 
or that they are not hindered because they are not subject to good Angels 
who might prevent them; or that if they are so subject, then the evil that 
is done by the subject is due to negligence on the part of the master, and 
there seems to be some negligence among the good Angels: the answer is that 
the Angels are ministers of the Divine wisdom. It follows then that, as the 
Divine wisdom permits certain evil to be done by bad Angels or men, for the 
sake of the good that He draws therefrom, so also the good Angels do not 
altogether prevent wicked men or devils from doing evil.
        Answer. It is Catholic to maintain that there is a certain order of 
interior and exterior actions, and a degree of preference among devils. 
Whence it follows that certain abominations are committed by the lowest 
orders, from which the higher orders are precluded on account of the 
nobility of their natures. And this is generally said to arise from a 
threefold congruity, in that such things harmonize with their nature, with 
the Divine wisdom, and with their own wickedness.
        But more particularly as touching their nature. It is agreed that 
from the beginning of Creation some were always by nature superior, since 
they differ among themselves as to form; and no two Angels are alike in 
form. This follows the more general opinion, which also agrees with the 
words of the Philosophers. Dionysus also lays it down in his tenth chapter 
On the Celestial Hierarchy that in the same order there are three separate 
degrees; and we must agree with this, since they are both immaterial and 
incorporeal. See also S. Thomas (ii. 2). For sin does not take away their 
nature, and the devils after the Fall did not lose their natural gifts, as 
has been said before; and the operations of things follow their natural 
conditions. Therefore both in nature and in operation they are various and 
multiple.
        This harmonizes also with the Divine wisdom; for that which is 
ordained is ordained by God (Romans xiii). And since devils were deputed by 
God for the temptation of men and the punishment of the damned, therefore 
they work upon men from without by many and various means.
        It harmonizes also with their own wickedness. For since they are at 
war with the human race, they fight in an orderly manner; for so they think 
to do greater harm to men, and so they do. Whence it follows that they do 
not share in an equal manner in their most unspeakable abominations.
        And this is more specifically proved as follows. For since, as has 
been said, the operation follows the nature of the thing, it follows also 
that those whose natures are subordinate must in turn be subordinate to 
themselves in operation, just as is the case in corporeal matters. For since 
the lower bodies are by natural ordination below the celestial bodies, and 
their actions and motions are subject to the actions and motions of the 
celestial bodies; and since the devils, as has been said, differ among 
themselves in natural order; therefore they also differ among themselves in 
their natural actions, both extrinsic and instrinsic, and especially in the 
performance of the abominations in question.
        From which it is concluded that since the practice of these 
abominations is for the most part foreign to the nobility of the angelic 
nature, so also in human actions the foulest and beastliest acts are to be 
considered by themselves, and not in relation to the duty of human nature 
and procreation.
        Finally, since some are believed to have fallen from every order, it 
is not unsuitable to maintain that those devils who fell from the lowest 
choir, and even in that held the lowest rank, are deputed to and perform 
these and other abominations.
        Also it must be carefully noted that, though the Scripture speaks of 
Incubi and Succubi lusting after women, yet nowhere do we read that Incubi 
and Succubi fell into vices against nature. We do not speak only of sodomy, 
but of any other sin whereby the act is wrongfully performed outside the 
rightful channel. And the very great enormity of such as sin in this way is 
shown by the fact that all devils equally, of whatsoever order, abominate 
and think shame to commit such actions. And it seems that the gloss on 
Ezekiel xix means this, where it says: I will give thee into the hands of 
the dwellers in Palestine, that is devils, who shall blush at your 
iniquities, meaning vices against nature. And the student will see what 
should be authoritatively understood concerning devils. For no sin has God 
so often punished by the shameful death of multitudes.
        Indeed many say, and it is truly believed, that no one can 
unimperilled persevere in the practice of such vices beyond the period of 
the mortal life of Christ, which lasted for thirty-three years, unless he 
should be saved by some special grace of the Redeemer. And this is proved by 
the fact that there have often been ensnared by this vice octogenarians and 
centenarians, who had up to that time ruled their lives according to the 
discipline of Christ; and, having forsaken Him, they have found the very 
greatest difficulty in obtaining deliverance, and in abandoning themselves 
to such vices.
        Moreover, the names of the devils indicate what order there is among 
them, and what office is assigned to each. For though one and the same name, 
that of devil, is generally used in Scripture because of their various 
qualities, yet the Scriptures teach that One is set over these filthy 
actions, just as certain other vices are subject to Another. For it is the 
practice of Scripture and of speech to name every unclean spirit Diabolus, 
from Dia, that is Two, and Bolus, that is Morsel; for he kills two thing, 
the body and the soul. And this is in accordance with etymology, although in 
Greek Diabolus means shut in Prison, which also is apt, since he is not 
permitted to do as much harm as he wishes. Or Diabolus may mean Downflowing, 
since he flowed down, that is, fell down, both specifically and locally. He 
is also named Demon, that is, Cunning over Blood, since he thirsts for and 
procures sin with a threefold knowledge, being powerful in the subtlety of 
his nature, in his age-long experience, and in the revelation of the good 
spirits. He is called also Belial, which means Without Yoke or Master; for 
he can fight against him to whom he should be subject. He is called also 
Beelzebub, which means Lord of Flies, that is, of the souls of sinners who 
have left the true faith of Christ. Also Satan, that is, the Adversary; see 
I S. Peter ii: For your adversary the devil goeth about, etc. Also Behemoth, 
that is, Beast, because he makes men bestial.
        But the very devil of Fornication, and the chief of that 
abomination, is called Asmodeus, which means the Creature of Judgement: for 
because of this kind of sin a terrible judgement was executed upon Sodom and 
the four other cities. Similarly the devil of Pride is called Leviathan, 
which means Their Addition; because when Lucifer tempted our first parents 
he promised them, out of his pride, the addition of Divinity. Concerning him 
the Lord said through Esaias: I shall visit it upon Leviathan, that old and 
tortuous serpent. And the devil of Avarice and Riches is called Mammon, whom 
also Christ mentions in the Gospel (S. Matthew vi): Ye cannot serve God, 
etc.
        To the arguments. First, that good can be found without evil, but 
evil cannot be found without good; for it is poured upon a creature that is 
good in itself. And therefore the devils, in so far as they have a good 
nature, were ordained in the course of nature; and for their actions see Job 
x.
        Secondly, it can be said that the devils deputed to work are not in 
Hell, but in the lower mists. And they have here an order among themselves, 
which they will not have in Hell. From which it may be said that all order 
ceased among them, as touching the attainment of blessedness, at that time 
when they fell irrecoverably from such rank. And it may be said that even in 
Hell there will be among them a gradation of power, and of the affliction of 
punishments, inasmuch as some, and not others, will be deputed to torment 
the souls. But this gradation will come rather from God than from 
themselves, as will also their torments.
        Thirdly, when it is said that the higher devils, because they sinned 
the more, are the more punished, and must therefore be the more bound to the 
commission of these filthy acts, it is answered that sin bears relation to 
punishment, and not to the act or operation of nature; and therefore it is 
by reason of their nobility of nature that these are not given to such 
filthiness, and it has nothing to do with their sin or punishment. And 
though they are all impure spirits, and eager to do harm, yet one is more so 
than another, in proportion as their natures are the further thrust into 
darkness.
        Fourthly, it is said that there is agreement among devils, but of 
wickedness rather than friendship, in that they hate mankind, and strive 
their utmost against justice. For such agreement is found among the wicked, 
that they band themselves together, and depute those whose talents seem 
suitable to the pursuit of particular iniquities.
        Fifthly, although imprisonment is equally decreed for all, now in 
the lower atmosphere and afterwards in Hell, yet not therefore are equal 
penalties and duties equally ordained for them: for the nobler they are in 
nature and the more potent in office, the heavier is the torment to which 
they are subjected. See Wisdom vi: “The powerful shall powerfully suffer 
torments.” 




Question V  What is the Source of the Increase of Works of Witchcraft? 
Whence comes it that the Practice of Witchcraft hath so notably increased?  

        Is it in any way a Catholic opinion to hold that the origin and 
growth of witchcraft proceed from the influence of the celestial bodies; or 
from the abundant wickedness of men, and not from the abominations of Incubi 
and Succubi? And it seems that it springs from man's own wickedness. For S. 
Augustine says, in Book LXXXIII, that the cause of a man's depravity lies in 
his own will, whether he sins at his own or at another's suggestion. But a 
witch is depraved through sin, therefore the cause of it is not the devil 
but human will. In the same place he speaks of free-will, that everyone is 
the cause of his own wickedness. And he reasons thus: that the sin of man 
proceeds from free-will, but the devil cannot destroy free-will, for this 
would militate against liberty: therefore the devil cannot be the cause of 
that or any other sin. Again, in the book of Ecclesiastic Dogma it is said: 
Not all our evil thoughts are stirred up by the devil, but sometimes they 
arise from the operation of our own judgement.
        Again, if the stars were not the cause of human actions both good 
and bad, Astrologers would not so frequently foretell the truth about the 
result of wars and other human acts: therefore they are in some way a cause.
        Again, the stars influence the devils themselves in the causing of 
certain spells; and therefore they can all the more influence men. Three 
proofs are adduced for this assumption. For certain men who are called 
Lunatics are molested by devils more at one time than at another; and the 
devils would not so behave, but would rather molest them at all times, 
unless they themselves were deeply affected by certain phases of the Moon. 
It is proved again from the fact the Necromancers observe certain 
constellations for the invoking of devils, which they would not do unless 
they knew that those devils were subject to the stars.
        And this is also adduced as a proof; that according to S. Augustine 
(de Ciuitate Dei, 10), the devils employ certain lower bodies, such as 
herbs, stones, animals, and certain sounds and voices, and figures. But 
since the heavenly bodies are of more potency than the lower bodies, 
therefore the stars are a far greater influence than these things. And 
witches are the more in subjection in that their deeds proceed from the 
influence of those bodies, and not from the help of evil spirits. And the 
argument is supported from I Kings xvi, where Saul was vexed by a devil, but 
was calmed when David struck his harp before him, and the evil departed.
        But against this. It is impossible to produce an effect without its 
cause; and the deeds of witches are such that they cannot be done without 
the help of devils, as is shown by the description of witches in S. Isidore, 
Ethics VIII. WItches are so called from the enormity of their magic spells; 
for they disturb the elements and confound the minds of men, and without any 
venomous draught, but merely by virtue of incantations, destroy souls, etc. 
But this sort of effects cannot be caused by the influence of the stars 
through the agency of a man.
        Besides, Aristotle says in his Ethics that it is difficult to know 
what is the beginning of the operation of thought, and shows that it must be 
something extrinsic. For everything that begins from a beginning has some 
cause. Now a man begins to do that which he wills; and he begins to will 
because of some pre-suggestion; and if this is some precedent suggestion, it 
must either proceed from the infinite, or there is some extrinsic beginning 
which first brings a suggestion to a man. Unless indeed it be argued that 
this is a matter of chance, from which it would follow that all human 
actions are fortuitous, which is absurd. Therefore the beginning of good in 
the good is said to be God, Who is not the cause of sin. But for the wicked, 
when a man begins to be influenced towards and wills to commit sin, there 
must also be some extrinsic cause of this. And this can be no other than the 
devil; especially in the case of witches, as is shown above, for the stars 
cannot influence such acts. Therefore the truth is plain.
        Moreover, that which has power over the motive has also power over 
the result which is caused by the motive. Now the motive of the will is 
something perceived through the sense or the intellect, both of which are 
subject to the power of the devil. For S. Augustine says in Book 83: This 
evil, which is of the devil, creeps in by all the sensual approaches; he 
places himself in figures, he adapts himself to colours, he attaches himself 
to sounds, he lurks in angry and wrongful conversation, he abides in smells, 
he impregnates with flavours and fills with certain exhalations all the 
channels of the understanding. Therefore it is seen that it is in the 
devil's power to influence the will, which is directly the cause of sin.
        Besides, everything which has a choice of two ways needs some 
determining factor before it proceeds to the action. And the free-will of 
man has the choice between good and ill; therefore when he embarks upon sin, 
it needs that he is determined by something towards ill. And this seems 
chiefly to be done by the devil, especially in the actions of witches, whose 
will is made up for evil. Therefore it seems that the evil will of the devil 
is the cause of evil will in man, especially in witches. And the argument 
may be substantiated thus; that just as a good Angel cleaves to good, so 
does a bad Angel to evil; but the former leads a man into goodness, 
therefore the latter leads him into evil. For it is, says Dionysius, the 
unalterable and fixed law of divinity, that the lowest has it cause in the 
highest.
        Answer. Such as contend that witchcraft has its origin in the 
influence of the stars stand convicted of three errors. In the first place, 
it is not possible that it originated from astromancers and casters of 
horoscopes and fortune-tellers. For if it is asked whether the vice of 
witchcraft in men is caused by the influence of the stars, then, in 
consideration of the variety of men's characters, and for the upholding of 
the true faith, a distinction must be maintained; namely, that there are two 
ways in which it can be understood that men's characters can be caused by 
the stars. Either completely and of necessity, or by disposition and 
contingency. And as for the first, it is not only false, but so heretical 
and contrary to the Christian religion, that the true faith cannot be 
maintained in such an error. For this reason, he who argues that everything 
of necessity proceeds from the stars takes away all merit and, in 
consequence, all blame: also he takes away Grace, and therefore Glory. For 
uprightness of character suffers prejudice by this error, since the blame of 
the sinner redounds upon the stars, licence to sin without culpability is 
conceded, and man is committed to the worship and adoration of the stars.
        But as for the contention that men's characters are conditionally 
varied by the disposition of the stars, it is so far true that is it not 
contrary to reason or faith. For it is obvious that the disposition of a 
body variously causes many variations in the humours and character of the 
soul; for generally the soul imitates the complexions of the body, as it 
said in the Six Principles. Wherefore the choleric are wrathful, the 
sanguine are kindly, the melancholy are envious, and the phlegmatic are 
slothful. But this is not absolute; for the soul is master of its body, 
especially when it is helped by Grace. And we see many choleric who are 
gently, and melancholy who are kindly. Therefore when the virtue of the 
stars influences the formation and quality of a man's humours, it is agreed 
that they have some influence over the character, but very distantly: for 
the virtue of the lower nature has more effect on the quality of the humours 
than has the virtue of the stars.
        Wherefore S. Augustine (de Ciuitate Dei, V), where he resolves a 
certain question of two brothers who fell ill and were cured simultaneously, 
approves the reasoning of Hippocrates rather than that of an Astronomer. For 
Hippocrates answered that it is owing to the similarity of their humours; 
and the Astronomer answered that it was owing the identity of their 
horoscopes. For the Physician's answer was better, since he adduced the more 
powerful and immediate cause. Thus, therefore, it must be said that the 
influence of the stars is to some degree conducive to the wickedness of 
witches, if it be granted that there is any such influence over the bodies 
that predisposes them to this manner of abomination rather than to any other 
sort of works either vicious or virtuous: but this disposition must not be 
said to be necessary, immediate, and sufficient, but remote and contingent.
        Neither is that objection valid which is based on the book of the 
Philosophers on the properties of the elements, where it says that kingdoms 
are emptied and lands depopulated at the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn; 
and it is argued from this that such things are to be understood as being 
outside the free-will of men, and that therefore the influence of the stars 
has power over free-will. For it is answered that in this saying the 
Philosopher does not mean to imply that men cannot resist the influence of 
that constellation towards dissensions, but that they will not. For Ptolemy 
in Almagest says: A wise man will be the master of the stars. For although, 
since Saturn has a melancholy and bad influence and Jupiter a very good 
influence, the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn can dispose men to quarrels 
and discords; yet, through free-will, men can resist that inclination, and 
very easily with the help of God's grace.
        And again it is no valid objection to quote S. John Damascene where 
he says (Book II, chap. vi) that comets are often the sign of the death of 
kings. For it will be answered that even if we follow the opinion of S. John 
Damascene, which was, as is evident in the book referred to, contrary to the 
opinion of the Philosophic Way, yet this is no proof of the inevitability of 
human actions. For S. John considers that a comet is not a natural creation, 
nor is it one of the stars set in the firmament; wherefore neither its 
significance nor influence is natural. For he says that comets are not of 
the stars which were created in the beginning, but that they are made for a 
particular occasion, and then dissolved, by Divine command. This then is the 
opinion of S. John Damascene. But God by such a sign foretells the death of 
kings rather than of other men, both because from this may arise the 
confusion of a kingdom. And the Angels are more careful to watch over kings 
for the general good; and kings are born and die under the ministry of 
Angels.
        And there is no difficulty in the opinion of the Philosophers, who 
say that a comet is a hot and dry conglomeration, generated in the higher 
part of space near the fire, and that a conjoined globe of that hot and dry 
vapour assumes the likeness of a star. But unincorporated parts of that 
vapour stretch in long extremities joined to that globe, and are a sort of 
adjunct to it. And according to this view, not of itself but by accident, it 
predicts death which proceeds from hot and dry infirmities. And since for 
the most part the rich are fed on things of a hot and dry nature, therefore 
at such times many of the rich die; among which the death of kings and 
princes is the most notable. And this view is not far from the view of S. 
John Damascene, when carefully considered, except as regards the operation 
and co-operation of the Angels, which not even the philosophers can ignore. 
For indeed when the vapours in their dryness and heat have nothing to do 
with the generation of a comet, even then, for reasons already set out, a 
comet may be formed by the operation of an Angel.
        In this way the star which portended the death of the learned S. 
Thomas was not one of the stars set in the firmament, but was formed by an 
Angel from some convenient material, and, having performed it office, was 
again dissolved.
        From this we see that, whichever of those opinions we follow, the 
stars have no inherent influence over the free-will, or, consequently, over 
the malice and character of men.
        It is to be noted also that Astronomers often foretell the truth, 
and that their judgements are for the most part effective on one province or 
one nation. And the reason is that they take their judgements from the 
stars, which, according to the more probable view, have a greater, though 
not an inevitable, influence over the actions of mankind in general, that 
is, over one nation or province, than over one individual person; and this 
because the greater part of one nation more closely obeys the natural 
disposition of the body than does one single man. But this is mentioned 
incidentally.
        And the second of the three ways by which we vindicate the Catholic 
standpoint is by refuting the errors of those who cast Horoscopes and 
Mathematicians who worship the goddess of fortune. Of these S. Isidore 
(Ethics, VIII. 9) says that those who cast Horoscopes are so called from 
their examination of the stars at nativity, and are commonly called 
Mathematicians; and in the same Book, chapter 2, he says that Fortune has 
her name from fortuitousness. and is a sort of goddess who mocks human 
affairs in a haphazard and fortuitous manner. Wherefore she is called blind, 
since she runs here and there with no consideration for desert, and comes 
indifferently to good and bad. So much for Isidore. But to believe that 
there is such a goddess, or that the harm done to bodies and creatures which 
is ascribed to witchcraft does not actually proceed from witchcraft, but 
from that same goddess of Fortune, is sheer idolatry: and also to assert 
that witches themselves were born for that very purpose that they might 
perform such deeds in the world is similarly alien to the Faith, and indeed 
to the general teaching of the Philosophers. Anyone who pleases may refer to 
S. Thomas in the 3rd book of his Summa of the Faith against the Gentiles. 
question 87, etc., and he will find much to this effect.
        Nevertheless one point must not be omitted, for the sake of those 
who perhaps have not great quantity of books. It is there noted that three 
things are to be considered in man, which are directed by three celestial 
causes, namely, the act of the will, the act of the intellect, and the act 
of the body. The first of these is governed directly and soley by God, the 
second by an Angel, and the third by a celestial body. For choice and will 
are directly governed by God for good works, as the Scripture says in 
Proverbs xxi: The heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord; he turneth 
it whithersoever he will. And it says “the heart of the king” to signify 
that, as the great cannot oppose His will, so are others even less able to 
do so. Also S. Paul says: God who causeth us to wish and to perform that 
which is good.

        The human understanding is governed by God through the mediation of 
an Angel. And those bodily actions, either exterior or interior, which are 
natural to man, are regulated by God through the mediation of the Angels and 
the celestial bodies. For blessed Dionysius (de Diuin. nom., IV) says that 
the celestial bodies are the causes of that which happens in this world; 
though he makes no implication of fatality.
        And since man is governed as to his body by the celestial bodies, as 
to his intellect by the Angels, and as to his will by God, it may happen 
that if he rejects God's inspiration towards goodness, and the guidance of 
his bodily affections to those things toward which the influence of the 
stars inclines him, that so his will and understanding become entangled in 
malice and error.
        However, it is not possible for anyone to be influenced by the stars 
to enter upon that sort of error in which the witches are ensnared, such as 
bloodshed, theft or robbery, or even the perpetration of the worst 
incontinences; and this is true of other natural phenomena.
        Also, as William of Paris says in his De Universo, it is proved by 
experience that if a harlot tries to plant an olive it does not become 
fruitful, whereas if it is planted by a chaste woman it is fruitful. And a 
doctor in healing, a farmer in planting, or a soldier in fighting can do 
more with the help of the influence of the stars than another who possesses 
the same skill can do.
        Our third way is taken from the refutation of the belief in Fate. 
And here it is to be noted that a belief in Fate is in one way quite 
Catholic, but in another way entirely heretical. For Fate may be understood 
after the manner of certain Gentiles and Mathematicians, who thought that 
the different characters of men were inevitably caused by the force of the 
position of the stars, so that a wizard was predestined to be such, even if 
he were of a good character, because the disposition of the stars under 
which he was conceived or born caused him to be such as he was. And that 
force they called by the name of Fate.
        But that opinion is not only false, but heretical and altogether 
detestable on account of the deprivation which it must entail, as was shown 
above in the refutation of the first error. For by it would be removed all 
reason for merit or blame, for grace and glory, and God would be made the 
author of our evil, and more such incongruities. Therefore such conception 
of Fate must be altogether rejected, since there is no such thing. And 
touching this belief S. Gregory says in his Homily on the Epiphany: Far be 
it from the hearts of the faithful to say that there is any Fate.
        And although, on account of the same incongruity which is detected 
in both, this opinion may seem to be the same as that concerning the 
Astrologers, they are yet different inasmuch as they disagree concerning the 
force of the stars and the influx of the seven Planets.
        But Fate may be considered to be a sort of second disposition, or an 
ordination of second causes for the production of foreseen Divine effects. 
And in this way Fate is truly something. For the providence of God 
accomplishes His effects through mediating cause, in such matters are 
subject to second causes; though this is not so in the case of some other 
matters, such as the creation of souls, glorification, and the acquisition 
of grace.
        Also the Angels may co-operate in the infusion of Grace by 
enlightening and guiding the understanding and the capability of the will, 
and so a certain arrangement of results may be said to be one and the same 
of Providence or even Fate. For it is considered in this way; that there is 
in God a quality which may be called Providence, or it may be said that He 
has ordained intermediary causes for the realization of some of His 
purposes; and to this extent Fate is a rational fact. And in this way 
Boethius speaks of Fate (de Consolatione IV): Fate is an inherent 
disposition in things mobile, by which Providence binds things to that which 
It has ordained.
        Nevertheless the learned Saints refused to use this name, on account 
of those who twisted its meaning to force of the position of the stars. 
Wherefore S. Augustine (de Ciuitate Dei, V) says: If anyone attributed human 
affairs to Fate, meaning by Fate the Will and Power of God, let him keep his 
opinion but amend his tongue.
        It is clear, then, that what has been said provides a sufficient 
answer to the question whether all things, including works of witchcraft, 
are subject to Fate. For if Fate is said to be the ordainment of second 
cause of foreseen Divine results, that is, when God wills to effect His 
purposes through second causes; to that extent they are subject to Fate, 
that is, to second causes so ordained by God; and the influence of the stars 
is one of these second causes. But those things which come directly from 
God, such as the Creation of things, the Glorification of things substantial 
and spiritual, and other things of this sort, are not subject to such Fate. 
And Boethius, in the book we have quoted, supports this view when he says 
that those things which are near to the primal Deity are beyond the 
influence of the decrees of Fate. Therefore the works of witches, being 
outside the common cause and order of nature, are not subject to these 
second causes. That is to say, that as regards their origin they are not 
subject to willy-nilly Fate, but to other causes. 

Witchcraft is not caused by the Powers that Move the Stars 

        It follows that, just as witchcraft cannot be caused in the manner 
that has been suggested, so also it is not caused by the separate Essences 
which are the Powers that move the stars; although this was believed to be 
the case by Avicenna and his school, for the following reasons. For they 
argued those are separate Essences of a higher power than our souls; and the 
soul itself can sometimes, by the force of imagination, or merely through 
fear, effect a change in its own body. For example, a man walking on a plank 
place at a great height easily falls, but in his fear he imagines that he 
will fall; but if the plank were placed on the ground he would not fall, for 
he would have no reason to fear falling. So by the mere apprehension of the 
soul the body grows hot in the case of the concupiscent and wrathful, and 
cold in the case of the fearful. It can also, by strongly imagining and 
fearing such things, be affected with illnesses, such as fever and leprosy. 
And as with its own body, so it can influence another body either for health 
or sickness; and to this is ascribed the cause of bewitchment, of which we 
have spoken above.
        And since according to that view the deeds of witches have to be 
attributed to the Powers that move the stars, if not precisely to the stars 
themselves; therefore we must add to what we have already said on this 
subject, that this also is impossible. For the Powers that move the stars 
are good and intelligent Essences, not only by nature but also by will, as 
appears from their working for the good of the whole universe. But that 
creature by whose aid witchcraft is done, although it may be good in nature, 
cannot be good by will. Therefore it is impossible to hold the same 
judgement of both these Essences.
        And that such an Essence cannot be good in respect of will is proved 
as follows. For it is no part of a well-disposed intelligence to extend 
patronage to those who act against virtue; and of such sort are the actions 
of witches. For it will be shown in the Second Part that they commit 
murders, fornications, and sacrifices of children and animals, and for their 
evil deeds are called witches. Therefore the Intelligence by whose aid such 
witchcraft is performed cannot be well-disposed towards virtue; although it 
may be good in its original nature, since all things are so, as is evident 
to anyone who thinks about it. Also it is no part of a good Intelligence to 
be the familiar spirit of criminals, and to extend patronage to them and not 
to the virtuous. For they are criminals who use witchcraft, and they are 
known by their works.
        Now the natural function of the Essences that move the stars is to 
influence any creature for good, although it often happens that it becomes 
corrupted by come accident. Therefore those Essences cannot be the original 
cause of witches.
        Besides, it is the part of a good spirit to lead men to that which 
is good in human nature, and of good repute; therefore to entice men away 
from such, and to betray them into evil things, belongs to an evilly-
disposed spirit. And by the wiles of such a spirit men make no headway in 
those things which are worthy, such as the sciences and virtues, but rather 
in that which is evil, such as the knowledge of theft and a thousand other 
crimes; therefore the origin is not in these separate Essences, but in some 
Power evilly disposed toward virtue.
        Besides, that cannot be understood to be a well-disposed spirit in 
the commission of crimes. But this is what happens in the deeds of witches; 
for, as will be shown by their performances, they abjure the Faith, and slay 
innocent children. For the separate Essences which move the stars do not, on 
account of their goodness, provide help in these works if witchcraft.
        In conclusion, then; this kind of works can no more arise from the 
Movers of the stars than from the stars themselves. And since they must 
originate from some Power allied to some creature, and that Power cannot be 
good in its will, although it may be naturally good, and that the devils 
themselves answer to this description, it follows that it is by their power 
that such things are done.
        Unless, indeed, anyone should bring forward the trifling objection 
that witchcraft originates in human malice, and that it is effected by 
curses, and the placings of images in a certain place, the stars being 
favourable. For example, a certain witch placed her image and said to a 
woman, “I will make you blind and lame”; and it happened so. But it happened 
because the woman from her nativity was destined by the stars for such an 
affliction; and if such words and practices had been used against anyone 
else, they would not have been effective. And to this I shall answer in 
detail; first, that such witchcrafts cannot be caused by human malice; 
secondly, that they cannot be caused by magic words or images, whatever 
stars may be in concurrence. 

Witchcraft does not operate from Human Malice alone. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----
        And first to prove that witches' works cannot arise from human 
malice, however great. For a man's malice may be either habitual, inasmuch 
as by frequent practice he acquires a habit that inclines him to commit sin, 
not from ignorance but from weakness; in which case he is held to sin from 
wickedness. Or it may be actual malice, by which is meant the deliberate 
choice of evil, which is called the sin against the Holy Ghost. But in 
neither case can he, without the help of some higher Power, work such spells 
as the mutation of the elements, or the harming of the bodies both of men 
and beasts. And this is proved first as to the cause, and secondly as to the 
effect of witchcraft.
        For a man cannot effect such works without malice, that is, a 
weakening of his nature, and still less when his nature has already been 
weakened; as is clear, since his active virtue is already diminished. But 
man, through all sorts of sin and wickedness, becomes weakened in his 
natural goodness. Both reason and authority prove this. For Dionysius (de 
Diuin. Nom. IV) says: Sin is the effect of natural habit; and he speaks of 
the sin of guilt. Wherefore no one who is conscious of sin commits it, 
unless he does so out of deliberate revolt.
        I answer thus. The sin of guilt stands in the same relation to the 
good of nature as does the good of grace to the sin of nature. But by grace 
is diminished natural sin, which is as a tinder prone to guilt; therefore 
much more is natural good diminished by guilt. And it is not valid to put 
forward the objection that a bewitchment is sometimes caused by an old woman 
evilly looking at a child, by which the child is changed and bewitched. For, 
as has already been shown, this can only happen to children because of their 
tender complexion. But here we speak of the bodies of all sorts of men and 
beasts, and even the elements and hailstorms. If anyone wishes to inquire 
further, he may refer to S. Thomas in his questions concerning Evil: Whether 
sin can corrupt the whole natural good, etc.
        And now as regards the effects of witchcraft. From the effects we 
arrive at a knowledge of the cause. Now these effects, as they concerns us, 
are outside the order of created nature as known to us, and are done through 
the power of some creature unknown to us, although they are not miracles, 
which are things done outside the order of the whole of created nature. As 
for miracles, they are wrought by His power Who is above the whole order of 
the entire natural creation, Which is the Blessed God; as it is said: Thou 
are He Who alone workest great marvels. So also the works of witches are 
said to be miraculous only inasmuch as they are done by some cause unknown 
to us, and outside the order of created nature as known to us. From which it 
follows that the corporeal virtue of a man cannot extend itself to the 
causation of such works; for it has always this quality, that the cause with 
the natural effect is, in the case of man, recognized naturally and without 
wonder.
        And that the works of witches can in some way be called miraculous, 
in so far as they exceed human knowledge, is clear from their very nature; 
for they are not done naturally. It is shown also by all the Doctors, 
especially S. Augustine in Book LXXXIII, where he says that by magic arts 
many miracles are wrought similar to those miracles which are done by the 
servants of God. And again in the same book he says that Magicians do 
miracles by private contract, good Christians by public justice, and bad 
Christians by the signs of public justice. And all this is explained as 
follows. For there is a Divine justice in the whole universe, just as there 
is a public law in the State. But the virtue of any creature has to do with 
the universe ,as that of the private individual has to do with the State. 
Therefore inasmuch as good Christians work miracles by Divine justice, they 
are said to work them by public justice. But the Magician, since he works 
through a pact entered into with the devil, is said to work by private 
contract; for he works by means of the devil, who by his natural power can 
do things outside the order of created nature as known to us, through the 
virtue of a creature unknown to us, and it will be for us a miracle, 
although not actually so, since he cannot work outside of the whole of 
created nature, and through all the virtues of creatures unknown to us. For 
in this way only God is said to work miracles. As it said: Thou are God Who 
alone workest great marvels. But bad Christians work through the signs of 
public justice, as by invoking the Name of Christ, or by exhibiting certain 
sacraments. If anyone pleases, he can refer to S. Thomas in the first part 
of the questions, III, art. 4. He can also study the conclusions in the 
Second Part of this work, Chapter VI. 

That Witchcraft is not exercised and wrought by Voices and Words under a 
favouring Influence of the Stars. 

        Neither does witchcraft proceed from words uttered over images by 
men under favourable constellations. For the intellect of a man is of such a 
nature that its knowledge springs from things, and phantasms must be 
rationally examined. It is not in his nature, simply by though or by the 
instrinsic operation of his intellect, to cause things to happen just be 
expressing them in words. For if there were men who had such power, they 
would not be of the same nature as we, and could only equivocally be called 
men.
        But it is said that they effect these things by words when the stars 
of the nativity are favourable; from which it would follow that they would 
be able to act by the power of words only under certain conditions, and that 
they would be powerless without the help of the stars of their victim's 
nativity. But this is clearly false from what has been said before 
concerning Astromancers, casters of Horoscopes and Fortune-tellers.
        Besides, words express the conception of the mind; and the stars 
cannot influence the understanding, neither can the Powers that move them, 
unless they wish on their own account, and apart from the motion of the 
stars, to enlighten the understanding; and this would only happen in regard 
to good works, for not enlightenment but darkness is given to the 
understanding for the performance of evil works; and such is the function 
not of good, but of evil spirits. Therefore it is clear that if their words 
are in any way effective, it is not by virtue of any star, but by virtue of 
some Intelligence, which may be naturally good, but cannot be good in 
respect of will, since it always works for evil; and such is the devil, as 
has been shown above.
        Again, it has been shown above that there are two kinds of images. 
Those of the Astrologers and Mages are ordained not for corruption, but for 
the obtaining of some private good. But the images of witches are quite 
different, since always they are secretly placed somewhere by the command of 
the devil for the hurt of the creature; and they who walk or sleep over them 
are harmed, as the witches themselves confess. Wherefore whatever they 
effect is done by means of devils, and is not due to the influence of the 
stars.
        To the arguments. For the first, we must understand the words of S. 
Augustine, that the cause of man's depravity lies in man's will, meaning the 
cause which produces the effect; which is properly said to be the cause. It 
is not so, however, with the cause which permits the effect, or arranges or 
advises or suggests it, in which sense the devil is said to be the cause of 
sin and depravity; God only permitting it that good may come of evil. As S. 
Augustine says: The devil provides the inner suggestion, and persuades both 
inwardly and outwardly by more active stimulation. But he instructs those 
who are entirely in his power, as are witches, whom there is no need to 
tempt from within, but only from without, etc.
        And through this we come to the second argument, that everyone is, 
by direct understanding, the cause of his own wickedness. And concerning 
this it is to be said that, though it would be contrary to the doctrine of 
free-will to believe that a man may be influenced by direct command, it is 
not to say that he is influenced by suggestion.
        Thirdly, impulses to good or evil can be caused to be suggested by 
the influence of the stars, and the impulse is received as a natural 
inclination to human virtue or vice. But the works of witches are outside 
the common order of nature, and therefore they cannot be subject to those 
influences.
        The fourth argument is equally clear. For though the stars are a 
cause of human acts, witchcraft is not properly a human act.
        For the fifth argument, that the Powers that move the stars can 
influence souls. If that is understood directly, they do so influence them 
by enlightening them towards goodness, but not to witchcraft, as has been 
shown above. But if it is understood mediately, then through the medium of 
the stars they exert an indirect and suggestive influence.
        Sixthly, there are two reasons why devils molest men at certain 
phases of the Moon. First, that they may bring disrepute on a creature of 
God, namely, the Moon, as S. Jerome and S. John Chrysostom say. Secondly, 
because they cannot, as has been said above, operate except through the 
medium of the natural powers. Therefore they study the aptitudes of bodies 
for receiving an impression; and because, as Aristotle says, the brain is 
the most humid of all the parts of the body, therefore it chiefly is subject 
to the operation of the Moon, which itself has power to incite humours. 
Moreover, the animal forces are perfected in the brain, and therefore the 
devils disturb a man's fancy according to certain phases of the Moon, when 
the brain is ripe for such influences.
        And there are two reasons why the devils are present as counsellors 
in certain constellations. First, that they may lead men into the error of 
thinking that there is some divinity in the stars. Secondly, because they 
think that under the influence of some constellations corporeal matter is 
more apt for the deeds that they counsel.
        And as to what S. Augustine says in de Ciuitate Dei, XXXVI: Devils 
are attracted by various kinds of stones, herbs, trees, animals, songs, and 
instruments of music, not as animals are attracted by food, but as spirits 
by signs, as if these things were exhibited to them as a sign of Divine 
honour, for which they are themselves eager.
        But it is often objected that devils can be hindered by herbs and 
music from molesting men; as it is alleged in the argument from Saul and the 
music of the harp. And hence an attempt is made to argue that some men can 
work witchcraft through certain herbs and occult causes, without the help of 
devils, buy only of the influence of the stars, which have more direct power 
over matter corporeal for corporeal effects than over the devils for effects 
of witchcraft.
        Now, though this must be answered more widely, it is to be noted 
that herbs and music cannot by their own natural virtue entirely shut out 
the molestation which the devil can inflict upon men, with the permission of 
God and the Angels. Yet they can mitigate that molestation; and this can 
even be of so slight a nature that they can entirely remove it. But they 
would do this, not by acting against the devil himself, since he is a 
separate spirit against whom nothing corporeal can naturally act, but by 
acting against the actual molestation of the devil. For every cause that has 
limited power can produce a more intense effect on a suitable than upon an 
unsuitable material. See Aristotle De Anima. They who act do so upon a 
predisposed patient. Now the devil is an agent of limited power; therefore 
he can inflict a fiercer affliction on a man disposed to that affliction or 
to that which the devil means to inflict, than upon a man of a contrary 
disposition. For example, the devil can induce a fiercer passion of 
melancholy in a man disposed to that humour than in a man of the contrary 
disposition.
        Moreover, it is certain that herbs and music can change the 
disposition of the body, and consequently if the emotions. This is evident 
in the case of herbs, since some incline a man to joy, some to sadness, and 
so with others. It is evident also in the case of music, as Aristotle shows 
(Politics, VIII), where he says that different harmonies can produce 
different passions in a man. Boethius also mentions this in his Music, and 
the author of the Birth of Knowledge, where he speaks of the usefulness of 
music, and says that it is of value in the cure or alleviation of various 
infirmities. And thus, other things being equal, it may help to weaken the 
affliction.
        But I do not see how herbs or music can cause a man to be of such a 
disposition that he can in no way be molested by the devil. Even if such a 
thing were permissible, the devil, moving only in local vapour of the 
spirit, can grievously affect men supernaturally. But herbs and harmonies 
cannot of their own natural virtue cause in man a disposition by which the 
devil is prevented from creating the aforesaid commotion. Nevertheless it 
sometimes happens that the devil is permitted to inflict only so small a 
vexation on a man that, through some strong contrary disposition, it may be 
totally removed; and then some herbs or harmonies can so dispose a man's 
body to the contrary that the vexation is totally removed. For example, the 
devil may at times vex a man with the affliction of sadness; but so weakly 
that herbs or harmonies which are capable of causing a swelling and 
uplifting of the spirits, which are contrary emotions to sadness, can 
totally remove that sadness.
        Moreover, S. Augustine, in his Second Book On the Christian 
Doctrine, condemns amulets and certain other things of which he there writes 
much, attributing their virtue to magic art, since thy can have no natural 
virtue of their own. And this is clear from what he says. To this sort 
belong all amulets and charms which are condemned by the School of 
Physicians, which condemns very clearly their use, in that they have no 
efficacy of their own natural virtue.
        And as for that concerning I Kings xvi: that Saul, who was vexed by 
a devil, was alleviated when David played his harp before him, and that the 
devil departed, etc. It must be known that it is quite true that by the 
playing of the harp, and the natural virtue of that harmony, the affliction 
of Saul was to some extent relieved, inasmuch as that music did somewhat 
calm hs sense through hearing; through which calming he was made less prone 
to that vexation. But the reason why the evil spirit departed when David 
played the harp was because of the might of the Cross, which is clearly 
enough shown by the gloss, where it says: David was learned in music, 
skilful in the different notes and harmonic modulations. He shows the 
essential unity by playing each day in various modes. David repressed the 
evil spirit by the harp, not because there was so much virtue in the harp, 
but it was made in the sign of a cross, being a cross of wood with the 
strings stretched across it. And even at that time the devils fled from 
this. 




Question VI  Concerning Witches who copulate with Devils. Why is it that 
Women are chiefly addicted to Evil superstitions?  

        There is also, concerning witches who copulate with devils, much 
difficulty in considering the methods by which such abominations are 
consummated. On the part of the devil: first, of what element the body is 
made that he assumes; secondly, whether the act is always accompanied by the 
injection of semen received from another; thirdly, as to time and place, 
whether he commits this act more frequently at one time than at another; 
fourthly, whether the act is invisible to any who may be standing by. And on 
the part of the women, it has to be inquired whether only they who were 
themselves conceived in this filthy manner are often visited by devils; or 
secondly, whether it is those who were offered to devils by midwives at the 
time of their birth; and thirdly, whether the actual venereal delectation of 
such is of a weaker sort. But we cannot here reply to all these questions, 
both because we are only engaged in a general study, and because in the 
second part of this work they are all singly explained by their operations, 
as will appear in the fourth chapter, where mention is made of each separate 
method. Therefore, let us now chiefly consider women; and first, why this 
kind of perfidy is found more in so fragile a sex than in men. And our 
inquiry will first be general, as to the general conditions of women; 
secondly, particular, as to which sort of women are found to be given to 
superstition and witchcraft; and thirdly, specifically with regard to 
midwives, who surpass all others in wickedness. 

Why Superstition is chiefly found in Women.

        As for the first question, why a greater number of witches is found 
in the fragile feminine sex than among men; it is indeed a fact that it were 
idle to contradict, since it is accredited by actual experience, apart from 
the verbal testimony of credibly witnesses. And without in any way 
detracting from a sex in which God has always taken great glory that His 
might should be spread abroad, let us say that various men have assigned 
various reasons for this fact, which nevertheless agree in principle. 
Wherefore it is good, for the admonition of women, to speak of this matter; 
and it has often been proved by experience that they are eager to hear of 
it, so long as it is set forth with discretion.
        For some learned men propound this reason; that there are three 
things in nature, the Tongue, an Ecclesiastic, and a Woman, which know no 
moderation in goodness or vice; and when they exceed the bounds of their 
condition they reach the greatest heights and the lowest depths of goodness 
and vice. When they are governed by a good spirit, they are most excellent 
in virtue; but when they are governed by an evil spirit, they indulge the 
worst possible vices.
        This is clear in the case of the tongue, since by its ministry most 
of the kingdoms have been brought into the faith of Christ; and the Holy 
Ghost appeared over the Apostles of Christ in tongues of fire. Other learned 
preachers also have had as it were the tongues of dogs, licking wounds and 
sores of the dying Lazarus. As it is said: With the tongues of dogs ye save 
your souls from the enemy.
        For this reason S. Dominic, the leader and father of the Order of 
Preachers, is represented in the figure of a barking to dog with a lighted 
torch in his mouth, that even to this day he may by his barking keep off the 
heretic wolves from the flock of Christ's sheep.
        It is also a matter of common experience that the tongue of one 
prudent man can subdue the wrangling of a multitude; wherefore not unjustly 
Solomon sings much in their praise, in Proverbs x.: In the lips of him that 
hath understanding wisdom is found. And again, The tongue of the just is as 
choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth. And again, The lips 
of the righteous feed many; but fools die for want of wisdom. For this cause 
he adds in chapter xvi, The preparations of the heart belong to man; but the 
answer of the tongue is from the Lord.
        But concerning an evil tongue you will find in Ecclesiasticus 
xxviii: A backbiting tongue hath disquieted many, and driven them from 
nation to nation: strong cities hath it pulled down, and overthrown the 
houses of great men. And by a backbiting tongue it means a third party who 
rashly or spitefully interferes between two contending parties.
        Secondly, concerning Ecclesiastics, that is to say, clerics and 
religious of either sex, S. John Chrysostom speaks on the text, He cast out 
them that bought and sold from the temple. From the priesthood arises 
everything good, and everything evil. S. Jerome in his epistle to Nepotian 
says: Avoid as you would the plague a trading priest, who has risen from 
poverty to riches, from a low to a high estate. And Blessed Bernard in his 
23rd Homily On the Psalms says of clerics: If one should arise as an open 
heretic, let him be cast out and put to silence; if he is a violent enemy, 
let all good men flee from him. But how are we to know which ones to cast 
out or to flee from? For they are confusedly friendly and hostile, peaceable 
and quarrelsome, neighbourly and utterly selfish.
        And in another place: Our bishops are become spearmen, and our 
pastors shearers. And by bishops here is meant those proud Abbots who impose 
heavy labours on their inferiors, which they would not themselves touch with 
their little finger. And S. Gregory says concerning pastors: No one does 
more harm in the Church than he who, having the name or order of sanctity, 
lives in sin; for no one dares to accuse him of sin, and therefore the sin 
is widely spread, since the sinner is honoured for the sanctity of his 
order. Blessed Augustine also speaks of monks to Vincent the Donatist: I 
freely confess to your charity before the Lord our God, which is the witness 
of my soul from the time I began to serve God, what great difficulty I have 
experienced in the fact that it is impossible to find either worse of better 
men than those who grace or disgrace the monasteries.
        Now the wickedness of women is spoken of in Ecclesiasticus xxv: 
There is no head above the head of a serpent: and there is no wrath above 
the wrath of a woman. I had rather dwell with a lion and a dragon than to 
keep house with a wicked woman. And among much which in that place precedes 
and follows about a wicked woman, he concludes: All wickedness is but little 
to the wickedness of a woman. Wherefore S. John Chrysostom says on the text, 
It is not good to marry (S. Matthew xix): What else is woman but a foe to 
friendship, an unescapable punishment, a necessary evil, a natural 
temptation, a desirable calamity, a domestic danger, a delectable detriment, 
an evil of nature, painted with fair colours! Therefore if it be a sin to 
divorce her when she ought to be kept, it is indeed a necessary torture; for 
either we commit adultery by divorcing her, or we must endure daily strife. 
Cicero in his second book of The Rhetorics says: The many lusts of men lead 
them into one sin, but the lust of women leads them into all sins; for the 
root of all woman's vices is avarice. And Seneca says in his Tragedies: A 
woman either loves or hates; there is no third grade. And the tears of woman 
are a deception, for they may spring from true grief, or they may be a 
snare. When a woman thinks alone, she thinks evil.
        But for good women there is so much praise, that we read that they 
have brought beatitude to men, and have saved nations, lands, and cities; as 
is clear in the case of Judith, Debbora, and Esther. See also I Corinthians 
vii: If a woman hath a husband that believeth not, let her not leave him. 
For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife. And 
Ecclesiasticus xxvi: Blessed is the man who has a virtuous wife, for the 
number of his days shell be doubled. And throughout that chapter much high 
praise is spoken of the excellence of good women; as also in the last 
chapter of Proverbs concerning a virtuous woman.
        And all this is made clear also in the New Testament concerning 
women and virgins and other holy women who have by faith led nations and 
kingdoms away from the worship of idols to the Christian religion. Anyone 
who looks at Vincent of Beauvais (in Spe. Histo., XXVI. 9) will find 
marvellous things of the conversion of Hungary by the most Christian Gilia, 
and of the Franks by Clotilda, the wife of Clovis. Wherefore in many 
vituperations that we read against women, the word woman is used to mean the 
lust of the flesh. As it is said: I have found a woman more bitter than 
death, and good woman subject to carnal lust.
        Other again have propounded other reasons why there are more 
superstitious women found than men. And the first is, that they are more 
credulous; and since the chief aim of the devil is to corrupt faith, 
therefore he rather attacks them. See Ecclesiasticus xix: He that is quick 
to believe is light-minded, and shall be diminished. The second reason is, 
that women are naturally more impressionable, and more ready to receive the 
influence of a disembodied spirit; and that when they use this quality well 
they are very good, but when they use it ill they are very evil.
        The third reason is that they have slippery tongues, and are unable 
to conceal from the fellow-women those things which by evil arts they know; 
and, since they are weak, they find an easy and secret manner of vindicating 
themselves by witchcraft. See Ecclesiasticus as quoted above: I had rather 
dwell with a lion and a dragon than to keep house with a wicked woman. All 
wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman. And to this may be 
added that, as they are very impressionable, they act accordingly.
        There are also others who bring forward yet other reasons, of which 
preachers should be very careful how they make use. For it is true that in 
the Old Testament the Scriptures have much that is evil to say about women, 
and this because of the first temptress, Eve, and her imitators; yet 
afterwards in the New Testament we find a change of name, as from Eva to Ave 
(as S. Jerome says), and the whole sin of Eve taken away by the benediction 
of Mary. Therefore preachers should always say as much praise of them as 
possible.
        But because in these times this perfidy is more often found in women 
than in men, as we learn by actual experience, if anyone is curious as to 
the reason, we may add to what has already been said the following: that 
since they are feebler both in mind and body, it is not surprising that they 
should come more under the spell of witchcraft.
        For as regards intellect, or the understanding of spiritual things, 
they seem to be of a different nature from men; a fact which is vouched for 
by the logic of the authorities, backed by various examples from the 
Scriptures. Terence says: Women are intellectually like children. And 
Lactantius (Institutiones, III): No woman understood philosophy except 
Temeste. And Proverbs xi, as it were describing a woman, says: As a jewel of 
gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion.
        But the natural reason is that she is more carnal than a man, as is 
clear from her many carnal abominations. And it should be noted that there 
was a defect in the formation of the first woman, since she was formed from 
a bent rib, that is, a rib of the breast, which is bent as it were in a 
contrary direction to a man. And since through this defect she is an 
imperfect animal, she always deceives. For Cato says: When a woman weeps she 
weaves snares. And again: When a woman weeps, she labours to deceive a man. 
And this is shown by Samson's wife, who coaxed him to tell her the riddle he 
had propounded to the Philistines, and told them the answer, and so deceived 
him. And it is clear in the case of the first woman that she had little 
faith; for when the serpent asked why they did not eat of every tree in 
Paradise, she answered: Of every tree, etc. - lest perchance we die. Thereby 
she showed that she doubted, and had little in the word of God. And all this 
is indicated by the etymology of the word; for Femina comes from Fe and 
Minus, since she is ever weaker to hold and preserve the faith. And this as 
regards faith is of her very nature; although both by grace and nature faith 
never failed in the Blessed Virgin, even at the time of Christ's Passion, 
when it failed in all men.
        Therefore a wicked woman is by her nature quicker to waver in her 
faith, and consequently quicker to abjure the faith, which is the root of 
witchcraft.
        And as to her other mental quality, that is, her natural will; when 
she hates someone whom she formerly loved, then she seethes with anger and 
impatience in her whole soul, just as the tides of the sea are always 
heaving and boiling. Many authorities allude to this cause. Ecclesiasticus 
xxv: There is no wrath above the wrath of a woman. And Seneca (Tragedies, 
VIII): No might of the flames or the swollen winds, no deadly weapon, is so 
much to be feared as the lust and hatred of a woman who has been divorced 
from the marriage bed.
        This is shown too in the woman who falsely accused Joseph, and 
caused him to be imprisoned because he would not consent to the crime of 
adultery with her (Genesis xxx). And truly the most powerful cause which 
contributes to the increase of witches is the woeful rivalry between married 
folk and unmarried women and men. This is so even among holy women, so what 
must it be among the others? For you see in Genesis xxi. how impatient and 
envious Sarah was of Hagar when she conceived: How jealous Rachel was of 
Leah because she had no children (Genesis xxx): and Hannah, who was barren, 
of the fruitful Peninnah (I. Kings i): and how Miriam (Numbers xii) murmured 
and spoke ill of Moses, and was therefore stricken with leprosy: and how 
Martha was jealous of Mary Magdalen, because she was busy and Mary was 
sitting down (S. Luke x). To this point is Ecclesiasticus xxxvii: Neither 
consult with a woman touching her of whom she is jealous. Meaning that it is 
useless to consult with her, since there is always jealousy, that is, envy, 
in a wicked woman. And if women behave thus to each other, how much more 
will they do so to men.

        Valerius Maximus tells how, when Phoroneus, the king of the Greeks, 
was dying, he said to his brother Leontius that there would have been 
nothing lacking to him of complete happiness if a wife had always been 
lacking to him. And when Leontius asked how a wife could stand in the way of 
happiness, he answered that all married men well knew. And when the 
philosopher Socrates was asked if one should marry a wife, he answered: If 
you do not, you are lonely, your family dies out, and a stranger inherits; 
if you do, you suffer perpetual anxiety, querelous complaints, reproaches 
concerning the marriage portion, the heavy displeasure of your relations, 
the garrulousness of a mother-in-law, cuckoldom, and no certain arrival of 
an heir. This he said as one who knew. For S. Jerome in his Contra 
Iouinianum says: This Socrates had two wives, whom he endured with much 
patience, but could not be rid of their contumelies and clamorous 
vituperations. So one day when they were complaining against him, he went 
out of the house to escape their plaguing, and sat down before the house; 
and the women then threw filthy water over him. But the philosopher was not 
disturbed by this, saying, “I knew the rain would come after the thunder.”
        There is also a story of a man whose wife was drowned in a river, 
who, when he was searching for the body to take it out of the water, walked 
up the stream. And when he was asked why, since heavy bodies do not rise but 
fall, he was searching against the current of the river, he answered: “When 
that woman was alive she always, both in word and deed, went contrary to my 
commands; therefore I am searching in the contrary direction in case even 
now she is dead she may preserve her contrary disposition.”
        And indeed, just as through the first defect in their intelligence 
that are more prone to abjure the faith; so through their second defect of 
inordinate affections and passions they search for, brood over, and inflict 
various vengeances, either by witchcraft, or by some other means. Wherefore 
it is no wonder that so great a number of witches exist in this sex.
        Women also have weak memories; and it is a natural vice in them not 
to be disciplined, but to follow their own impulses without any sense of 
what is due; this is her whole study, and all that she keeps in her memory. 
So Theophrastus says: If you hand over the whole management of the house to 
her, but reserve some minute detail to your own judgement, she will think 
that you are displaying a great want of faith in her, and will stir up a 
strife; and unless you quickly take counsel, she will prepare poison for 
you, and consult seers and soothsayers; and will become a witch.
        But as to domination by women, hear what Cicero says in the 
Paradoxes. Can he be called a free man whose wife governs him, imposes laws 
on him, orders him, and forbids him to do what he wishes, so that he cannot 
and dare not deny her anything that she asks? I should call him not only a 
slave, but the vilest of slaves, even if he comes from the noblest family. 
And Seneca, in the character of the raging Medea, says: Why do you cease to 
follow your happy impulse; how great is that part of vengeance in which you 
rejoice? Where he adduces many proofs that a woman will not be governed, but 
will follow her own impulse even to her own destruction. In the same way we 
read of many woman who have killed themselves either for love or sorrow 
because they were unable to work their vengeance.
        S. Jerome, writing of Daniel, tells a story of Laodice, wife of 
Antiochus king of Syria; how, being jealous lest he should love his other 
wife, Berenice, more than her, she first caused Berenice and her daughter by 
Antiochus to be slain, and then poisoned herself. And why? Because she would 
not be governed, and would follow her own impulse. Therefore, S. John 
Chrysostom says not without reason: O evil worse than all evil, a wicked 
woman, whether she be poor or rich. For if she be the wife of a rich man, 
she does not cease night and day to excite her husband with hot words, to 
use evil blandishments and violent importunations. And if she have a poor 
husband she does not cease to stir him also to anger and strife. And if she 
be a widow, she takes it upon herself everywhere to look down on everybody, 
and is inflamed to all boldness by the spirit of pride.
        If we inquire, we find that nearly all the kingdoms of the world 
have been overthrown by women. Troy, which was a prosperous kingdom, was, 
for the rape of one woman, Helen, destroyed, and many thousands of Greeks 
slain. The kingdom of the Jews suffered much misfortune and destruction 
through the accursed Jezebel, and her daughter Athaliah, queen of Judah, who 
caused her son's sons to be killed, that on their death she might reign 
herself; yet each of them was slain. The kingdom of the Romans endured much 
evil through Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, that worst of women. And so with 
others. Therefore it is no wonder if the world now suffers through the 
malice of women.
        And now let us examine the carnal desires of the body itself, whence 
has arise unconscionable harm to human life. Justly we may say with Cato of 
Utica: If the world could be rid of women, we should not be without God in 
our intercourse. For truly, without the wickedness of women, to say nothing 
of witchcraft, the world would still remain proof against innumerable 
dangers. Hear what Valerius said to Rufinus: You do not know that woman is 
the Chimaera, but it is good that you should know it; for that monster was 
of three forms; its face was that of a radiant and noble lion, it had the 
filthy belly of a goat, and it was armed with the virulent tail of a viper. 
And he means that a woman is beautiful to look upon, contaminating to the 
touch, and deadly to keep.
        Let us consider another property of hers, the voice. For as she is a 
liar by nature, so in her speech she stings while she delights us. Wherefore 
her voice is like the song of the Sirens, who with their sweet melody entice 
the passers-by and kill them. For they kill them by emptying their purses, 
consuming their strength, and causing them to forsake God. Again Valerius 
says to Rufinus: When she speaks it is a delight which flavours the sin; the 
flower of love is a rose, because under its blossom there are hidden many 
thorns. See Proverbs v, 3-4: Her mouth is smoother than oil; that is, her 
speech is afterwards as bitter as absinthium. [Her throat is smoother than 
oil. But her end is as bitter as wormwood.]
        Let us consider also her gait, posture, and habit, in which is 
vanity of vanities. There is no man in the world who studies so hard to 
please the good God as even an ordinary woman studies by her vanities to 
please men. An example of this is to be found in the life of Pelagia, a 
worldly woman who was wont to go about Antioch tired and adorned most 
extravagantly. A holy father, named Nonnus, saw her and began to weep, 
saying to his companions, that never in all his life had he used such 
diligence to please God; and much more he added to this effect, which is 
preserved in his orations.
        It is this which is lamented in Ecclesiastes vii, and which the 
Church even now laments on account of the great multitude of witches. And I 
have found a woman more bitter than death, who is the hunter's snare, and 
her heart is a net, and her hands are bands. He that pleaseth God shall 
escape from her; but he that is a sinner shall be caught by her. More bitter 
than death, that is, than the devil: Apocalypse vi, 8, His name was Death. 
For though the devil tempted Eve to sin, yet Eve seduced Adam. And as the 
sin of Eve would not have brought death to our soul and body unless the sin 
had afterwards passed on to Adam, to which he was tempted by Eve, not by the 
devil, therefore she is more bitter than death.
        More bitter than death, again, because that is natural and destroys 
only the body; but the sin which arose from woman destroys the soul by 
depriving it of grace, and delivers the body up to the punishment of sin.
        More bitter than death, again, because bodily death is an open and 
terrible enemy, but woman is a wheedling and secret enemy.
        And that she is more perilous than a snare does not speak of the 
snare of hunters, but of devils. For men are caught not only trough their 
carnal desires, when they see and hear women: for S. Bernard says: Their 
face is a burning wind, and their voice the hissing of serpents: but they 
also cast wicked spells on countless men and animals. And when it is said 
that her heart is a net, it speaks of the inscrutable malice which reigns in 
their hearts. And her hands are as bands for binding; for when they place 
their hands on a creature to bewitch it, then with the help of the devil, 
they perform their design.
        To conclude. All witchcraft comes from carnal lust, which is in 
women insatiable. See Proverbs xxx: There are three things that are never 
satisfied, yea, a fourth thing which says not, It is enough; that is, the 
mouth of the womb. Wherefore for the sake of fulfilling their lusts they 
consort even with devils. More such reasons could be brought forward, but to 
the understanding it is sufficiently clear that it is no matter for wonder 
that there are more women than men found infected with the heresy of 
witchcraft. And in consequence of this, it is better called the heresy of 
witches than of wizards, since the name is taken from the more powerful 
party. And blessed be the Highest Who has so far preserved the male sex from 
so great a crime: for since He was willing to be born and to suffer for us, 
therefore He has granted to men the privilege. 

What sort of Women are found to be above all Others Superstitious and 
Witches.

        As to our second inquiry, what sort of women more than others are 
found to be superstitious and infected with witchcraft; it must be said, as 
was shown in the preceding inquiry, that three general vices appear to have 
special dominion over wicked women, namely, infidelity, ambition, and lust. 
Therefore they are more than others inclined towards witchcraft, who more 
than others are given to these vices. Again, since of these vices the last 
chiefly predominates, women being insatiable, etc., it follows that those 
among ambitious women are more deeply infected who are more hot to satisfy 
their filthy lusts; and such are adulteresses, fornicatresses, and the 
concubines of the Great.
        Now there are, as it is said in the Papal Bull, seven methods by 
which they infect with witchcraft the venereal act and the conception of the 
womb: First, by inclining the minds of men to inordinate passion; second, by 
obstructing their generative force; third, by removing the members 
accomodated to that act; fourth, by changing men into beasts by their magic 
art; fifth, by destroying the generative force in women; sixth, by procuring 
abortion; seventh, by offering children to devils, besides other animals and 
fruits of the earth with which they work much harm. And all these will be 
considered later; but for present let us give our minds to the injuries 
towards men.
        And first concerning those who are bewitched into an inordinate love 
or hatred, this is a matter of a sort that it is difficult to discuss before 
the general intelligence. Yet it must be granted that it is a fact. For S. 
Thomas (IV, 34), treating of obstructions caused by witches, shows that God 
allows the devil greater power against men's venereal acts than against 
their other actions; and gives this reason, that this is likely to be so, 
since those women are chiefly apt to be witches who are most disposed to 
such acts.
        For he says that, since the first corruption of sin by which man 
became the slave of the devil came to us through the act of generation, 
therefore greater power is allowed by God to the devil in this act than in 
all others. Also the power of witches is more apparent in serpents, as it is 
said, than in other animals, because through the means of a serpent the 
devil tempted woman. For this reason also, as is shown afterwards, although 
matrimony is a work of God, as being instituted by Him, yet it is sometimes 
wrecked by the work of the devil: not indeed through main force, since then 
he might be though stronger than God, but with the permission of God, by 
causing some temporary or permanent impediment in the conjugal act.
        And touching this we may say what is known by experience; that these 
women satisfy their filthy lists not only in themselves, but even in the 
mighty ones of the age, of whatever state and condition; causing by all 
sorts of witchcraft the death of their souls through the excessive 
infatuation of carnal love, in such a way that for no shame or persuasion 
can they desist from such acts. And through such men, since witches will not 
permit any harm to come to them either from themselves or from others once 
they have them in their power, there arises the great danger of the time, 
namely, the extermination of the Faith. And in this way do witches every day 
increase.
        And would that this were not true according to experience. But 
indeed such hatred is aroused by witchcraft between those joined in the 
sacrament of matrimony, and such freezing up of the generative forces, that 
men are unable to perform the necessary action for begetting offspring. But 
since love and hate exist in the soul, which even the devil cannot enter, 
lest these things should seem incredibly to anyone, they must be inquired 
into; and by meeting argument with argument the matter will be made clear. 




Question VII  Whether Witches can Sway the Minds of Men to Love or Hatred.  

        It is asked whether devils, through the medium of witches, can 
change or incite the minds of men to inordinate love or hatred; and it is 
argued that, following the previous conclusions, they cannot do so. For 
there are three things in man: will, understanding, and body. The first is 
ruled by God (for, The heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord); the 
second is enlightened by an Angel; and the body is governed by the motions 
of the stars. And as the devils cannot effect changes in the body, even less 
have they power to incite love or hatred in the soul. The consequence is 
clear; that though they have more power over things corporeal than over 
things spiritual, they cannot change even the body, as has been often 
proved. For they cannot induce any substantial or accidental form, except is 
as it were their artificer. In this connexion is quoted what has been said 
before; that whoever believes that any creature can be changed for the 
better or worse or transformed into another kind or likeness, except by the 
Creator of all things, is worse than a pagan and a heretic.
        Besides, everything that acts with design knows its own effect. If, 
therefore, the devil could change the minds of men to hatred or love, he 
would also be able to see the inner thoughts of the heart; but this is 
contrary to what is said in the Book of Ecclesiastic Dogma: The devil cannot 
see our inner thoughts. And again in the same place: Not all our evil 
thoughts are from the devil, but sometimes they arise from our own choice.
        Besides, love and hatred are a matter of the will, which is rooted 
in the soul; therefore they cannot by any cunning be caused by the devil. 
The conclusion holds that He alone (as S. Augustine says) is able to enter 
into the soul, Who created it.
        Besides, it is not valid to argue that because he can influence the 
inner emotions, therefore he can govern the will. For the emotions are 
stronger than physical strength; and the devil can effect nothing in a 
physical way, such as the formation of flesh and blood; therefore he can 
effect nothing through the emotions.
        But against this. The devil is said to tempt men not only visibly 
but also invisibly; but this would not be true unless he were able to exert 
some influence over the inner mind. Besides, S. John Damascene says: All 
evil and all filthiness is devised by the devil. And Dionysius, de Divin. 
Nom. IV: The multitude of devils is the cause of all evil, etc.
        Answer. First, one sort of cause is to be distinguished from 
another: secondly, we shall show how the devil can affect the inner powers 
of the mind, that is the emotions; and thirdly, we shall draw the fit 
conclusion. And as to the first, it is to be considered that the cause of 
anything can be understood in two ways; either as direct, or as indirect. 
For when something cause a disposition to some effect, it is said to be an 
occasional and indirect cause of that effect. In this way it may be said 
that he who chops wood is the cause of the actual fire. And similarly we may 
say that the devil is the cause of all our sins; for he incited the first 
man to sin, from whose sin it has been handed down to the whole human race 
to have an inclination towards sin. And in this way are to be understood the 
words of S. John Damascene and Dionysius.
        But a direct cause is one that directly causes an effect; and in 
this sense the devil is not the cause of all sin. For all sins are not 
committed at the instigation of the devil, but some are of our own choosing. 
For Origen says: Even if the devil were not, men would still lust after food 
and venery and such things. And from these inordinate lusts much may result, 
unless such appetites be reasonably restrained. But to restrain such 
ungoverned desire is the part of man's free-will, over which even the devil 
has no power.
        And because this distinction is not sufficient to explain how the 
devil at times produces a frantic infatuation of love, it is further to be 
noted that though he cannot cause that inordinate love by directly 
compelling a man's will, yet he can do so by means of persuasion. And this 
again in two ways, either visibly or invisibly. Visibly, when he appears to 
witches in the form of a man, and speaks to them materially, persuading them 
to sin. So he tempted our first parents in Paradise in the form of a 
serpent; and so he tempted Christ in the wilderness, appearing to Him in 
visible form.
        But it is not to be thought that this is the only way he influences 
a man; for in that case no sin would proceed from the devil's instruction, 
except such as were suggested by him in visible form. Therefore it must be 
said that even invisibly he instigates man to sin. And this he does in two 
ways, either by persuasion or by disposition. By persuasion, he presents 
something to the understanding as being a good thing. And this he can do in 
three ways; for he presents it either to the intellect, or to the inner 
perceptions, or to the outer. And as for the intellect; the human intellect 
can be helped by a good Angel to understand a thing by means of 
enlightenment, as Dionysius says; and to understand a thing, according to 
Aristotle, is to suffer something: therefore the devil can impress some form 
upon the intellect, by which the act of understanding is called forth.
        And it may be argued that the devil can do this by his natural 
power, which is not, as had been shown, diminished. It is to be said, 
however, that he cannot do this by means of enlightenment, but by 
persuasion. For the intellect of man is of that condition that, the more it 
is enlightened, the more it knows the truth, and the more it can defend 
itself from deception. And because the devil intends his deception to be 
permanent, therefore no persuasion that he uses can be called enlightenment: 
although it may be called revelation, in that when he invisibly uses 
persuasion, by means of some impression he plants something on the inner or 
outer sense. And by this the reasoning intellect is persuaded to perform 
some action.
        But as to how he is enabled to create an impression on the inner 
sense, it is to be noted that the bodily nature is naturally born to be 
moved locally by the spiritual; which is clear from the case of our own 
bodies, which are moved by souls; and the same is the case with the stars. 
But it is not by nature adapted to be directly subject to influences, by 
which we mean outside influences, not those with which it is informed. 
Wherefore the concurrence of some bodily agent is necessary, as is proved in 
the 7th book of the Metaphysics. Corporeal matter naturally obeys a good or 
bad angel as to the local motion; and it is due to this that devils can 
through motion collect semen, and employ it for the production of wonderful 
results. This was how it happened that Pharao's magicians produced serpents 
and actual animals, when corresponding active and passive agents were 
brought together. Therefore there is nothing to prevent the devils from 
effecting anything that appertains to the local motion of corporeal matter, 
unless God prevent it.
        And now let us examine how the devil can through local motion excite 
the fancy and inner sensory perceptions of a man by apparitions and 
impulsive actions. It is to be noted that Aristotle (De Somno et Uigilia) 
assigns the cause of apparitions in dreams through local motion to the fact 
that, when an animal sleeps the blood flows to the inmost seat of the 
senses, from which descend motions or impressions which remain from past 
impressions preserved in the mind or inner perception; and these are Fancy 
or Imagination, which are the same thing according to S. Thomas, as will be 
shown.
        For fancy or imagination is as it were the treasury of ideas 
received through the senses. And through this it happens that devils stir up 
the inner perceptions, that is the power of conserving images, that they 
appear to be a new impression at that moment received from exterior things.
        It is true that all do not agree to this; but if anyone wishes to 
occupy himself with this question, he must consider the number and the 
office of the inner perceptions. According to Avicenna, in his book On the 
Mind, these are five: namely, Common Sense, Fancy, Imagination, Thought, and 
Memory. But S. Thomas, in the First Part of Question 79, says that they are 
only four, since Fancy and Imagination are the same thing. For fear of 
prolixity I omit much more that has variously been said on this subject.
        Only this must be said; that fancy is the treasury of ideas, but 
memory appears to be something different. For fancy is the treasury or 
repository of ideas received through the senses; but memory is the treasury 
of instincts, which are not received through the senses. For when a man sees 
a wolf, he runs away, not because of its ugly colour or appearance, which 
are ideas received through the outer senses and conserved in his fancy; but 
he runs away because the wolf is his natural enemy. And this he knows 
through some instinct or fear, which is apart from thought, which recognized 
the wolf as hostile, but a dog as friendly. But the repository of those 
instincts is memory. And reception and retention are two different things in 
animal nature; for those who are of a humid disposition receive readily, but 
retain badly; and the contrary is the case of those with a dry humour.
        To return to the question. The apparitions that come in dreams to 
sleepers proceed from the ideas retained in the repository of their mind, 
through a natural local motion caused by the flow of blood to the first and 
inmost seat of their faculties of perception; and we speak of an instrinsic 
local motion in the head and the cells of the brain.
        And this can also happen through a similar local motion created by 
devils. Also such things happen not only to the sleeping, but even to those 
who are awake. For in these also the devils can stir up and excite the inner 
perceptions and humours, so that ideas retained in the repositories of their 
minds are drawn out and made apparent to the faculties of fancy and 
imagination, so that such men imagine these things to be true. And this is 
called interior temptation.
        And it is no wonder that the devil can do this by his own natural 
power; since any man by himself, being awake and having the use of his 
reason, can voluntarily draw from his repositories the images he has 
retained in them; in such a way that he can summon to himself the images of 
whatsoever things he pleases. And this being granted, it is easy to 
understand the matter of excessive infatuation in love.
        Now there are two ways in which devils can, as has been said, raise 
up this kind of images. Sometimes they work without enchaining the human 
reason, as has been said in the matter of temptation, and the example of 
voluntary imagination. But sometimes the use of reason is entirely chained 
up; and this may be exemplified by certain naturally defective persons, and 
by madmen and drunkards. Therefore it is no wonder that devils can, with 
God's permission, chain up the reason; and such men are called delirious, 
because their senses have been snatched away by the devil. And this they do 
in two ways, either with or without the help of witches. For Aristotle, in 
the work we have quoted, says that anyone who lives in passion is moved by 
only a little thing, as a lover by the remotest likeness of his love, and 
similarly with one who feels hatred. Therefore devils, who have learned from 
men's acts to which passions they are chiefly subject, incite them to this 
sort of inordinate love or hatred, impressing their purpose on men's 
imagination the more strongly and effectively, as they can do so the more 
easily. And this is the more easy for a lover to summon up the image of his 
love from his memory, and retain it pleasurably in his thoughts.
        But they work by witchcraft when they do these things through and at 
the instance of witches, by reason of a pact entered into with them. But it 
is not possible to treat of such matters in detail, on account of the great 
number of instances both among the clergy and among the laity. For how many 
adulterers have put away the most beautiful wives to lust after the vilest 
of women!
        We know of an old woman who, according to the common account of the 
brothers in that monastery even up to this day, in this manner not only 
bewitched three successive Abbots, but even killed them, and in the same way 
drove the fourth out of his mind. For she herself publicly confessed it, and 
does not fear to say: I did so and I do so, and they are not able to keep 
from loving me because they have eaten so much of my dung - measuring off a 
certain length on her arm. I confess, moreover, that since we had no case to 
prosecute her or bring her to trial, she survives to this day.
        It will be remembered that it was said that the devil invisibly 
lures a man to sin, not only by means of persuasion, as has been said, but 
also by the means of disposition. Although this is not very pertinent, yet 
be it said that by a similar admonition of the disposition and humours of 
men, he renders some more disposed to anger, or concupiscence, or other 
passions. For it is manifest that a man who has a body so disposed is more 
prone to concupiscence and anger and such passions; and when they are 
aroused, he is more apt to surrender to them. But because it is difficult to 
quote precedents, therefore an easier method must be found of declaring them 
for the admonition of the people. And in the Second Part of this book we 
treat of the remedies by which men so bewitched can be set free. 

The Method of Preaching to the People about Infatuate Love.

        Concerning what has been said above, a preacher asks this question: 
Is it a Catholic view to maintain that witches can infect the minds of men 
with an inordinate love of strange women, and so inflame their hearts that 
by no shame or punishment, by no words or actions can they be forced to 
desist from such love; and that similarly they can stir up such hatred 
between married couples that they are unable in any way to perform the 
procreant functions of marriage; so that, indeed, in the untimely silence of 
night, they cover great distances in search of mistresses and irregular 
lovers?
        As to this matter, he may, if he wishes, find some arguments in the 
preceding question. Otherwise, it need only be said that there are 
difficulties in those questions on account of love and hate. For these 
passions invade the will, which is in its own act always free, and not to be 
coerced by and creature except God, Who can govern it. From which it is 
clear that neither the devil nor a witch working by his power can force a 
man's will to love or to hate. Again, since the will, like the 
understanding, exists subjectively in the soul, and He alone can enter into 
the soul Who created it, therefore this question presents many difficulties 
in the matter of unravelling the truth of it.
        But notwithstanding this, we must speak first of infatuation and 
hatred, and secondly about the bewitching of the generative power. And as to 
the first, although the devil cannot directly operate upon the understanding 
and will of man, yet, according to all the learned Theologians in the 2nd 
Book of Sentences, on the subject of the power of the devil, he can act upon 
the body, or upon the faculties belonging to or allied to the body, whether 
they be the inner or outer perceptions. This is authoritatively and 
reasonably proved in the preceding question, if one cares to look; but if 
not, there is the authority of Job ii: The Lord said unto Satan, Behold, he 
is in thine hand. That is, Job is in his power. But this was only in regard 
to the body, for He would not give his soul into his power. Wherefore He 
said: Only save thou his life; that is, keep it unharmed. And that power He 
gave him over his body, He gave also over all the faculties allied to the 
body, which are the four or five outer and inner perceptions, namely Common 
Sense, Fancy or Imagination, Thought, and Memory.
        If no other instance can be given, let us take an example from pigs 
and sheep. For pigs know by instinct their way home. And by natural instinct 
sheep distinguish a wolf from a dog, knowing one to be the enemy and the 
other the friend of their nature.
        Consequently, since all our reasoned knowledge comes from the senses 
(for Aristotle in the 2nd book On the Mind says that an intelligent man must 
take notice of phantasms), therefore the devil can affect the inner fancy, 
and darken the understanding. And this is not to act immediately upon the 
mind, but through the medium of phantasms. Because, also, nothing is loved 
until it is known.
        As many examples as are needed could be taken from gold, which the 
miser loves because he knows its power, etc. Therefore when the 
understanding is darkened, the will also is darkened in its affectations. 
Moreover, the devil can effect this either with or without the help of a 
witch; and such things can even happen through mere want of foresight. But 
we shall give examples of each kind. For, as it is said in S. James i: Every 
man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Then when 
lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin, when it is finished, bringeth 
forth death. Again, when Schechem saw Dinah going out to see the daughters 
of the land, he loved her, and seized her, and lay with her, and his soul 
clave unto her (Genesis xxxiv). And according to the gloss: When the infirm 
mind forsakes its own business, and takes heed, like Dinah, of that of other 
people, it is led astray by habit, and becomes one with the sinners.
        Secondly, that this lust can arise apart from witchcraft, and simply 
through the temptation of the devil, is shown as follows. For we read in II. 
Samuel xiii that Ammon desperately loved his own sister Tamar, and yearned 
greatly for her, so that he grew ill for love for her. But no one would fall 
into so great and foul a crime unless he were totally corrupt, and 
grievously tempted by the devil. Wherefore the gloss says: This is a warning 
to us, and was permitted by God that we should always be on guard lest vice 
should get the mastery over us, and the prince of sin, who promises a false 
peace to those who are in danger, finding us ready should slay us unaware.
        Mention is made of this sort of passion in the Book of the Holy 
Fathers, where it says that, however far they withdrew themselves from all 
carnal lusts, yet they were sometimes tempted by the love of women more than 
could possibly be believed. Wherefore in II. Corinthians xii the Apostle 
says: There was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to 
buffet me. On which the gloss says: It was given to me to be tempted by 
lust. But he who is tempted and does not yield is no sinner, but it is a 
matter for the exercise of virtue. And by temptation is understood that of 
the devil, not that of the flesh, which is always venial in a little sin. 
The preacher could find many examples if he pleased.
        The third point, that infatuate love proceeds from the evil works of 
the devil, has been discussed above; and we speak of this temptation.
        It may be asked how it is possible to tell whether such inordinate 
love proceeds not from the devil but only from a witch. And the answer is 
that there are many ways. First, if the man tempted has a beautiful and 
honest wife, or the converse in the case of a woman, etc. Secondly, if the 
judgement of the reason is so chained up that by no blows or words or deeds, 
or even by shame, can he be made to desist from that lust. And thirdly, in 
especial, when he cannot contain himself, but that he is at times 
unexpectedly, and in spite of the roughness of the journey, forced to be 
carried through great distances (as anyone can learn from the confessions of 
such men), both by day and by night. For as S. John Chrysostom says on 
Matthew xx concerning the ass upon which Christ rode: When the devil 
possesses the will of a man with sin, he carries him at his will where he 
pleases. Giving the example of a ship in the sea without a rudder, which the 
winds carry about at their pleasure; and of a man firmly sitting a horse; 
and a King having dominion over a tyrant. And fourthly, it is shown by the 
fact that they are sometimes suddenly and unexpectedly carried away, and at 
times transformed, so that nothing can prevent it. It is shown also by the 
hideousness of their very appearance.
        And before we proceed to the further question of witches, touching 
the powers of generation, which follows, we must first resolve the 
arguments. 

Here Follow the Resolutions of the Arguments.

        But for the answer to the arguments: for the first, that the will of 
man is ruled by God, just as his understanding is by a good Angel, the 
solution is clear. For the intellect is enlightened by a good Angel only to 
the knowledge of the truth, from which proceeds the love of that which is 
good, for the True and the Actual are the same thing. So also the intellect 
can be darkened by a bad angel in the knowledge of what appear to be true; 
and this through a confusion of the ideas and images received and stored by 
the perceptions, from which comes an inordinate love of the apparently good, 
such as bodily delectation, which such men seek after.
        As to the second argument, that the devil cannot effect physical 
changes in the body; this is in part true, and in part not, and this is with 
reference to three sorts of mutation. For the devil cannot change the body 
in such a way that its whole shape and appearance is altered (which is 
rather to be called a new production than a change) without the help of some 
agent, or with the permission of God. But if we speak of a change in 
quality, as in the matter of sickness and health, as has been shown before, 
he can inflict upon the body various diseases, even to taking away the 
reason, and so can cause inordinate hatred and love.
        And a third kind of mutation can be added, which is when a good or 
bad angel enters into the body, in the same way that we say that God alone 
is able to enter into the soul, that is, the essence of life. But when we 
speak of an angel, especially a bad angel, entering the body, as in the case 
of an obsession, he does not enter beyond the limits of the essence of the 
body; for in this way only God the Creator can enter, Who gave it to be as 
it were the intrinsic operation of life. But the devil is said to enter the 
body when he effects something about the body: for when he works, there he 
is, as S. John Damascene says. And then he works within the bounds of 
corporeal matter, but not within the very essence of the body.
        For this it appears that the body has two properties, matter and 
spirit. And this is like the distinction between the apparent and the real. 
Therefore when devils enter the body, they enter the power belonging to the 
bodily organs, and can so create impressions on those powers. And so it 
happens that through such operations and impressions a phantasm is projected 
before the understanding, such as the seeing of colours, as it is said in 
the 3rd book de Anima. And so this impression penetrates also to the will. 
For the will takes its conception of what is good from the intellect, 
according as the intellect accepts something as good either in truth or in 
appearance.
        As for the third argument: a knowledge of the thoughts of the heart 
may come about in two ways, either from seeing their efforts or by reading 
them actually in the intellect. In the first way they can be known not only 
by an angel, but even by man, although it will be shown that an angel has 
more skill in this matter. For sometimes the thoughts are made evident, not 
only by some external action, but even by a change in the countenance. And 
doctors also can discern some affections of the mind through the pulse. 
Wherefore S. Augustine says (de Diuin. Daem.) that sometimes it is very easy 
to tell a man's disposition, not only from his words, but from his very 
thoughts, which are signs of the soul expressed in the body; although in his 
book of Retractions he says that no definite rule can be laid down how this 
is done; and I think that he is reluctant to admit that the devil can know 
the inner thoughts of the heart.
        From another point of view, the thoughts of the intellect and the 
affectations of the will can be known only by God. For the will of a 
rational creature is subject only to God, and He alone can work in it Who is 
its first cause and ultimate end. Therefore that which is in the will, or 
depends only on the will, is known only to God. Moreover, it is manifest 
what depends only on the will, if one considers things by their resultant 
actions. For when a man has the quality of knowledge, and the understanding 
that comes from it, he uses it when he wills.
        It is proved, then, from what has been said, that a spirit cannot 
enter the soul, therefore he cannot, naturally, see what is in the mind, 
especially what is in the inner depths of the soul. Wherefore, when it is 
argued that the devil cannot see the thoughts of the heart, and therefore 
cannot move the hearts of men to love or hatred, it is answered that he does 
learn men's thoughts through their visible effects, and is more skilful in 
this matter than man; and so by subtle ways he can move men to love and 
hatred, by creating phantasms and darkening the intellect.
        And this must be said by way of comfort to relieve the apprehensions 
of the virtuous: that when the sensible exterior and bodily change which 
accompanied men's thoughts is so vague and indeterminate that the devil 
cannot by it arrive at any certain knowledge of the thoughts, especially 
when the virtuous at times take a little leisure from study and good works, 
he molests them then chiefly in dreams; as is known by experience. But when 
the physical effect of thought is strong and determinate, the devil can know 
by a man's appearance whether his thoughts are turned towards envy or 
luxury. But we find that it must be left an open question whether he can by 
this means have certain knowledge in respect of all circumstances, as such 
and such; although it is true that he can know such circumstances from their 
subsequent results.
        And fourthly: although to enter the soul belongs only to God, yet it 
is possible for a good or bad angel to enter the body and the faculties 
allied to the body, in the manner which has been shown above. And in this 
way hatred and love can be aroused in such a man. For the other argument, 
that the powers of the spirit are greater than the physical powers, which 
themselves cannot be changed by the devil, in so far as they can be hastened 
or retarded in the flesh and bone. But he does this, not for the sake of 
impeding or stimulating the inner or outer perceptions, but for his own 
gain; since he derives his chief benefit by the deception of the senses and 
the delusion of the intellect. 




Question VIII  Whether Witches can Hebetate the Powers of Generation or 
Obstruct the Venereal Act.  

        Now the fact that adulterous drabs and whores are chiefly given to 
witchcraft is substantiated by the spells which are cast by witches upon the 
act of generation. And to make the truth more clear, we will consider the 
arguments of those who are in disagreement with us on this matter. And first 
it is argued that such a bewitching is not possible, because if it were it 
would apply equally to those who are married; and if this were conceded, 
then, since matrimony is God's work and witchcraft is the devil's, the 
devil's work would be stronger than God's. But if it is allowed that it can 
only affect fornicators and the unmarried, this involves a return to the 
opinion that witchcraft does not really exist, but only in men's 
imagination; and this was refuted in the First Question. Or else some reason 
will be found why it should affect the unmarried and not the married; and 
the only possible reason is that matrimony is God's work. And since, 
according to the Theologians, this reason is not valid, there still remains 
the argument that it would make the devil's work stronger than God's; and 
since it would be unseemly to make such an assertion, it is also unseemly to 
maintain that the venereal act can be obstructed by witchcraft.
        Again, the devil cannot obstruct the other natural actions, such as 
eating, walking and standing, as is apparent from the fact that, if he 
could, he could destroy the whole world.
        Besides, since the venereal act is common to all women, if it were 
obstructed it would be so with reference to all women; but this is not so, 
and therefore the first argument is good. For the facts prove that it is not 
so; for when a man says that he has been bewitched, he is still quite 
capable as regards other women, though not with her with whom he is unable 
to copulate; and the reason for this is that he does not wish to, and 
therefore cannot effect anything in the matter.
        On the contrary and true side is the chapter in the Decretals (If by 
sortilege, etc.): as is also the opinion of all the Theologians and 
Canonists, where they treat of the obstruction to marriage caused by 
witchcraft.
        There is also another reason: that since the devil is more powerful 
than man, and a man can obstruct the generative powers by means of frigid 
herbs or anything else that can be thought of, therefore much more can the 
devil do this, since he has greater knowledge and cunning.
        Answer. The truth is sufficiently evident from two matters which 
have already been argued, although the method of obstruction has not been 
specifically declared. For it has been shown that witchcraft does not exist 
only in men's imaginations, and not in fact; but that truly and actually in 
numerable bewitchments can happen, with the permission of God. It has been 
shown, too, that God permits it more in the case of the generative powers, 
because of their greater corruption, than in the case of other human 
actions. But concerning the method by which such obstruction is procured, it 
is to be noted that it does not affect only the generative powers, but also 
the powers of the imagination or fancy.
        And as to this, Peter of Palude (III, 34) notes five methods. For he 
says that the devil, being a spirit, has power over a corporeal creature to 
cause or prevent a local motion. Therefore he can prevent bodies from 
approaching each other, either directly or indirectly, by interposing 
himself in some bodily shape. In this way it happened to the young man who 
was betrothed to an idol and nevertheless married a young maiden, and was 
consequently unable to copulate with her. Secondly, he can excite a man to 
that act, or freeze his desire for it, by the virtue of secret things of 
which he best knows the power. Thirdly, he can also disturb a man's 
perception and imagination as to make the woman appear loathsome to him: 
since he can, as had been said, influence the imagination. Fourthly, he can 
directly prevent the erection of that member which is adapted to 
fructification, just as he can prevent local motion. Fifthly, he can prevent 
the flow of the vital essence to the members in which lie the motive power; 
by closing as it were the seminary ducts, so that it does not descend to the 
generative channels, or falls back from them, or does not project from them, 
or in any of many ways fails in its function.
        And he continues in agreement with what has been treated of above by 
other Doctors. For God allows the devil more latitude in respect of this 
act, through which sin was first spread abroad, than of other human acts. 
Similarly, serpents are more subject to magic spells than are other animals. 
And a little later he says: It is the same in the case of a woman, for the 
devil can so darken her understanding that she considers her husband so 
loathsome that not for all the world would she allow him to lie with her.
        Later he wishes to find the reason why more men than women are 
bewitched in respect of that action; and he says that such obstruction 
generally occurs in the matter of erection, which can more easily happen to 
men; and therefore more men than women are bewitched. It might also be said 
that, the greater part of witches being women, they lust more for men than 
for women. Also they act in the despite of married women, finding every 
opportunity for adultery when the husband is able to copulate with other 
women but not with his own wife; and similarly the wife also has to seek 
other lovers.
        He adds also that God allows the devil to afflict sinners more 
bitterly than the just. Wherefore the Angel said to Tobias: He gives the 
devil power over those who are given up to lust. But he has power also 
against the just sometimes, as in the case of Job, but not in respect of the 
genital functions. Wherefore they ought to devote themselves to confession 
and other good works, lest the iron remain in the wound, and it be in vain 
to apply remedies. So much for Peter. But the method of removing such 
effects will be shown in the Second Part of this work. 

Some Incidental Doubts on the subject of Copulation prevented by Evil Spells 
are made Clear.

        But incidentally, if it is asked why this function is sometimes 
obstructed in respect of one woman but not of another, the answer, according 
to S. Bonaventura, is this. Either the enchantress of witch afflicts in this 
way those persons upon whom the devil has determined; or it is because God 
will not permit it to be inflicted on certain persons. For the hidden 
purpose of God in this is obscure, as is shown in the case of the wife of 
Tobias. And he adds:
        If it is asked how the devil does this, it is to be said that he 
obstructs the genital power, not intrinsically by harming the organ, but 
extrinsically by rendering it useless. Therefore, since it is an artificial 
and not a natural obstruction, he can make a man impotent towards one woman 
but not towards others: by taking away the inflammation of his lust for her, 
but not for other women, either through his own power, or through some herb 
or stone, or some occult natural means. And this agrees with the words of 
Peter of Palude.
        Besides, since impotency in this act is sometimes due to coldness of 
nature, or some natural defect, it is asked how it is possible to 
distinguish whether it is due to witchcraft of not. Hostiensis gives the 
answer in his Summa (but this must not be publicly preached): When the 
member is in no way stirred, and can never perform the act of coition, this 
is a sign of frigidity of nature; but when it is stirred and becomes erect, 
but yet cannot perform, it is a sign of witchcraft.
        It is to be noted also that impotence of the member to perform the 
act is not the only bewitchment; but sometimes the woman is caused to be 
unable to conceive, or else she miscarries.
        Note, moreover, that according to what is aid down by the Canons, 
whoever through desire of vengeance or for hatred does anything to a man or 
a woman to prevent them from begetting or conceiving must be considered a 
homicide. And note, further, that the Canon speaks of loose lovers who, to 
save their mistresses from shame, use contraceptives, such as potions, or 
herbs that contravene nature, without any help from devils. And such 
penitents are to be punished as homicides. But witches who do such things by 
witchcraft are by law punishable by the extreme penalty, as had been touched 
on above in the First Question.
        And for a solution of the arguments; when it is objected that these 
things cannot happen to those joined together in matrimony, it is further to 
be noted that, even if the truth in this matter had not already been made 
sufficiently plain, yet these things can truly and actually happen just as 
much to those who are married as to those who are not. And the prudent 
reader who has plenty of books, will refer to the Theologians and the 
Canonists, especially where they speak of the impotent and bewitched. He 
will find them in agreement in condemning two errors: especially with regard 
to married people who seem to think that such bewitchment cannot happen to 
those who are joined in matrimony, advancing the reason that the devil 
cannot destroy the works of God.
        And the first error which they condemn is that of those who say that 
there is no witchcraft in the world, but only in the imagination of men who, 
through their ignorance of hidden causes which no man yet understands, 
ascribe certain natural effects to witchcraft, as though they were effected 
not by hidden causes, but by devils working either by themselves or in 
conjunction with witches. And although all other Doctors condemn this error 
as a pure falsehood, yet S. Thomas impugns it more vigorously and 
stigmatizes it as actual heresy, saying that this error proceeds from the 
root of infidelity. And since infidelity in a Christian is accounted heresy, 
therefore such deserve to be suspected as heretics. And this matter was 
touched on in the First Question, though it was not there declared so 
plainly. For if anyone considers the other sayings of S. Thomas in other 
places, he will find the reasons why he affirms that such an error proceeds 
from the root of infidelity.
        For in his questions concerning Sin, where he treats of devils, and 
in his first question, whether devils have bodies that naturally belong to 
them, among many other matters he makes mention of those who referred every 
physical effect to the virtue of the stars; to which they said that the 
hidden causes of terrestrial effects were subject. And he says: It must be 
considered that the Peripatetics,the followers of Aristotle, held that 
devils did not really exist; but that those things which are attributed to 
devils proceeded from the power of the stars and other natural phenomena. 
Wherefore S. Augustine says (de Ciuitate Dei, X), that it was the opinion of 
Porphyry that from herbs and animals, and certain sounds and voice, and from 
figures and figments observed in the motion of the stars, powers 
corresponding to the stars were fabricated on earth by men in order to 
explain various natural effect. And the error of these is plain, since they 
referred everything to hidden causes in the stars, holding that devils were 
only fabricated by the imagination of men.
        But this opinion is clearly proved to be false by S. Thomas in the 
same work; for some works of devils are found which can in no way proceed 
from any natural cause. For example, when one who is possessed by devil 
speaks in an unknown language; and many other devil's works are found, both 
in the Rhapsodic and the Necromantic arts, which can in no way proceed 
except from some Intelligence, which may be naturally good but is evil in 
its intention. And therefore, because of these incongruities, other 
Philosophers were compelled to admit that there were devils. Yet they 
afterwards fell into various errors, some thinking that the souls of men, 
when they left their bodies, became devils. For this reason many Soothsayers 
have killed children, that they might have their souls as their co-
operators; and many other errors are recounted.
        From this it is clear that not without reason does the Holy Doctor 
say that such an opinion proceeds from the root of infidelity. And anyone 
who wishes may read S. Augustine (de Ciuitate Dei, VIII, IX) on the various 
errors of infidels concerning the nature of devils. And indeed the common 
opinion of all Doctors, quoted in the above-mentioned work, against those 
who err in this way by denying that there are any witches, is very weighty 
in its meaning, even if it is expressed in few words. For they say that they 
who maintain that there is no witchcraft in the world go contrary to the 
opinion of all the Doctors, and of the Holy Scripture; and declare that 
there are devils, and that devils have power over the bodies and 
imaginations of men, with the permission of God. Wherefore, those who are 
the instruments of the devils, at whose instance the devil at times do 
mischief to a creature, they call witches.
        Now in the Doctor's condemnation of this first error nothing is said 
concerning those joined together in matrimony; but this is made clear in 
their condemnation of the second error of believing that, though witchcraft 
exists and abounds in the world, even against carnal copulation, yet, since 
no such bewitchment can be considered to be permanent, it never annuls a 
marriage that has already been contracted. Here is where they speak of those 
joined in matrimony. Now in refuting this error (for we do so, even though 
it is little to the point, for the sake of those who have not many books), 
it is to be noted that they refute it by maintaining that it is against all 
precedent, and contrary to all laws both ancient and modern.
        Wherefore the Catholic Doctors make the following distinction, that 
impotence caused by witchcraft is either temporary or permanent. And if it 
is temporary, then it does not annul the marriage. Moreover, it is presumed 
to be temporary of they are able to healed of the impediment within three 
years from their cohabitation, having taken all possible pain, either 
through the sacraments of the Church, or through other remedies, to be 
cured. But if they are not then cured by any remedy, from that time it is 
presumed to be permanent. And in that case it either precedes both the 
contracting of a marriage, and annuls one that is not yet contracted; or 
else it follows the contract of marriage but precedes its consummation, and 
then also, according to some, it annuls the previous contract. (For it is 
said in Book XXXII, quest. 1. cap. 1 that the confirmation of a marriage 
consists in its carnal office.) Or else it is subsequent to the consummation 
of the marriage, and then the matrimonial bond is not annulled. Much is 
noted there concerning impotence by Hostiensis, and Godfrey, and the Doctors 
and Theologians.
        To the arguments. As to the first, it is made sufficiently clear 
from what has been said. For as to the argument that God's works can be 
destroyed by the devil's works, if witchcraft has power against those who 
are married, it has no force; rather does the opposite appear, since the 
devil can do nothing without God's permission. For he does not destroy by 
main force like a tyrant, but through some extrinsic art, as is proved 
above. And the second argument is also made quite clear, why God allows this 
obstruction more in the case of the venereal act than of other acts. But the 
devil has power also over other acts, when God permits. Wherefore it is not 
sound to argue that he could destroy the whole world. And the third 
objection is similarly answered by what has been said. 




Question IX  Whether Witches may work some Prestidigatory Illusion so that 
the Male Organ appears to be entirely removed and separate from the Body.  

        Here is declared the truth about diabolic operations with regard to 
the male organ. And to make plain the facts in this matter, it is asked 
whether witches can with the help of devils really and actually remove the 
member, or whether they only do so apparently by some glamour or illusion. 
And that they can actually do so is argued a fortiori; for since devils can 
do greater things than this, as killing them or carrying them from place to 
place - as was shown above in the cases of Job and Tobias - therefore they 
can also truly and actually remove men's members.
        Again, an argument is taken from the gloss on the visitations of bad 
Angels, in the Psalms: God punishes by means of bad Angels, as He often 
punished the People of Israel with various diseases, truly and actually 
visited upon their bodies. Therefore the member is equally subject to such 
visitations.
        It may be said that this is done with the Divine permission. And in 
that case, it has already been said that God allows more power of witchcraft 
over the genital functions, on account of the first corruption of sin which 
came to us from the act of generation, so also He allows greater power over 
the actual genital organ, even to its removal.
        And again, it was a greater thing to turn Lot's wife into a pillar 
of salt than it is to take away the male organ; and that (Genesis xix) was a 
real and actual, not an apparent, metamorphosis (for it is said that that 
pillar is still to be seen), And this was done by a bad Angel; just as the 
good Angels struck the men of Sodom with blindness, so that they could not 
find the door of the house. And so it was with the other punishments of the 
men of Gomorrah. The gloss, indeed, affirms that Lot's wife was herself 
tainted with that vice, and therefore she was punished.
        And again, whoever can create a natural shape can also take it away. 
But devils have created many natural shapes, as is clear from Pharao's 
magicians, who with the help of devils made frogs and serpents. Also S. 
Augustine, in Book LXXXIII, says that those things which are visibly done by 
the lower powers of the air cannot be considered to be mere illusions; but 
even men are able, by some skilful incision, to remove the male organ; 
therefore devils can do invisibly what others do visibly.
        But on the contrary side, S. Augustine (de Ciuitate Dei, XVIII) 
says: It is not to be believed that, through the art or power of devils, 
man's body can be changed into the likeness of a beast; therefore it is 
equally impossible that that should be removed which is essential to the 
truth of the human body, Also he says (de Trinitate, III): It must not be 
thought that this substance of visible matter is subject to the will of 
those fallen angels; for it is subject only to God.
        Answer. There is no doubt that certain witches can do marvellous 
things with regard to male organs, for this agrees with what has been seen 
and heard by many, and with the general account of what has been known 
concerning that member through the senses of sight and touch. And as to how 
this thing is possible, it is to be said that it can be done in two ways, 
either actually and in fact, as the first arguments have said, or through 
some prestige or glamour. But when it is performed by witches, it is only a 
matter of glamour; although it is no illusion in the opinion of the 
sufferer. For his imagination can really and actually believe that something 
is not present, since by none of his exterior sense, such as sight or touch, 
can he perceive that it is present.
        From this it may be said that there is a true abstraction of the 
member in imagination, although not in fact; and several things are to be 
noted as to how this happens. And first as to two methods by which it can be 
done. It is no wonder that the devil can deceive the outer human senses, 
since, as has been treated of above, he can illude the inner senses, by 
bringing to actual perception ideas that are stored in the imagination. 
Moreover, he deceives men in their natural functions, causing that which is 
visible to be invisible to them, and that which is tangible to be 
intangible, and the audible inaudible, and so with the other senses. But 
such things are not true in actual fact, since they are caused through some 
defect introduced in the sense, such as the eyes or the ears, or the touch, 
by reason of which defect a man's judgement is deceived.
        And we can illustrate this from certain natural phenomena. For sweet 
wine appears bitter on the tongue of the fevered, his taste being deceived 
not by the actual fact, but through his disease. So also in the case under 
consideration, the deception is not due to fact, since the member is still 
actually in its place; but it is an illusion of the sense with regard to it.
        Again, as has been said above concerning the generative powers, the 
devil can obstruct that action by imposing some other body of the same 
colour and appearance, in such a way that some smoothly fashioned body in 
the colour of flesh is interposed between the sight and touch, and between 
the true body of the sufferer, so that it seems to him that he can see and 
feel nothing but a smooth body with its surface interrupted by no genital 
organ. See the sayings of S. Thomas (2 dist. 8. artic. 5) concerning 
glamours and illusions, and also in the second of the second, 91, and in his 
questions concerning Sin; where he frequently quotes that of S. Augustine in 
Book LXXXIII: This evil of the devil creeps in through all the sensual 
approaches; he gives himself to figures, he adapts himself to colours, he 
abides in sounds, he lurks in smells, he infuses himself into flavours.
        Besides, it is to be considered that such an illusion of the sight 
and touch can be caused not only by the interposition of some smooth 
unmembered body, but also by the summoning to the fancy or imagination of 
certain forms and ideas latent in the mind, in such a way that a thing is 
imagined as being perceived then for the first time. For, as was shown in 
the preceding question, devils can by their own power change bodies locally; 
and just as the disposition or humour can be affected in this way, so can 
the natural functions. I speak of things which appear natural to the 
imagination or senses. For Aristotle in the de Somno et Uigila says, 
assigning the cause of apparitions in dreams, that when an animal sleeps 
much blood flows to the inner consciousness, and thence come ideas or 
impressions derived from actual previous experiences stored in the mind. It 
has already been defined how thus certain appearance convey the impressions 
of new experiences. And since this can happen naturally, much more can the 
devil call to the imagination the appearance of a smooth body unprovided 
with the virile member, in such a way that the sense believe it to be an 
actual fact.
        Secondly, some other methods are to be noted which are easier to 
understand and to explain. For, according to S. Isidore (Etym. VIII, 9), a 
glamour is nothing but a certain delusion of the senses, and especially of 
the eyes. And for this reason it is also called a prestige, from prestringo, 
since the sight of the eyes is so fettered that things seem to be other than 
they are. And Alexander of Hales, Part 2, says that a prestige, properly 
understood, is an illusion of the devil, which is not caused by any change 
in matter, but only exists in the mind of him who is deluded, either as to 
his inner or outer perceptions.
        Wherefore, in a manner of speaking, we may say even of human 
prestidigitatory art, that it can be effected in three ways. For the first, 
it can be done without devils, since it is artificially done by the agility 
of men who show things and conceal them, as in the case of the tricks of 
conjurers and ventriloquists. The second method is also without the help of 
devils; as when men can use some natural virtue in natural bodies or 
minerals so as to impart to such objects some other appearance quite 
different from their true appearance. Wherefore, according to S. Thomas (I, 
114, 4), and several others, men, by the smoke of certain smouldering or 
lighted herbs, can make rods appear to be serpents.
        The third method of delusion is effected with the help of devils, 
the permission of God being granted. For it is clear that devils have, of 
their nature, some power over certain earthly matters, which they exercise 
upon them, when God permits, so that things appear to be other than they 
are.
        And as to this third method, it is to be noted that the devil has 
fives ways in which he can delude anyone so that he thinks a thing to be 
other than it is. First, by an artificial tricks, as has been said; for that 
which a man can do by art, the devil can do even better. Second, by a 
natural method, by the application, as has been said, and interposition of 
some substance so as to hide the true body, or by confusing it in man's 
fancy. The third way is when in an assumed body he presents himself as being 
something which he is not; as witness the story which S. Gregory tells in 
his First Dialogue of a Nun, who ate a lettuce, which, however, as the devil 
confessed, was not a lettuce, but the devil in the form of a lettuce, or in 
the lettuce itself. Or as when he appeared to S. Antony in a lump of gold 
which he found in the desert. Or as when he touches a real man, and makes 
him appear like a brute animal, as will shortly be explained. The fourth 
method is when he confuses the organ of sight, so that a clear thing seems 
hazy, or the converse, or when an old woman appears to be a young girl. For 
even after weeping the light appears different from what it was before. His 
fifth method is by working in the imaginative power, and, by a disturbance 
of the humours, effecting a transmutation in the forms perceived by the 
senses, as has been treated of before, so that the senses then perceive as 
it were fresh and new images. And accordingly, by the last three of these 
methods, and even by the second, the devil can cast a glamour over the 
senses of a man. Wherefore there is no difficulty in his concealing the 
virile member by some prestige or glamour. And a manifest proof or example 
of this, which was revealed to us in our Inquisitorial capacity, will be set 
forth later, where more is recounted of these and other matters in the 
Second Part of this Treatise. 

How a Bewitchment can be Distinguished from a Natural Defect.

        An incidental question, with certain other difficulties, follows. 
Peter's member has been taken off, and he does not know whether it is by 
witchcraft or in some other way by the devil's power, with the permission of 
God. Are there any ways of determining or distinguishing between these? It 
can be answered as follows. First, that those to whom such things most 
commonly happen are adulterers or fornicators. For when they fail to respond 
to the demand of their mistress, or if they wish to desert them and attach 
themselves to other women, then their mistress, out of vengeance, through 
some other power causes their members to be taken off. Secondly, it can be 
distinguished by the fact that it is not permanent. For if it is not due to 
witchcraft, then the loss is not permanent, but it will be restored some 
time.
        But here there arises another doubt, whether it is due to the nature 
of the witchcraft that it is not permanent. It is answered that it can be 
permanent, and last until death, just as the Canonists and Theologians judge 
concerning the impediment of witchcraft in matrimony, that the temporary can 
become permanent. For Godfrey says in his Summa: A bewitchment cannot always 
be removed by him who caused it, either because he is dead, or because he 
does not know how to remove it, or because the charm has been lost. 
Wherefore we may say in the same way that the charm which has been worked on 
Peter will be permanent if the witch who did it cannot heal him.
        For there are three degrees of witches. For some both heal and harm; 
some harm, but cannot heal; and some seem able only to heal, that is, to 
take away injuries, as will be shown later. For thus it happened to us: Two 
witches were quarreling, and while they were taunting each other one said: I 
am not so wicked as you, for I know how to heal those whom I injure. The 
charm will also be permanent if, before it has been healed, the witch 
departs, either by changing her dwelling or by dying. For S. Thomas also 
says: Any charm may be permanent when it is such as can have no human 
remedy; or if it has a remedy, it is not known to men, or unlawful; although 
God can find a remedy through a holy Angel who can coerce the devil, if not 
the witch.
        However, the chief remedy against witchcraft is the sacrament of 
Penitence. For bodily infirmity often proceeds from sin. And how the charms 
or witches can be removed will be shown in the Second Part of this Treatise, 
and in the Second QUestion, chapter VI, where other different matters are 
treated of and explained. 

Solutions of the Arguments.

        For the first, it is clear that there is no doubt but that, just as, 
with God's permission, they can kill men, so also can devils taken off that 
member, as well as others, truly and actually. But then the devils do not 
work through the medium of witches, concerning which mention has already 
been made. And from this the answer to the second argument is also made 
clear. But this is to be said: that God allows more power of witchcraft over 
the genital forces because, etc.; and therefore even allows that that member 
should be truly and actually taken off. But it is not valid to say that this 
always happens. For it would not be after the manner of witchcraft for it to 
happen so; and even the witches, when they do such works, do not pretend 
that they have not the power to restore the member when they wish to and 
know how to do so. From which it is clear that it is not actually taken off, 
but only by a glamour. As for the third, concerning the metamorphosis of 
Lot's wife, we say that this was actual, and not a glamour. And as to the 
fourth, that devils can create certain substantial shapes, and therefore can 
also remove them: it is to be said with regard to Pharaoh's magicians that 
they made true serpents; and that devils can, with the help of another 
agent, produce certain effects on imperfect creatures which they cannot on 
men, who are God's chief care. For it is said: Does God care for oxen? They 
can, nevertheless, with the permission of God, do to men true and actual 
harm, as also they can create a glamour of harm, and by this the answer to 
the last argument is made clear. 




Question X  Whether Witches can by some Glamour Change Men into Beasts.  

        Here we declare the truth as to whether and how witches transform 
men into beasts. And it is argued that this is not possible, from the 
following passage of Episcopus (XXVI, 5): Whoever believes that it is 
possible for any creature to be changed for the better or for the worse, or 
to be transformed into any other shape or likeness, except by the Creator 
Himself, Who made all things, is without doubt an infidel, and worse than a 
pagan.
        And we will quote the arguments of S. Thomas in the 2nd Book of 
Sentences, VIII: Whether devils can affect the bodily sense by the delusion 
of a glamour. There he argues first that they cannot. For though that shape 
of a beast which is seen must be somewhere, it cannot exist only in the 
senses; for the sense perceive no shape that is not received from actual 
matter, and there is no actual beast there; and he adduces the authority of 
the Canon. And again, that which seems to be, cannot really be; as in the 
case of a woman who seems to be a beast, for two substantial shapes cannot 
exist at one and the same time in the same matter. Therefore, since that 
shape of a beast which appears cannot exist anywhere, no glamour or illusion 
can exist in the eye of the beholder; for the sight must have some object in 
which it terminates.
        And if it is argued that the shape exists in the surrounding 
atmosphere, this is not possible; both because the atmosphere is not capable 
of taking any shape or form, and also because the air around that person is 
not always constant, and cannot be so on account of its fluid nature, 
especially when it is moved. And again because in that case such a 
transformation would be visible to everyone; but this is not so, because the 
devils seem to be unable to deceive the sight of Holy Men in the least.
        Besides, the sense of sight, or the faculty of vision, is a passive 
faculty, and every passive faculty is set in motion by the active agent that 
corresponds to it. Now the active agent corresponding to sight is twofold: 
one is the origin of the act, or the object; the other is the carrier, or 
medium. But that apparent shape cannot be the object of the sense, neither 
can it be the medium through which it is carried. First, it cannot be the 
object, since it cannot be taken hold of by anything, as was shown in the 
foregoing argument, since it does not exist in the senses received from an 
object, neither is it in the actual object, nor even in the air, as in a 
carrying medium, as was treated of above in the third argument.
        Besides, if the devil moves the inner consciousness, he does so 
either by projecting himself into the cognitive faculty, or by changing it. 
But he does not do so by projecting himself; for he would either have to 
assume a body, and even so could not penetrate into the inner organ of 
imagination; for two bodies cannot be at the same time in the same place; or 
he would assume a phantasmal body; and this again would be impossible, since 
no phantasm is quite without substance.
        Similarly also he cannot do it by changing the cognition. For he 
would either change it by alteration, which he does not seem able to do, 
since all alteration is caused by active qualities, in which the devils are 
lacking; or he would change it by transformation or local motion; and this 
does not seem feasible for two reasons. First, because a transformation or 
an organ cannot be effect without a sense of pain. Secondly, because in this 
case the devil would only make things of a known shape appear; but S. 
Augustine says that he creates shapes of this sort, both known and unknown. 
Therefore it seems that the devils can in no way deceive the imagination or 
senses of a man.
        But against this, S. Augustine says (de Ciuitate Dei, XVIII) that 
the transmutations of men into brute animals, said to be done by the art of 
devils, are not actual but only apparent. But this would not be possible if 
devils were not able to transmute the human senses. The authority of S. 
Augustine is again to the point in Book LXXXIII, which has already been 
quoted: This evil of the devil creeps in through all the sensual approaches, 
etc.
        Answer. If the reader wishes to refer to the method of 
transmutation, he will find in the Second Part of this work, chapter VI, 
various methods. But proceeding for the present in a scholastic manner, let 
us say in agreement with the opinions of the three Doctors, that the devil 
can deceive the human fancy so that a man really seems to be an animal. The 
last of those opinions, which is that of S. Thomas, is more subtle than the 
rest. But the first is that of S. Antoninus in the first part of his Summa, 
V, 5, where he declares that the devil at times works to deceive a man's 
fancy, especially by an illusion of the senses; and he proves this by 
natural reasoning, by the authority of the Canon, and by a great number of 
examples.
        And at first as follows: Our bodies naturally are subject to and 
obey the angelic nature as regards local motion. But the bad angels, 
although the have lost grace, have not lost their natural power, as has 
often been said before. And since the faculty of fancy or imagination is 
corporeal, that is, allied to a physical organ, it also is naturally subject 
to devils, so that they can transmute it, causing various phantasies, by the 
flow of the thoughts and perceptions to the original image received by them. 
So says S. Antoninus, and adds that it is proved by the following Canon 
(Episcopus, XXVI, 5): It must not be omitted that certain wicked women, 
perverted by Satan and seduced by the illusions and phantasms of devils, 
believe and profess that they ride in the night hours on certain beasts with 
Diana, the heathen goddess, or with Herodias, and with a countless number of 
women, and that in the untimely silence of night they travel over great 
distances of land. And later: Wherefore priests ought to preach to the 
people of God that they should know this to be altogether false, and that 
when such phantasms afflict the minds of the faithful, it is not of God, but 
of an evil spirit. For Satan himself transforms himself into the shape and 
likeness of different persons, and in dreams deluding the mind which he 
holds captive, leads it through devious ways.
        Indeed the meaning of this Canon has been treated of in the First 
Question, as to the four things which are to be preached. But it would be to 
misunderstand its meaning to maintain that witches cannot be so transported, 
when they wish and God does not prevent it; for very often men who are not 
witches are unwillingly transported bodily over great distances of land.
        But that these transmutations can be effected in both ways will be 
shown by the aforesaid Summa, and in the chapter where S. Augustine relates 
that it is read in the books of the Gentiles that a certain sorceress named 
Circe changed the companions of Ulysses into beasts; but that this was due 
to some glamour or illusion, rather than an actual accomplishment, by 
altering the fancies of men; and this is clearly proved by several examples.
        For we read in the Lives of the Fathers, that a certain girl would 
not consent to a young man who was begging her to commit a shameful act with 
him. And the young man, being angry because of this, caused a certain Jew to 
work a charm against her, by which she was changed into a filly. But this 
metamorphosis was not an actual fact, but an illusion of the devil, who 
changed the fancy and sense of the girl herself, and of those who looked at 
her, so that she seemed to be a filly, who was really a girl. For when she 
was led to the Blessed Macarius, the devil could not so work as to deceive 
his senses as he had those of other people, on account of his sanctity; for 
to him she seemed a true girl, not a filly. And at length by his prayer she 
was set free from that illusion, and it is said that this had happened to 
her because she did not give her mind to holy things, or attend the 
Sacraments as she ought; therefore the devil had power over her, although 
she was in other respects honest.
        Therefore the devil can, by moving the inner perceptions and 
humours, effect changes in the actions and faculties, physical, mental, and 
emotional, working by means of any physical organ soever; and this accords 
with S. Thomas, I, 91. And of this sort we may believe to have been the acts 
of Simon Magus in the incantations which are narrated of him. But the devil 
can do none of these things without the permission of God, Who with His good 
Angels often restrains the wickedness of him who seeks to deceive and hurt 
us. Wherefore S. Augustine, speaking of witches, says: These are they who, 
with the permission of God, stir up the elements, and confuse the minds of 
those who do not trust in God (XXVI, 5).
        Also devils can by witchcraft cause a man to be unable to see his 
wife rightly, and the converse. And this comes from an affectation of the 
fancy, so that she is represented to him as an odious and horrible thing. 
The devil also suggests representations of loathsome things to the fancy of 
both the waking and the sleeping, to deceive them and lead them to son. But 
because sin does not consist in the imagination but in the will, therefore 
man does not sin in these fancies suggested by the devil, and these various 
transformations, unless of his own will he consents to sin.
        The second opinion of the modern Doctors is to the same effect, when 
they declare what is glamour, and how many ways the devil can cause such 
illusions. Here we refer to what has already been said concerning the 
arguments of S. Antoninus, which there is no need to repeat.
        The third opinion is that of S. Thomas, and is an answer to the 
argument where it is asked, Wherein lies the existence of the shape of a 
beast that is seen; in the senses, or in reality, or in the surrounding air? 
And his opinion is that the apparent shape of a beast only exists in the 
inner perception, which, through the force of imagination, sees it in some 
way as an exterior object. And the devil has two ways of effecting such a 
result.
        In one way we may say that the forms of animals which are conserved 
in the treasury of the imagination pass by the operation of the devil into 
the organs of inner senses; and in this way it happens in dreams, as has 
been declared above. And so, when these forms are impressed on the organs of 
the outer senses, such as sight, they appear as if they were present as 
outer objects, and could actually be touched.
        The other way results from a change in the inner organs of 
perception, through which the judgement is deceived; as is shown in the case 
of him who has his taste corrupted, so that everything sweet seems bitter; 
and this is not very different from the first method. Moreover, even men can 
accomplish this by the virtue of certain natural things, as when in the 
vapour of a certain smoke the beams of a house appear to be serpents; and 
many other instances of this are found, as had been mentioned above. 

Solutions of the Arguments.

        As to the first argument, that text is often quoted, but it is badly 
understood. For as to where it speaks of transformation into another shape 
or likeness, it has been made clear how this can be done by prestidigitatory 
art. And as to where it says that no creature can be made by the power of 
the devil, this is manifestly true if Made is understood to mean Created. 
But if the word Made is taken to refer to natural production, it is certain 
that devils can make some imperfect creatures. And S. Thomas shows how this 
may be done. For he says that all transmutations of bodily matters which can 
be effected by the forces of nature, in which the essential thing is the 
semen which is found in the elements of this world, on land or in the waters 
(as serpents and frogs and such things deposit their semen), can be effected 
by the work of devils who have acquired such semen. So also it is when 
anything is changed into serpents or frogs, which can be generated by 
putrefaction.
        But those transmutations of bodily matters which cannot be effected 
by the forces of nature can in no way be truly effected by the work of the 
devils. For when the body of a man is changed into the body of a beast, or a 
dead body is brought to life, such things only seem to happen, and are a 
glamour or illusion; or else the devil appears before men in an assumed 
body.
        These arguments are substantiated. For Blessed Albertus in his book 
On Animals, where he examines whether devils, or let us even say witches, 
can really make animals, says that they can, with God's permission, make 
imperfect animals. But they cannot do so in an instant, as God does, but by 
means of some motion, however sudden, as is clear in the case of witches. 
And touching the passage in Exodus vii, where Pharao called his wise men, he 
says: The devils run throughout the world and collect various germs, and by 
using them can evolve various species. And the gloss thereon says: When 
witches attempt to effect anything by the invocation of devils, they run 
about the world and bring the semen of those things which are in question, 
and by its means, with the permission of God, they produce new species. But 
this has been spoken of above.
        Another difficulty may arise, whether such devils' works are to be 
deemed miraculous. The answer was made clear in the preceding arguments, 
that even the devils can perform certain miracles to which their natural 
powers are adapted. And although such things are true in fact, they are not 
done with a view to the knowledge of the truth; and in this sense the works 
of Antichrist may be said to be deceptions, since they are done with a view 
to the seduction of men.
        The answer to the other argument, that concerning the shape, is also 
clear. The shape of a beast which is seen does not exist in the air, but 
only in the perception of the senses, as has been demonstrated above from 
the opinion of S. Thomas.
        For the argument that every passive is set in motion by its 
corresponding active, this is granted. But when it is inferred that the 
shape which is seen cannot be the original object which sets in motion the 
act of sight, since it arises from none of the sense, it is answered that it 
does not arise, since it originates from some sensible image conserved in 
the imagination, which the devil can draw out and present to the imagination 
or power of perception, as has been said above.
        For the last argument, it is to be said that the devil does not, as 
has been shown, change the perceptive and imaginative powers by projecting 
himself into them, but by transmuting them; not indeed by altering them, 
except in respect of local motion. For he cannot of himself induce new 
appearances, as has been said. But he changes them by transmutation, that 
is, local motion. And this again he does, not by dividing the substance of 
the organ of perception, since that would result in a sense of pain, but by 
a movement of the perceptions and humours.

        But it may be further objected as follows: that according to this 
the devil cannot present to a man the appearance of anything new in respect 
of things seen. It is to be said that a new thing can be understood in two 
ways. In once way it may be entirely new both in itself and its beginnings; 
and in this sense the devil cannot present anything new to a man's sense of 
vision: for he cannot cause one who is born blind to imagine colours, or a 
deaf man to imagine sounds. In another sense, a thing may be new as to the 
composition of its whole; as we may say that it is an imaginatively new 
thing if a man imagines that he sees mountain of gold, which he never saw; 
for he has seen gold, and he has seen a mountain, and can by some natural 
operation imagine the phantasm of a mountain of gold. And in this way the 
devil can present a new thing to the imagination. 

What is to be Thought of Wolves which sometimes Seize and Eat Men and 
Children out of their Cradles: whether this also is a Glamour caused by 
Witches.

        There is incidentally a question concerning wolves, which sometimes 
snatch men and children out of their houses and eat them, and run about with 
such astuteness that by no skill or strength can they be hurt or captured. 
It is to be said that this sometimes has a natural cause, but is sometimes 
due to a glamour, when it is effected by witches. And as to the first, 
Blessed Albertus in his book On Animals says that it can arise from five 
causes. Sometimes on account of great famine, when stags and other beasts 
have come near to men. Sometimes on account of the fierceness of their 
strength, as in the case of dogs in cold regions. But this is nothing to the 
point; and we say that such things are caused by an illusion of devils, when 
God punishes some nation for sin. See Leviticus xxvi: If ye do not my 
commandments, I will send the beasts of the field against you, who shall 
consume you and your flocks. And again Deuteronomy xxxii: I will also send 
the teeth of beast upon them, etc.
        As to the question whether they are true wolves, or devils appearing 
in that shape, we say that they are true wolves, but are possessed by 
devils; and they are so roused up in two ways. It may happen without the 
operation of witches: and so it was in the case of the two-and-forty boys 
who were devoured by two bears coming out of the woods, because they mocked 
the prophet Elisaus, saying, Go up, thou bald head, etc. Also in the case of 
the lion which slew the prophet who would not perform the commandment of God 
(III. Kings xiii). And it is told that a Bishop of Vienna ordered the minor 
Litanies to be solemnly chanted on certain days before the Feast of the 
Ascension, because wolves were entering the city and publicly devouring men.
        But in another way it may be an illusion caused by witches. For 
William of Paris tells of a certain man who thought that he was turned into 
a wolf, and at certain times went hiding among the caves. For there he went 
at a certain time, and though he remained there all the time stationary, he 
believed that he was a wolf which went about devouring children; and though 
the devil, having possessed a wolf, was really doing this, he erroneously 
thought that he was prowling about in his sleep. And he was for so long thus 
out of his senses that he was at last found lying in the wood raving. The 
devil delights in such things, and caused the illusion of the pagans who 
believed that men and old women were changed into beasts. From this it is 
seen that such things only happen by the permission of God along and through 
the operation of devils, and not through any natural defect; since by no art 
or strength can such wolves be injured or captured. In this connexion also 
Vincent of Beauvais (in Spec. Hist., VI, 40) tells that in Gaul, before the 
Incarnation of Christ, and before the Punic War, a wolf snatched a sentry's 
sword out of its sheath. 




Question XI  That Witches who are Midwives in Various Ways Kill the Child 
Conceived in the Womb, and Procure an Abortion; or if they do not this Offer 
New-born Children to Devils.  

        Here is set forth the truth concerning four horrible crimes which 
devils commit against infants, both in the mother's womb and afterwards. And 
since the devils do these things through the medium of women, and not men, 
this form of homicide is associated rather with women than with men, And the 
following are the methods by which it is done.
        The Canonists treat more fully than the Theologians of the 
obstructions due to witchcraft; and they say that is is witchcraft, not only 
when anyone is unable to perform the carnal act, of which we have spoken 
above; but also when a woman is prevented from conceiving, or is made to 
miscarry after she has conceived. A third and fourth method of witchcraft is 
when they have failed to procure an abortion, and then either devour the 
child or offer it to a devil.
        There is no doubt concerning the first two methods, since, without 
the help of devils, a man can by natural means, such as herbs, savin for 
example, or other emmenagogues, procure that a woman cannot generate or 
conceive, as has bee mentioned above. But with the other two methods it is 
different; for they are effected by witches. And there is no need to bring 
forward the arguments, since very evident instances and examples will more 
readily show the truth of this matter.
        The former of these two abominations is the fact that certain 
witches, against the instinct of human nature, and indeed against the nature 
of all beasts, with the possible exception of wolves, are in the habit of 
devouring and eating infant children. And concerning this, the Inquisitor of 
Como, who has been mentioned before, has told us the following: that he was 
summoned by the inhabitants of the County of Barby to hold an inquisition, 
because a certain man had missed his child from its cradle, and finding a 
congress of women in the night-time, swore that he saw them kill his child 
and drink its blood and devour it. Also, in one single year, which is the 
year now last passed, he says that forty-one witches were burned, certain 
others taking flight to the Lord Archduke of Austria, Sigismund. For 
confirmation of this there are certain writings of John Nider in his 
Formicarius, of whom, as of those events which he recounts, the memory is 
still fresh in men's minds; wherefore it is apparent that such things are 
not incredible. We must add that in all these matters witch midwives cause 
yet greater injuries, as penitent witches have often told to us and to 
others, saying: No one does more harm to the Catholic Faith than midwives. 
For when they do not kill children, then, as if for some other purpose, they 
take them out of the room and, raising them up in the air, offer them to 
devils. But the method which they observe in crimes of this sort will be 
shown in the Second Part, which we must soon approach. But first one more 
question must be inquired into, namely, that of the Divine permission. For 
it was said at the beginning that three things are necessary for the 
effecting of witchcraft: the devil, a witch, and the Divine permission. 



Question XII  Whether the Permission of Almighty God is an Accompaniment of 
Witchcraft.  

        Now we must consider the Divine permission itself, touching which 
four things are asked. First, whether it is necessary that this permission 
should accompany a work of witchcraft. Secondly, that God in His justice 
permits a creature naturally sinful to perpetrate witchcraft and other 
horrid crimes, the other two necessary concomitants being presupposed. 
Thirdly, that the crime of witchcraft exceeds all other evils which God 
permits to be done. Fourthly, in what way this matter should be preached to 
the people.
        Concerning the third postulate of this First Part, namely, the 
Divine permission, it is asked: Whether it is as Catholic to affirm the 
Divine permission in these works of witches, as it is quite heretical to 
contradict such an affirmation? And it is argued that it is not heretical to 
maintain that God does not permit so great power to the devil in this sort 
of witchcraft. For it is Catholic, and not heretical, to refute such things 
as appear to be to the disparagement of the Creator. And it is submitted 
that it is Catholic to maintain that the devil is not allowed such power of 
injuring men, since to hold the opposite opinion seems to be a disparagement 
of the Creator. For it would then follow that not everything is subject to 
the Divine providence, since the all-wise Provider keeps away, as far as 
possible, all defect and evil from those for whom He cares. And if the works 
of witchcraft are permitted by God, they are not kept away by Him: and if He 
does not keep them away, the God Himself is not a wise Provider, and all 
things are not subject to His providence. But since this is false, therefore 
it is false that God permits witchcraft.
        And again, to permit a thing to happen presupposes in him who 
permits it that either he can prevent it from happening if he wishes, or he 
cannot prevent it even if he wishes; and neither of these suppositions can 
apply to God. For in the first case, such a man would be thought spiteful, 
and in the second case impotent. Then it is incidentally asked: As to that 
bewitchment that happened to Peter, if God could have prevented it, and did 
not do so, then God is either despiteful or He does not care for all; but if 
He could not have prevented it even if He wished, the He is not omnipotent. 
But since it is not possible to maintain the opinion that God does not care 
for all, and the rest, therefore it cannot be said that witchcraft is done 
with the permission of God.
        Besides, he who is responsible to himself and is the master of his 
own actions is not subject to the permission or providence of any governor. 
But men were made responsible to themselves by God, according to 
Ecclesiasticus xv: God made man from the beginning, and left him in the hand 
of his counsel. In particular, the sins which men do are left in their own 
counsel, according to their hearts' desire. Therefore not all evils are 
subject to Divine permission.
        Yet again, S. Augustine says in the Enchiridion, as does also 
Aristotle in the ninth book of Metaphysics: It is better not to know certain 
vile things than to know them, but all that is good is to be ascribed to 
God. Therefore God does not prevent the very vile works of witchcraft, 
whether He permits or not. See also S. Paul in I. Corinthians ix: Doth God 
take care of oxen? And the same holds good of the other irrational beasts. 
Wherefore God takes no care whether they are bewitched or not, since they 
are not subject to His permission, which proceeds from His providence.
        Again, that which happens of necessity has no need of provident 
permission or prudence. This is clearly shown in Aristotle's Ethics, Book 
II: Prudence is a right reasoning concerning things which happen and are 
subject to counsel and choice. But several effects of witchcraft happen of 
necessity; as when for some reason, or owing to the influence of stars, 
diseases come, or any other things which we judge to be witchcraft. 
Therefore they are not always subject to Divine permission.
        And again, if men are bewitched by Divine permission, then it is 
asked: Why does this happen to one more than to another? If it be said that 
it is because of sin, which abounds more in one than in another, this does 
not seem valid; for then the greater sinners would be the more bewitched, 
but this is manifestly not so, since they are less punished in this world. 
As it is said: Well is it for the liars. But, if this argument were good, 
they also would be bewitched. Finally, it is clear from the fact that 
innocent children and other just men suffer most from witchcraft.
        But against these arguments: it is submitted that God permits evil 
to be done, though He does not wish it; and this is for the perfecting of 
the universe. See Dionysius, de Diuin. Nom. III: Evil will be for all time, 
even to the perfecting of the universe. And S. Augustine in the Enchiridion: 
In all things good and evil consists the admirable beauty of the universe. 
So that what is said to be evil is well ordained, and kept in its due place 
commends more highly that which is good; for good things are more pleasing 
and laudable when compared with bad. S. Thomas also refutes the opinion of 
those who say that, although God has no wish for evil (since no creature 
seeks for evil, either in its natural, or its animal, or in its intellectual 
appetite, which is the will, whose object is good), yet He is willing that 
evil should exist and be done. This he says to be false; since God neither 
wishes evil to be done, nor wishes it not to be done, but is willing to 
allow evil to be done; and this is good for the perfecting of the universe.
        And why it is erroneous to say that God wishes evil to be and to be 
done, for the good of the universe, he says is for the following reason. 
Nothing is to be judged good except what is good in itself and not by 
accident. As the virtuous man is judge good in his intellectual nature, not 
in his animal nature. But evil is not of itself ordained for good, but by 
accident. For against the intention of those who do evil, good results. In 
this way, against the intention of witches, or against the intention of 
tyrants, was it that through their persecutions the patience of the martyrs 
shone out clearly.
        Answer. This question is as difficult to understand as it is 
profitable to elucidate. For there is among the arguments, not so much of 
Laymen as of certain Wise men, this in common; that they do not believe that 
such horrible witchcraft as had been spoken of is permitted by God; being 
ignorant of the causes of this Divine permission. And by reason of this 
ignorance, since witches are not put down with the vengeance that is due to 
them, they seem now to be depopulating the whole of Christianity. Therefore 
that both learned and unlearned may be satisfied in each way, according to 
the opinion of the Theologians, we make our answer by the discussion of two 
difficulties. And first, that he world is so subject to the Divine 
providence that He Himself provides for all. Secondly, that in His justice 
He permits the prevalence of sin, which consists of guilt, punishment, and 
loss, by reason of His two first permissions, namely, the fall of the Angels 
and that of our first parents. From which also it will be clear that 
obstinately to disbelieve this smacks of heresy, since such a man implicates 
himself in the errors of the infidels.
        And as for the first, it is to be noted that, presupposing that 
which pertains to the providence of God (see Wisdom xiv: Thy providence, O 
Father, governeth all things), we ought also to maintain that all things are 
subject to His providence, and that also He immediately provides for all 
things. And to make this clear, let us first refute a certain contrary 
error. For taking the text in Job xxii: Thick clouds are a covering to him 
that He seeth not us; and He walketh in the circuit of heaven: some have 
thought that the doctrine pf S. Thomas, I, 22, means that only incorruptible 
things are subject to Divine providence, such as the separate Essences, and 
the stars, with also the species of lower things, which are also 
incorruptible; but they said that the individuals of the species, being 
corruptible, were not so subject. Wherefore they said that all lower things 
which are in the world are subject to Divine providence in the universal, 
but not in the particular or individual sense. But to others this opinion 
did not seem tenable, since God cares for the other animals just as He does 
for men. Therefore the Rabbi Moses, wishing to hold a middle course, agreed 
with their opinion in saying that all corruptible things are not 
individually entirely subject to Divine governance, but only in a universal 
sense, as has been said before; but he excepted men from the generality of 
corruptible things, because of the splendid nature of their intellect, which 
is comparable with the of the separate Essences. And so, according to his 
opinion, whatever witchcraft happens to men comes from the Divine 
permission; but not such as happens to the animals or to the other fruits of 
the earth.
        Now though this opinion is nearer to the truth than that which 
altogether denies the providence of God in worldly matters, maintaining that 
the world was made by chance, as did Democritus and the Epicureans, yet it 
is not without great fallacy. For it must be said that everything is subject 
to Divine providence, not only in the general, but also in the particular 
sense; and that the bewitching not only of men, but also of animals and the 
fruits of the earth, comes from Divine and provident permission. And this is 
plainly true; the providence and ordinance of things to some end extend just 
so far as the causality of them itself extends. To take an example from 
things that are subject to some master; they are so far subject to his 
providence as they are themselves under his control. But the causality which 
is of God is the original agent, and extends itself to all beings, not only 
in a general but also in an individual sense, and not only to things 
incorruptible. Therefore, since all things must be of God, so all things are 
cared for by Him, that is, are ordained to some end.
        This point is touched by S. Paul in Romans xiii: All things which 
are from God were ordained by Him. Which is to say that, just as all things 
come from God, so also are all things ordained by Him, and are consequently 
subject to His providence. For the providence of God is to be understood as 
nothing else than the reason, that is, the cause of the ordering of things 
to a purpose. Therefore, in so far as all things are a part of one purpose, 
so also are they subject to the providence of God. And God knows all things, 
not only in the mass generally, but also in the individual particularly. Now 
the knowledge which God has of things created is to be compared with a 
craftsman's knowledge of his work: therefore, just as all his work is 
subject to the order and providence of a craftsman, so are all things 
subject to the order and providence of God.
        But this does not provide a satisfactory explanation of the fact 
that God in justice permits evil and witchcraft to be in the world, although 
He is Himself the provider and governor of all things; for it would seem 
that, if this is conceded, He ought to keep away all evil from those for 
whom He cares. For we see among men that a wise provider does all that he 
can to keep away all defect and harm from those who are his care; therefore 
why does not God, in the same way, keep away all evil? It must be noted that 
a particular and an universal controller or provider are two very different 
matters. For the particular controller must of necessity keep away all the 
harm he can, since he is not able to extract good out of evil. But God is 
the universal controller of the whole world, and can extract much good from 
particular evils; as through the persecution of the tyrants came the 
patience of the martyrs, and through the works of witches come the purgation 
or proving of the faith of the just, as will be shown. Therefore it is not 
God's purpose to prevent all evil, lest the universe should lack the cause 
of much good. Wherefore S. Augustine says in the Enchiridion: So merciful is 
Almighty God, that He would not allow any evil to be in His works unless He 
were so omnipotent and good that He can bring good even out of evil.
        And we have an example of this in the actions of natural things. For 
although the corruptions and defects which occur in natural things are 
contrary to the purpose of that particular thing (as when a thief is hanged, 
or when animals are killed for human food), they are yet in accordance with 
the universal purpose of nature (as that man's life and property should be 
kept intact); and thus the universal good is preserved. For it is necessary 
for the conservation of the species that the death of one should be the 
preservation of another. For lions are kept alive by the slaughter of other 
animals. 

It is explained with regard to the Divine Permission, that God would not 
make a Creature to be Naturally without Sin.

        Secondly, God in His justice permits the prevalence of evil, both 
that of sin and that of pain, and especially now that the world is cooling 
and declining to its end; and this we shall prove from two propositions 
which must be postulated. First, that God would not - or let us rather say, 
with the fear of God, that (humanly speaking) it is impossible that any 
creature, man or Angel, can be of such a nature that it cannot sin. And 
secondly, that it is just in God to permit man to sin, or to be tempted. 
These two propositions being granted, and since it is a part of the Divine 
providence that every creature shall be left to its own nature, it must be 
said that, according to the premises, it is impossible that God does not 
permit witchcraft to be committed with the help of devils.
        And that it was not possible to communicate to a creature a natural 
incapacity for sin, is shown by S. Thomas (II, 23, art. 1). For if this 
quality were communicable to any creature, God would have communicated it; 
for He has, at least in kind, communicated all other graces and perfections 
to His creatures that are communicable. Such is the personal union of two 
natures in Christ, the Maternity and Virginity of Immaculate MARY, the 
blessed companionship of the elect, and many other things. But we read that 
this quality was not given to any creature, either man or Angel; for it is 
said: Even in His Angels He found sin. Therefore it is certain that God will 
not communicate to man a natural incapacity for sin, although man may win to 
this through grace.
        Again, if this were communicable, and were not communicated, the 
universe would not be perfect. And its perfections consists in the fact that 
all communicable good qualities of creatures are communicated in kind.
        Neither is it valid to argue that God, being omnipotent, and having 
made men and Angels in His likeness, could also have caused his creatures to 
be by nature impeccable: or even that He would make that condition of Grace, 
which is the cause of confirmation in goodness, an essential part of the 
nature of Angels and men, so that through their natural origin and natural 
condition they would be so confirmed in goodness that they would not be able 
to sin.
        For the first argument will not hold. Since, although God is all-
powerful and all-good, yet he will not bestow this quality of impeccability; 
not because of any imperfection in His power, but because of the 
imperfection of the creature; and this imperfection lies chiefly in the fact 
that no creature, man or Angel, is capable of receiving this quality. And 
for this reason: that, being a creature, its being depends upon its Creator, 
just as an effect depends on the cause of its being. And to create is to 
make something out of nothing, and this, if left to itself, perishes, but 
endures so long as it preserves the influence of its cause. You may take, if 
you wish, an example from a candle, which burns only so long as it has wax. 
This being so, it is to be noted that God created man, and left him in the 
hand of his own counsel (Ecclesiasticus xvii). And so also He created the 
Angels in the beginning of Creation. And this was done for the sake of Free-
will, the property of which is to do or to omit doing, to recede or not to 
recede from its cause. And since to recede from God, from free-will, is to 
sin, therefore it was impossible for man or Angel to receive, and God did 
not will to give, such a natural quality that he should at the same time be 
endowed with free-will and also be incapable of sin.
        Another imperfection by reason of which this quality cannot be 
communicated to man or Angel is that it implies a contradiction; and since a 
contradiction is by its nature impossible, we say that God will not do this 
thing. Or rather we should say that His creatures cannot receive such a 
quality. For example, it is impossible that anything can be at one and the 
same time alive and dead. And so it would imply this contradiction: that a 
man should have free-will, by which he would be able to depart from his 
Creator, and that he should also be unable to sin. But if he were unable to 
sin, he would be unable to depart from his Creator. For this is sin: to 
despise the incommutable good and cleave to things that are variable. But to 
despise or not to despise is a matter of free-will.
        The second argument also is not valid. For if the confirmation of 
grace were so essential a part of the original creation that it became a 
natural quality of the creature to be unable to sin, then his inability to 
sin would arise, not from any exterior cause or from grace, but from his own 
very nature; and then he would be God, which is absurd. S. Thomas treats of 
this in his above solution of the last argument, when he says that whenever 
there happens to any creature something that can only be cause by a superior 
influence, the lower nature cannot itself cause that effect without the co-
operation of the higher nature. For example, a gas becomes ignited by fire; 
but it could not of its own nature light itself without fire.
        I say, therefore, that since the confirmation of a rational creature 
comes only through grace, which is a sort of spiritual light or image of the 
light of Creation, it is impossible for any creature to have, of its own 
nature, that confirmation of grace, unless it be made one with the Divine 
nature; that is, unless it be of the same nature as God, which is altogether 
impossible. Let us conclude by saying that the inability to sin belongs by 
nature to God alone. For He does not depart from His nature, Who gives to 
all things their being, neither can He depart from the righteousness of His 
goodness; for this belongs to Him through the character of His nature. But 
for all others who have this quality that they cannot sin, it is conferred 
upon them through the confirmation in goodness by grace; by which the sons 
of God are made free from sin, and they who in any way consort with the 
Divine nature. 




Question XIII  Herein is set forth the Question, concerning the Two Divine 
Permissions which God justly allows, namely, that the Devil, the Author or 
all Evil, should Sin, and that our First Parents should Fall, from which 
Origins the Works of Witches are justly suffered to take place.  

        The second question and proposition is that God justly permitted 
certain Angels to sin in deed, which He could not have allowed unless they 
were capable of sin; and that in like manner He preserved certain creatures 
through grace, without their having previously suffered temptation; and that 
He justly allows man both to be tempted and to sin. And all this is clearly 
shown as follows. For it is a part of Divine providence that each single 
thing should be left to its own nature, and not be altogether impeded in its 
natural works. For, as Dionysius says (de Diuin. Nom., IV), Providence is 
not a destroyer, but a preserver of nature. This being so, it is manifest 
that, just as the good of the race is better than the good of the individual 
(Aristotle, Ethics, I), so also the good of the universe takes precedence 
over the good of any particular creature. Therefore we must add that, if men 
were prevented from sinning, many steps to perfection would be removed. For 
that nature would be removed which has it in its power to sin or not to sin; 
but it has already been shown that this is a natural property of man's 
nature.
        And let it be answered that, if there had been no sin, but immediate 
confirmation, then there would never have appeared what debt of grace in 
good works is due to God, and what the power of sin has been able to effect, 
and many other things without which the universe would suffer great loss. 
For it behoved that Satan should sin, not through some outside suggestion, 
but that he should find in himself the occasion of sin. And this he did when 
he wished to be equal to God. Now this is to be understood neither simply 
and directly, nor indirectly, but only with a reservation; and this is 
declared according to the authority of Esaias xiv: I will ascend above the 
heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High. For it must not be 
understood simply and directly, because in that case he would have had a 
limited and erring understanding, in seeking something which was impossible 
for him. For he knew that he was a creature created by God, and therefore he 
knew that it was impossible for him to become equal to his Creator. Neither, 
again, must it be understood indirectly; for since the whole transparence of 
the air consists in its subjection to the sun's rays; therefore nothing 
which would be contrary to the good of its nature could be sought for by an 
Angel. But he sought for equality with God, not absolutely, but with a 
reservation, which was as follows. The nature of God has two qualities, that 
of blessedness and goodness, and the fact that all the blessedness and 
goodness of His creatures issues from Him. Therefore the Angel, seeing that 
the dignity of his own nature transcended that of the other creatures, 
wished and asked that the blessedness and goodness of all the inferior 
creatures should be derived from him. And he sought this in his own natural 
capacity, that just as he was the first to be endowed in nature with those 
qualities, so the other creatures should receive them from the nobility of 
his nature. And he sought this of God, in perfect willingness to remain 
subject to God so long as he had that power granted to him. Therefore he did 
not wish to be made equal with God absolutely, but only with a reservation.
        It is further to be noted that, wishing to bring his desire to the 
point of action, he suddenly made it known to others; and the understanding 
of the other Angels of his desire, and their perverse consenting to it, was 
also sudden. Therefore the sin of the First Angel exceeded and preceded the 
sins of the others in respect of the magnitude of his guilt and causality, 
but not in respect of duration. See Apocalypse xii. The dragon falling from 
heaven drew with him the third part of the stars. And he lives in the form 
of Leviathan, and is king over all the children or pride. And, according to 
Aristotle (Metaph., V), he is called king of princes, inasmuch as he moves 
those who are subject to him according to his will and command. Therefore 
his sin was the occasion of sin in others, since he first, not having been 
tempted from outside, was the external temptation of others.
        And that all these things happened instantaneously may be 
exemplified by physical things; for the ignition of a gas, the sight of the 
flame, and the impression formed by that sight all happen at one and the 
same time.
        I have put this matter at some length; for in the consideration of 
that stupendous Divine permission in the case of the most noble creatures 
with regard to the one sin of ambition, it will be easier to admit 
particular permissions in the case of the works of witches, which are in 
some certain circumstances even greater sins. For in certain circumstances 
the sins of witches are greater than that of the Angel or of our first 
parents, as will be shown in the Second Part.
        Now the fact that the providence of God permitted the first man to 
be tempted and to sin is sufficiently clear from what has been said 
concerning the transgression of the Angels. For both man and the Angel were 
created to the same end, and left with free-will, in order that they might 
receive the reward of blessedness not without merit. Therefore, just as the 
Angel was not preserved from his fall, in order that the power of sin on the 
one side and the power of the confirmation of grace on the other side might 
work together for the glory of the universe, so also ought it to be 
considered in the case of man.
        Wherefore S. Thomas (II, 23, art. 2) says: That by which God is 
glorified ought not to be hindered from within. But God is glorified in sin, 
when He pardons in mercy and when He punishes in justice; therefore it 
behoves Him not to hinder sin. Let us, then, return to a brief 
recapitulation of our proposition, namely, that by the just providence of 
God man is permitted to sin for many reasons. First, that the power of God 
may be shown, Who alone is unchanging while every creature is variable. 
Secondly, that the wisdom of God may be declared, Who can bring good out of 
evil, which could not be unless God had allowed the creature to sin. 
Thirdly, that the mercy of God may be made manifest, by which Christ through 
His death liberated man who was lost. Fourthly, that the justice of God may 
be shown, which not only rewards the good, but also punishes the wicked. 
Fifthly, that the condition of man may not be worse than that of other 
creatures, all of whom God so governs that He allows them to act after their 
own nature; wherefore it behoved Him to leave man to his own judgement. 
Sixthly, for the glory of men; that is, the glory of the just man who could 
transgress but has not. And seventhly, for the adorning of the universe; for 
as there is a threefold evil in sin, namely, guilty, pain, and loss, so is 
the universe adorned by the corresponding threefold good, namely, 
righteousness, pleasure, and usefulness. For righteousness is adorned by 
guilt, pleasure by pain, and all usefullness by loss. And by this the answer 
to the arguments is made plain. 

Solutions to the Arguments.

        According to the first argument it is heretical to maintain that the 
devil is allowed power to injure men. But the opposite appears rather to be 
true; for it is heretical to assert that God does not permit man, of his own 
free-will, to sin when he wishes. And God permits much sin, by reason of His 
power to hurt men in the punishment of the wicked for the adorning of the 
universe. For it is said by S. Augustine in his Book of Soliloques: Thou, 
Lord, hast commanded, and it is so, that the shame of guilt should never be 
without the glory of punishment.
        And that is not a valid proof of the argument which is taken from 
the wise ruler who keeps away all defect and evil as far as he can. For it 
is quite different with God, Who has an universal care, from one who has 
only a particular care. For God, Whose care is universal, can bring good out 
of evil, as is shown by what has been said.
        For the second argument, it is clear that God's power as well as His 
goodness and justice are manifest in His permission of sin. So when it is 
argued that God either can or cannot prevent evil, the answer is that He can 
prevent it, but that for the reasons already shown it does not behove Him to 
do so.
        Neither is it valid to object that He therefore wishes evil to be; 
since He can prevent it but will not; for, as has been shown in the 
arguments for the truth, God cannot wish evil to be. He neither wishes nor 
does not wish it, but He permits it for the perfecting of the universe.
        In the third argument S. Augustine and Aristotle are quoted on the 
subject of human knowledge, saying that it is better for a man not to have 
knowledge of that which is evil and vile for two reasons: first, that then 
he will have less opportunity to think of evil, since we cannot understand 
many things at the same time. And secondly, because knowledge of evil 
sometimes perverts the will towards evil. But these arguments do not concern 
God, Who without and detriment understands all the deeds of men and of 
witches.
        For the fourth argument: S. Paul excepts the care of God from oxen, 
to show that a rational creature has through free-will command over its 
actions, as has been said. Therefore God has a special providence over him, 
that either blame or merit may be imputed to him, and he may receive either 
punishment or reward; but that God does not in this way care for the 
irrational beasts.
        But to argue from that authority that the individuals of irrational 
creation have no part in Divine providence would be heretical; for it would 
be to maintain that all things are not subject to Divine providence, and 
would be contrary to the praise which is spoken in Holy Scripture concerning 
the Divine wisdom, which stretches mightily from end to end and disposes all 
things well; and it would be the error of the Rabbi Moses as was shown in 
the arguments for the truth.
        For the fifth argument, man did not institute nature, but puts the 
works of nature to the greatest use known to his skill and strength. 
Therefore human providence does not extend to the inevitable phenomena of 
nature, as that the sun will rise to-morrow. But God's providence does 
extend to these things, since He is Himself the author of nature. Wherefore 
also defects in nature, even if they arise out of the natural course of 
things, are subject to Divine providence. And therefore Democritus and the 
other natural philosophers were in error when they ascribed whatever 
happened to the inferior creation to the mere chance of matter.
        For the last argument: although every punishment is inflicted by God 
for sin, yet the greatest sinners are not always afflicted with witchcraft. 
And this may be because the devil does not wish to afflict and tempt those 
whom he sees to belong to him by just title, or because he does not wish 
them to be turned back to God. As it is said: Their plagues were multiplied, 
and they turned them to God, etc. And that all punishment is inflicted by 
God for sin is shown by what follows; for according to S. Jerome: Whatever 
we suffer, we deserve for our sins.
        Now it is declared that the sins of witches are more grievous than 
those of the bad angels and our first parents. Wherefore, just as the 
innocent are punished for the sins of their fathers, so are many blameless 
people damned and bewitched for the sins of witches. 




Question XIV  The Enormity of Witches is Considered, and it is shown that 
the Whole Matter should be rightly Set Forth and Declared.  

        Concerning the enormity of crimes, it is asked whether the crimes of 
witches exceed, both in guilt, in pain, and in loss, all the evils which God 
allows and has permitted from the beginning of the world up till now. And it 
seems that they do not, especially as regards guilt. For the sin which a man 
commits when he could easily avoid it is greater than the sin which another 
man commits when he could not so easily avoid it. This is shown by S. 
Augustine, de Ciuit. Dei: There is great wickedness in sinning when it is so 
easy not to sin. But Adam, and others who have sinned when in a state of 
perfection or even of grace, could more easily because of the help of grace 
have avoided their sins — especially Adam who was created in grace — than 
many witches, who have not shared in such gifts. Therefore the sins of such 
are greater than all the crimes of witches.
        And again in respect of punishment: the greatest punishment is due 
to the greater blame. But Adam's sin was the most heavily punished, as is 
plainly proved by the fact that both his guilt and his punishment are shown 
in all his posterity by the inheritance of original sin. Therefore his sin 
is greater than all other sins.
        And again, the same is argued in respect of loss. For according to 
S. Augustine: A thing is evil in that it takes away from the good; therefore 
where there is the more good lost, there the greater evil has gone before. 
But the sin of our first parent brought the greatest loss both to nature and 
to grace, since it deprived us of innocence and immortality; and no 
subsequent sin has brought such loss, therefore, etc.
        But the contrary side: that which includes the most causes of evil 
is the greater evil, and such are the sins of witches. For they can, with 
God's permission, bring every evil upon that which is good by nature and in 
form, as is declared in the Papal Bull. Besides, Adam sinned only in doing 
that which was wrong in one of two ways; for it was forbidden, but was not 
wrong in itself: but witches and other sinners sin in doing that which is 
wrong in both ways, wrong in itself, and forbidden, such as murders and many 
other forbidden things. Therefore their sins are heavier than other sins.
        Besides, sin which comes from definite malice is heavier than sin 
which comes from ignorance. But witches, out of great malice, despise the 
Faith and the sacraments of the Faith, as many of them have confessed.
        Answer. The evils which are perpetrated by modern witches exceed all 
other sin which God has ever permitted to be done, as was said in the title 
of this Question. And this can be shown in three ways, in so far as they are 
sins involving perversity of character, though it is different with the sins 
that contravene the other Theological virtues. First in general, by 
comparing their works indifferently with any other worldly crimes. Secondly 
in particular, by considering the species of the superstition and into what 
pact they have entered with the devil. And thirdly, by comparing their sins 
with the sins of the bad Angels and even with that of our first parents.
        And first, sin is threefold, involving guilt, punishment, and loss. 
Good also is correspondingly threefold, involving righteousness, felicity, 
and use. And righteousness corresponds with the guilt, felicity with 
punishment, and use with loss.
        That the guilt of witches exceeds all other sins is apparent in this 
way. For according to the teaching of S. Thomas (II, 22, art. 2), there is 
in the matter of sin much that may be considered whereby the gravity or 
lightness of the sin may be deduced; and the same sin may be found heavy in 
one and light in another. For example, we can say that in fornication a 
young man sins, but an old man is mad. Yet those sins are, simply speaking, 
the heavier which are not only attended by the more extensive and more 
powerful circumstances, but are in their nature and quantity of a more 
essentially serious sort.
        And so we can say that, though the sin of Adam was in some respects 
heavier than all other sins, inasmuch as he fell to the instigation of a 
smaller temptation, since it came only from within; and also because he 
could more easily have resisted on account of the original justice in which 
he was created: nevertheless in the form and quantity of sin, and in other 
respects which aggravate the sin the more in that it is the cause of many 
yet heavier sins, the sins of witches exceed all other sins. And this will 
be made still clearer in two ways.
        For one sin is said to be greater than another in one or other of 
the following respects: in causality, as was the sin of Lucifer; in 
generality, as Adam's sin; in hideousness, as was the sin of Judas; in the 
difficulty of forgiving it, as is the sin against the Holy Ghost; in danger, 
as in the sin of covetousness; in inclination, as is the sin of the flesh; 
in the offending of the Divine Majesty, as is the sin of idolatry and 
infidelity; in the difficulty of combating it, as the sin of pride; in 
blindness of mind, as the sin of anger. Accordingly, after the sin of 
Lucifer, the works of witches exceed all other sins, in hideousness since 
they deny Him crucified, in inclination since the commit nastiness of the 
flesh with devils, in blindness of mind since in a pure spirit of malignity 
the rage and bring every injury upon the souls and bodies of men and beasts, 
as has been shown from what has been said before.
        And this, indeed, is indicated, according to S. Isidore, by the 
word. For they are called witches (maleficae) on account of the enormity of 
their crimes, as has been said above.
        Our contention is also deduced from the following. There are two 
gradations in sin, a turning away, and a change of heart. See our quotation 
from S. Augustine: Sin is to reject the incommutable good, and to cleave to 
things that are variable. And the turning away from God is as it were 
formal, just as the change of heart is as it were material. Therefore the 
more a man is separated from God by it, the heavier is the sin. And since 
infidelity is the chief cause of man's separation from God, the infidelity 
of witches stands out as the greatest of sins. And this is given the name of 
Heresy, which is Apostasy from the Faith; and in this witches sin throughout 
their whole lives.
        For the sin of infidelity consists in opposing the Faith; and this 
may come about in two ways, by opposing a faith which has not yet been 
received, or by opposing it after it has been received. Of the first sort is 
the infidelity of the Pagans or Gentiles. In the second way, the Christian 
Faith may be denied in two ways: either by denying the prophecies concerning 
it, or by denying the actual manifestation of its truth. And the first of 
these is the infidelity of the Jews, and the second the infidelity of 
Heretics.
        It is clear from this that the heresy of witches is the most heinous 
of the three degrees of infidelity; and this fact is proved both by reason 
and authority. For it is said in II. S. Peter ii: It has been better for 
them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known 
it, to turn from it. And it is reasonable to suppose that, just as he who 
does not perform what he has promised commits a greater sin than he who does 
not perform what he never promised, so the infidelity of the heretics, who 
while professing the faith of the Gospel fight against it by corrupting it, 
is a greater sin than that of the Jews and Pagans.
        And again, the Jews sin more greatly than the Pagans; for they 
received the prophecy of the Christian Faith in the Old Law, which they 
corrupt through badly interpreting it, which is not the case with the 
Pagans. Therefore their infidelity is a greater sin than that of the 
Gentiles, who never received the Faith of the Gospel. But concerning 
Apostasy, S. Thomas says in the Second of the Second, question 12: Apostasy 
means a turning away from God and religion, and this may happen according to 
the different ways by which man is joined to God; that is, by faith, or by 
the subjection of the will to obedience, or by religion and Holy Orders. S. 
Raymund and Hostiensis say that Apostasy is a rash departure from the state 
of faith or obedience or Religion. Now if that which precedes is removed, 
that which follows from it is also removed; but the converse proposition is 
not true. Therefore Apostasy from the Faith is a greater sin than the other 
two forms of infidelity, since in its case a precedent Religion has been 
removed.
        But according to S. Raymund, a man is not to be judged an Apostate 
or deserter, however far and long he may have strayed, unless he shows by 
his subsequent life that he has not though of returning to the Faith. And 
this would be shown in the case of a cleric if he were to marry a wife, or 
commit some similar crime. In the same way it is an Apostasy of disobedience 
when a man wilfully spurns the teaching of the Church and the Bishops. And 
such a man must be convicted of his infamy, and be excommunicated.
        Now when we speak of the Apostasy of witches, we mean the Apostasy 
of perfidy; and this is so much the more heinous, in that it springs from a 
pact made with the enemy of the Faith and the way of salvation. For witches 
are bound to make this pact, which is exacted by that enemy either in part 
or wholly. For we Inquisitors have found some witches who have denied all 
the articles of Faith, and others who have denied only a certain number of 
them; but they are all bound to deny true and sacramental confession. And 
so, even the Apostasy of Julian does not seem to have been so great, 
although in other respects he did more harm against the Church; but we 
cannot speak of that here.
        But it may be incidentally objected that it is possible that they 
may keep the Faith in the thoughts of their hearts, which God alone, and not 
even any Angel, can see into; but do reverence and obedience to the devil 
only in outward form. The answer to this seems to be that there are two 
degrees of the Apostasy of perfidy. One consists in outward acts of 
infidelity, without the formation of any pact with the devil, as when one 
lives in the lands of the infidels and conforms his life to that of the 
Mohammedans. The other consists in a pact made with the devil by one who 
lives in Christian lands, In the first case, men who keep the Faith in their 
hearts but deny it in their outward acts, though they are not Apostates or 
Heretics, are guilty of deadly sin. For in this way Solomon showed reverence 
to the gods of his wives. And no one can be excused on the ground that he 
does this through fear; for S. Augustine says: It is better to die of hunger 
than to be fed by Idolaters. But however much witches may retain the Faith 
in their hearts while denying it with their lips, they are still to be 
judged Apostates, since they have made a treaty with death and a compact 
with hell. Wherefore S. Thomas (II, 4), speaking of such magic works, and of 
those who in any way seek help from devils, says: They are all Apostates 
from the Faith, by reason of a pact made with the Devil, either in word, 
when some invocation is used, or by some deed, even if there is no actual 
sacrifice. For no man can serve two masters.
        To the same effect writes Blessed Albertus Magnus, where he asks 
whether the sin of Magicians and Astrologers is an Apostasy from the Faith. 
And he answers: In such there is always Apostasy either of word or of deed. 
For if any invocations are made, then there is an open pact made with the 
devil, and it is plainly Apostasy in word. But if their magic is simply a 
matter of action, then it is Apostasy in deed. And since in all these there 
is abuse of the Faith, seeing that they look for from the devil what they 
ought to look for from God, therefore they are always to be judged 
Apostates. See how clearly they set forth two degrees of Apostasy, 
understanding a third, namely, that of thought. And even if this last is 
lacking, yet witches are judged to be Apostates in word and deed. Therefore, 
as will be shown, they must be subject to the punishment of Heretics and 
Apostates.
        And there is in them a third enormity of crime, exceeding all other 
heresies. For S. Augustine (XXVIII, 1 and 2) tells us that the whole life of 
infidels is a sin; and the gloss on Romans xiv says that everything which 
comes not of faith is sin. What then is to be thought of the whole life of 
witches, that is, of all their other actions which are not pleasing to the 
devil, such as fasting, attending church, communicating, and other things? 
For in all these things they commit deadly sin, as is shown as follows. So 
far have they fallen in sin that, although they have not lost all power of 
amendment (since sin does not corrupt the whole good of their nature, and a 
natural light yet remains in them); yet, because of their homage given to 
the devil, and unless they be absolved from it, all their works, even when 
they appear to be good, are rather of an evil nature. And this is not seen 
to be the case with other infidels.
        For according to S. Thomas in the Second of the Second, question 10, 
Whether every action of an infidel is a sin; he says that the deeds of the 
unfaithful which are, of themselves, good, such as fasting, almsgiving, and 
deeds of that sort, are no merit to them because of their infidelity, which 
is a most grievous sin. Yet sin does not corrupt the whole good of their 
nature, and there remains in them a natural light. Therefore not ever deed 
of theirs is mortal sin, but only those which proceed from their very 
infidelity, or are related to it. For example, a Saracen fasts, to observe 
the law of Mohammed as to fasting, and a Jew observes his Feast days; but in 
such things he is guilty of mortal sin. And in this way is to be understood 
the above dictum of S. Augustine, that the whole life of infidels is sin. 

That Witches Deserve the heaviest Punishment above All the Criminals of the 
World.

        The crimes of witches, then, exceed the sins of all others; and we 
now declare what punishment they deserve, whether as Heretics or as 
Apostates. Now Heretics, according to S. Raymund, are punished in various 
ways, as by excommunication, deposition, confiscation of their goods, and 
death. The reader can be fully informed concerning all these by consulting 
the law relating to the sentence of excommunication. Indeed even their 
followers, protectors, patrons and defenders incur the heaviest penalties. 
For, besides the punishment of excommunication inflicted upon them, 
Heretics, together with their patrons, protectors and defenders, and with 
their children to the second generation on the father's side, and to the 
first degree on the mother's side, are admitted to no benefit or office of 
the Church. And if a Heretic have Catholic children, for the heinousness of 
his crime they are deprived of their paternal inheritance. And if a man be 
convicted, and refuse to be converted and abjure his heresy, he must at once 
be burned, if he is a layman. For if they who counterfeit money are 
summarily put to death, how much more must they who counterfeit the Faith? 
But if he is a cleric, after solemn degradation he is handed over to the 
secular Court to be put to death. But if they return to the Faith, they are 
to be imprisoned for life. But in practice they are treated more leniently 
after recantation than they should be according to the judgement of the 
Bishops and Inquisition, as will be shown in the Third Part, where the 
various methods of sentencing such are treated of; that is to say, those who 
are arrested and convicted and have recanted their error.
        But to punish witches in these ways does not seem sufficient, since 
they are not simple Heretics, but Apostates. More than this, in their very 
apostasy they do not deny the Faith for any fear of men or for any delight 
of the flesh, as has been said before; but, apart from their abnegation, 
even give homage to the very devils by offering them their bodies and souls. 
Is is clear enough from this that, however much they are penitent and return 
to the Faith, they must not be punished like other Heretics with lifelong 
imprisonment, but must be made to suffer the extreme penalty. And because of 
the temporal injury which they do to men and beasts in various ways, the 
laws demand this. Is is even equally culpable to learn as it is to teach 
such iniquities, say the laws concerning Soothsayers. Then how much more 
emphatically do they speak concerning witches, where they say that the 
penalty for them is the confiscation of their goods and decapitation. The 
laws also say much concerning those who by witchcraft provoke a woman to 
lust, or, conversely, cohabit with beasts. But these matters were touched 
upon on the First Question. 




Question XV  It is Shown that, on Account of the Sins of Witches, the 
Innocent are often Bewitched, yea, Sometimes even for their Own Sins.  

        It is a fact that, by Divine permission, many innocent people suffer 
loss and are punished by the aforesaid plagues, not for their own sins, but 
for those of witches. And lest this should seem to any a paradox, S. Thomas 
shows in the Second of the Second, quest. 8, that this is just in God. For 
he divides the punishments of this life into three classes. First, one man 
belongs to another; therefore, if a man be punished in his possessions, it 
may be that another man suffers for this punishment. For, bodily speaking, 
sons are a property of the father, and slaves and animals are the property 
of their masters; and so the sons are sometimes punished for their parents. 
Thus the son born to David from adultery quickly died; and the animals of 
the Amalekites were bidden to be killed. Yet the reason for these things 
remains a mystery.
        Secondly, the sin of one may be passed on to another; and this in 
two ways. By imitation, as children imitate the sins of their parents, and 
slaves and dependents the sins of their masters, that they may sin more 
boldly. In this way the sons inherit ill-gotten gain, and slaves share in 
robberies and unjust feuds, in which they are often killed. And they who are 
subject to Governors sin the more boldly when they see them sin, even if 
they do not commit the same sins; wherefore they are justly punished.
        Also the sin of one is passed on to another in the way of desert, as 
when the sins of wicked subjects are passed on to a bad Governor, because 
the sins of the subjects deserve a bad Governor. See Job: He makes 
Hypocrites to reign on account of the sins of the people.
        Sin, and consequently punishment, can also be passed on through some 
consent or dissimulation. For when those in authority neglect to reprove 
sin, then very often the good are punished with the wicked, as S. Augustine 
says in the first book de Ciuitate Dei. An example was brought to our notice 
as Inquisitors. A town was once rendered almost destitute by the death of 
its citizens; and there was a rumour that a certain buried woman was 
gradually eating the shroud in which she had been buried, and that the 
plague could not cease until she had eaten the whole shroud and absorbed it 
into her stomach. A council was held, and the Podesta with the Governor of 
the city dug up the grave, and found half the shroud absorbed through the 
mouth and throat into the stomach, and consumed. In horror at this sight, 
the Podesta drew his sword and cut off her head and threw it out of the 
grave, and at once the plague ceased. Now the sins of that old woman were, 
by Divine permission, visited upon the innocent on account of the 
dissimulation of what had happened before. For when an Inquisition was held 
it was found that during a long time of her life she had been a Sorceress 
and Enchantress. Another example is the punishment of a pestilence because 
David numbered the people.
        Thirdly, sin is passed on by Divine permission in commendation of 
the unity of human society, that one man should take care for another by 
refraining from sin; and also to make sin appear the more detestable, in 
that the sin of one redounds upon all, as though all were one body. An 
example is the sin of Achan in Joshua vii.
        We can add to these two other methods: that the wicked are punished 
sometimes by the good, and sometimes by other wicked men. For as Gratianus 
says (XXIII, 5), sometimes God punishes the wicked through those who are 
exercising their legitimate power at His command; and this in two ways: 
sometimes with merit on the part of the punishers, as when He punished the 
sins of the Canaanites through His people; sometimes with no merit on the 
part of the punishers, but even to their own punishment, as when He punished 
the tribe of Benjamin and destroyed it except for a few men. And sometimes 
He punishes by His nations being aroused, either by command or permission, 
but with no intention of obeying God, but rather greedy for their own gain, 
and therefore to their own damnation; as He now punished His people by the 
Turks, and did so more often by strange nations in the Old Law.
        But it must be noted that for whatever cause a man be punished, if 
he does not bear his pains patiently, then it becomes a scourge, not a 
correction, but only of vengeance, that is, of punishment. See Deuteronomy 
xxxii: A fire is kindled in min anger (that is, my punishment; for there is 
no other anger in God), and shall burn unto the lowest hell (that is, 
vengeance shall begin here and burn unto the last damnation, as S. Augustine 
explains), And there is further authority concerning punishment in his 
Fourth Distinction. But if men patiently bear their scourges, and are 
patient in the state of grace, they take the place of a correction, as S. 
Thomas says in his Fourth Book. And this is true even of one punished for 
committing witchcraft, or of a witch, to a greater or less degree according 
to the devotion of the sufferer and the quality of his crime.
        But the natural death of the body, being the last terror, is not a 
correction, since of its nature it partakes in the punishment for original 
sin. Nevertheless, according to Scotus, when it is awaited with resignation 
and devotion, and offered in its bitterness to God, it can in some way 
become a correction. But violent death, whether a man deserves it or not, is 
always a correction, if it is borne patiently and in grace. So much for 
punishments inflicted on account of the sins of others.
        But God also punishes men in this life for their own sins, 
especially in the matter of bewitchment. For see Tobias vii: The devil has 
power over those who follow their lusts. And this is clear from what we have 
already said concerning the member and the genital powers, which God chiefly 
allows to be bewitched.
        However, for the purpose of preaching to the public it is to be 
noted that, notwithstanding the aforesaid punishments which God inflicts on 
men for their own and others' sins, the preacher should keep as his basic 
principle and to the people this ruling of the law; which says, No one must 
be punished without guilt, unless there is some cause for doing so. And this 
ruling holds good in the Court of Heaven, that is, of God, just as it does 
in the human Courts of Justice, whether secular or ecclesiastic.
        The preacher may predicate this of the Court of Heaven. For the 
punishment of God is of two kinds, spiritual and temporal. In the former, 
punishment is never found without guilt. In the latter it is sometimes found 
quite without guilt, but not without cause. The first, or spiritual 
punishment, is of three kinds; the first being forfeiture of grace and a 
consequent hardening in sin, which is never inflicted except for the 
sufferer's own guilt. The second is the punishment of loss, that is, 
deprivation of glory, which is never inflicted without personal guilt in 
adults, or contracted guilt in children born from their parents' sin. The 
third is the punishment of pain, that is, the torture of hell fire, and is 
plainly due to guilt. Wherefore when it is said in Exodus xx: I am a jealous 
God, visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and 
fourth generation: it is understood as speaking of the imitators of their 
fathers' crimes, as Gratian has explained, Book I, quest. 4; where he also 
gives other expositions.
        Now with regard to God's second, or temporal punishment: first, it 
may be, as has been said before, for the sin of another (but not without 
cause), or for personal guilt only, without any other's sin. But if you wish 
to know the causes for which God punishes, and even without any guilt of the 
sufferer or of another man, you may refer to the five methods which the 
Master expounds in Book IV, dist. 15, cap. 2. And you must take the three 
first causes, for the other two refer to personal guilt.
        For he says that for five causes God scourges man in this life, or 
inflicts punishment. First, that God may be glorified; and this is when some 
punishment or affliction is miraculously removed, as in the case of the man 
born blind (S. John ix), or of the raising of Lazarus (S. John xi).
        Secondly, if the first cause is absent, it is sent that merit may be 
acquired through the exercise of patience, and also that inner hidden virtue 
may be made manifest to others. Examples are Job i and Tobias ii.
        Thirdly that virtue may be preserved through the humiliation of 
castigation. S. Paul is an example, who says of himself in II. Corinthians 
xii: There was given unto me a thorn in my flesh, the messenger of Satan. 
And according to Remigius this thorn was the infirmity of carnal desire. 
These are the cause that are without guilt in the sufferer.
        Fourthly, that eternal damnation should begin in this life, that it 
might be in some way shown what will be suffered in hell. Examples are Herod 
(Acts xii) and Antiochus (II. Maccabees ix).
        Fifthly, that man may be purified, by the expulsion and obliteration 
of his guilt through scourges. Examples may be taken from Miriam, Aaron's 
sister, who was stricken with leprosy, and from the Israelites wandering in 
the wilderness, according to S. Jerome, XXIII, 4. Or it may be for the 
correction of sin, as is exemplified by the case of David, who, after being 
pardoned for his adultery, was driven from his kingdom, as is shown in II. 
Kings, and is commented on by S. Gregory in his discourse on sin. It may, in 
fact, be said that every punishment that we suffer proceeds from our own 
sin, or at least from the original sin in which we were born, which is 
itself the cause of all causes.
        But as to the punishment of loss, meaning by that eternal damnation 
which they will suffer in the future, no one doubts that all the damned will 
be tortured with grevious pains. For just as grace is followed by the 
blessed vision of the Kingdom of Heaven, so is mortal sin followed by 
punishment in hell. And just as the degrees of blessedness in Heaven are 
measured in accordance with the degrees of charity and grace in life, so the 
degrees of punishment in hell are measured according to the degree of crime 
in this life. See Deuteronomy xxv: The measure of punishment will be 
according to the measure of sin. And this is so with all other sins, but 
applies especially to witches. See Hebrews x: Of how much sorer punishment, 
suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden underfoot the Son 
of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was 
sanctified, an unholy thing?
        And such are the sins of witches, who deny the Faith, and work many 
evil bewitchments through the most Holy Sacrament, as will be shown in the 
Second Part. 




Question XVI  The Foregoing Truths are Set out in Particular, this by a 
Comparison of the Works of Witches with Other Baleful Superstitions.  

        Now the foregoing truth concerning the enormity of witches' crimes 
is proved by comparing them with the other practices of Magicians and 
Diviners. For there are fourteen species of magic, springing from the three 
kinds of Divination. The first of these three is open invocation of devils. 
The second is no more than a silent consideration of the disposition and 
movement of some thing, as of the stars, or the days, or the hours, and such 
things. The third is the consideration of some human act for the purpose of 
finding out something that is hidden, and is called by the name of 
Sortilege.
        And the species of the first form of Divination, that is, an open 
invocation of devils, are the following: Sorcery, Oneiromancy, Necromancy, 
Oracles, Geomancy, Hydromancy, Aeromancy, Pyromancy, and Soothsaying (see S. 
Thomas, Second of the Second, quest. 95, 26, and 5). The species of the 
second kind are Horoscopy, Haruspicy, Augury, Observation of Omens, 
Cheiromancy and Spatulamancy.
        The species of the third kind vary according to all those things 
which are classed as Sortilege for the finding out of something hidden, such 
as the consideration of pricks and straws, and figures in molten lead. And 
S. Thomas speaks also of these in the above-quoted reference.
        Now the sins of witches exceed all these crimes, as will be proved 
in respect of the foregoing species. There can then be no question 
concerning smaller crimes.
        For let us consider the first species, in which those who are 
skilled in sorcery and glamour deceive the human senses with certain 
apparitions, so that corporeal matter seems to become different to the sight 
and the touch, as was treated of above in the matter of the methods of 
creating illusions. Witches are not content with such practices in respect 
of the genital member, causing some prestidigitatory illusion of its 
disappearance (although this disappearance is not an actual fact); but they 
even frequently take away the generative power itself, so that a woman 
cannot conceive, and a man cannot perform the act even when he still retains 
his member. And without any illusion, they also cause abortion after 
conception, often accompanied with many other ills. And they even appear in 
various forms of beasts, as has been shown above.
        Necromancy is the summoning of and speech with the dead, as is shown 
by its etymology; for it is derived from the Greek word Nekros, meaning a 
corpse, and Manteia, meaning divination. And they accomplish this by working 
some spell over the blood of a man or some animal, knowing that the devil 
delights in such sin, and loves blood and the pouring out of blood. 
Wherefore, when they think that they call the dead from hell to answer their 
questions, it is the devils in the likeness of the dead who appear and give 
such answers. And of this sort was the art of that great Pythoness spoken of 
in I. Kings xxviii, who raised up Samuel at the instance of Saul.
        But let no one think that such practices are lawful because the 
Scripture records that the soul of the just Prophet, summoned from Hades to 
predict the event of Saul's coming war, appeared through the means of a 
woman who was a witch. For, as S. Augustine says to Simplicianus: It is not 
absurd to believe that it was permitted by some dispensation, not by the
(cut off)




Question XVII  A Comparison of their Crimes under Fourteen Heads, with the 
Sins of the Devils of all and every Kind.  

        So heinous are the crimes of witches that they even exceed the sins 
and the fall of the bad Angels; and if this is true as to their guilt, how 
should it not also be true of their punishments in hell? And it is not 
difficult to prove this by various arguments with regard to their guilt. And 
first, although the sin of Satan is unpardonable, this is not on account of 
the greatness of his crime, having regard to the nature of the Angels, with 
particular attention to the opinion of those who say that the Angels were 
created only in a state of nature, and never in a state of grace. And since 
the good of grace exceeds the good of nature, therefore the sins of those 
who fall from a state of grace, as do the witches by denying the faith which 
they received in baptism, exceed the sins of the Angels. And even if we say 
that the Angels were created, but not confirmed, in grace; so also witches, 
though they are not created in grace
(cut off)



Question XVIII  Here follows the Method of Preaching against and 
Controverting Five Arguments of Laymen and Lewd Folk, which seem to be 
Variously Approved, that God does not Allow so Great Power to the Devil and 
Witches as is involved in the Performance of such Mighty Works of 
Witchcraft.  

        Finally, let the preacher br armed against certain arguments of 
laymen, and even of some learned men, who deny, up to a certain point, that 
there are witches. For, although they conceded the malice and power of the 
devil to inflict such evils at his will, they deny that the Divine 
permission is granted to him, and will not admit that God allows such things 
to be done. And although they have no method in their argument, groping 
blindly now this way and now that, it is yet necessary to reduce their 
assertions to five arguments, from which all their cavillings proceed. And 
the first is, that God does not permit the devil to rage against men wish 
such great power.
        The question put is whether the Divine permission must always 
accompany an infliction caused by the devil through a witch. And give 
arguments are submitted to prove that God does not permit it, and that 
therefore there is no witchcraft in the world. And the first argument is 
taken from God; the second from the devil; the third from the witch; the 
fourth from the affliction ascribed to witchcraft; and the fifth from the 
preachers and judges, on the assumption that they have so preached against 
and punished witches that they would have no security in life.
        And first as follows: God can punish men for their sins, and He 
punishes with the sword, famine, and pestilence; as well as with various and 
countless other infirmities to which human nature is subject. Wherefore, 
there being no need for Him to add further punishments, He does not permit 
witchcraft.
        Secondly, if that which is said of the devil were true, namely, that 
he can obstruct the generative forces so that a woman cannot conceive, or 
that if she does conceive, he can cause an abortion; or, if there is no 
abortion, he can cause the children to be killed after birth; in that case 
he would be able to destroy the whole world; and it could also be said that 
the devil's works were stronger than God's, since the Sacrament of matrimony 
is a work of God.
        Thirdly, they argue from man himself, that if there were any 
witchcraft in the world, then some men would be more bewitched than others; 
and that it is a false argument to say that men are bewitched for a 
punishment of their sins, and therefore false to maintain that there is 
witchcraft in the world. And they prove that it is false by arguing that, if 
it were true, then the greater sinners would receive the greater punishment, 
and that this is not the case; for sinners are less punished sometimes than 
the just, as is seen in the case of innocent children who are alleged to be 
bewitched.
        Their fourth argument can be added to that which they adduce 
concerning God; namely, that a thing which a man can prevent and does not 
prevent, but allows it to be done, may be judged to proceed from his will. 
But since God is All-Good, He cannot wish evil, and therefore cannot permit 
evil to be done which He is able to prevent.
        Again, taking their argument from the infliction itself, which is 
alleged to be due to witchcraft; they submit that they are similar to 
natural infirmities and defects, and may therefore by cause by a natural 
defect. For it may happen through some natural defect that a man becomes 
lame, or blind, or loses his reason, or even dies; wherefore such things 
cannot confidently be ascribed to witches.
        Lastly, they argue that preachers and judges have preached and 
practised against witches in such a way that, if there were witches, their 
lives would never be safe from them on account of the great hatred that 
witches would have for them.
        But the contrary arguments may be taken from the First Question, 
where it treats of the third postulate of the First Part; and those points 
may be propounded to the people which are most fitting. How God permits evil 
to be, even though He does not wish it; but He permits it for the wonderful 
perfecting of the universe, which may be considered in the fact that good 
things are more highly commendable, are more pleasing and laudable, when 
they are compared with bad things; and authority can be quoted in support of 
this. Also that the depth of God's Divine wisdom, justice, and goodness 
should be shown forth, whereas it would otherwise remain hidden.
        For a brief settlement of this question there are various treatises 
available on this subject for the information of the people, to the effect, 
namely, that God justly permitted two Falls, that of the Angels and that of 
our first parents; and since these were the greatest of all falls, it is no 
matter for wonder if other smaller ones are permitted. But it is in their 
consequences that those two Falls were the greatest, not in their 
circumstances, in which last respect, as was shown in the last Question, the 
sins of witches exceed those of the bad angels and our first parents. In the 
same place it is shown how God justly permitted those first Falls, and 
anyone is at liberty to collect and enlarge upon what is there said as much 
as he wishes.
        But we must answer their arguments. As to the first, that God 
punishes quite enough by means of natural diseases, and by sword and famine, 
we make a threefold answer. First, that God did not limit His power to the 
processes of nature, or even to the influences of the stars, in such a way 
that He cannot go beyond those limits; for He has often exceeded them in the 
punishment of sins, by sending plagues and other afflictions beyond all the 
influence of that stars; as when He punished the sin of pride in David, when 
he numbered the people, by sending a pestilence upon the people.
        Secondly, it agrees with the Divine wisdom that He should so govern 
all things that He allows them to act at their own instigation. 
Consequently, it is not His purpose to prevent altogether the malice of the 
devil, but rather to permit it as far as He sees it to be for the ultimate 
good of the universe; although it is true that the devil is continually held 
in check by the good Angels, so that he may not do all the harm that he 
wishes. Similarly He does not propose to restrain the human sins which are 
possible to man through his free-will, such as the abnegation of the Faith, 
and the devotion of himself to the devil, which things are in the power of 
the human will. From these two premisses it follows that, when God is most 
offended, He justly permits those evils which are chiefly sought for by 
witches, and for which they deny the Faith, up to the extent of the devil's 
power; and such is the ability to injure men, animals, and the fruits of the 
earth.
        Thirdly, God justly permits those evils which indirectly cause the 
greatest uneasiness and torment to the devil; and of such a sort are those 
evils which are done by witches through the power of devils. For the devil 
is indirectly tormented very greatly when he sees that, against his will, 
God uses all evil for the glory of His name, for the commendation of the 
Faith, for the purgation of the elect, and for the acquisition of merit. For 
it is certain that nothing can be more galling to the pride of the devil, 
which he always rears up against God (as it is said: The pride of them that 
hate Thee increases ever), than that God should convert his evil 
machinations to His own glory. Therefore God justly permits all these 
things.
        Their second argument has been answered before; but there are two 
points in it which must be answered in detail. In the first place, far from 
its being true that the devil, or his works, as stronger than God, it is 
apparent that his power is small, since he can do nothing without the Divine 
permission. Therefore it may be said that the devil's power is small in 
comparison with the Divine permission, although it is very great in 
comparison with earthly powers, which it naturally excels, as is shown in 
the often quoted text in Job xi: There is no power on earth to be compared 
with him.
        In the second place, we must answer the question with God permits 
witchcraft to affect the generative powers more than any other human 
function. This has been dealt with above, under the title, How witches can 
obstruct the generative powers and the venereal act. For it is on account of 
the shamefulness of that act, and because the original sin due to the guilt 
of our first parents is inherited by means of that act. It is symbolized 
also by the serpent, who was the first instrument of the devil.
        To their third we answer that the devil has more intention and 
desire to tempt the good than the wicked; although he does in fact tempt the 
wicked more than the good, for the reason that the wicked have more aptitude 
than the good to respond to his temptation. In the same way, he is more 
eager to injure the good than the bad, but he finds it easier to injure the 
wicked. And the reason for this is, according to S. Gregory, that the more 
often a man gives way to the devil, the harder he makes it for himself to 
struggle against him. But since it is the wicked who most often give way to 
the devil, their temptations are the hardest and most frequent, as they have 
not the shield of Faith with which to protect themselves. Concerning this 
shield S. Paul speaks in Ephesians vi. Above all, taking the shield of 
faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the 
wicked. But on the other hand, he assails the good more bitterly than the 
wicked. And the reason for this is that he already possesses the wicked, but 
not the good; and therefore he tried the harder to draw into his power 
through tribulation the just, who are not his, than the wicked, who are 
already his. In the same way, an earthly prince more severely chastises 
those who disobey his laws, or injure his kingdom, that those who do not set 
themselves against him.
        In answer to their fourth argument, in addition to what has already 
been written on this subject, the preacher can expound the truth that God 
permits evil to be done, but does not wish it to be done, by the five signs 
of the Divine will, which are Precept, Prohibition, Advice, Operation, and 
Permission. See S. Thomas, especially in his First Part, quest. 19, art. 12, 
where this is very plainly set forth. For although there is only one will in 
God, which is God Himself, just as His Essence is One; yet in respect of its 
fulfilment, His will is shown and signified to us in many ways, as the Psalm 
says: The mighty works of the Lord are fulfilled in all His wishes. 
Wherefore there is a distinction between the actual essential Will of God 
and its visible effects; even as the will, properly so called, is the will 
of a man's good pleasure, but in a metaphorical sense it is the will 
expressed by outward signs. For it is by signs and metaphors that we are 
shown that God wishes this to be.
        We may take an example from a human father who, while he has only 
one will in himself, expresses that will in five ways, either by his own 
agency, or through that of someone else. Through his own agency he expresses 
it in two ways, either directly or indirectly. Directly, when he himself 
does a thing; and then it is Operation. Indirectly, when he does not hinder 
someone else from acting (see Aritotle's Physics, IV: Prohibition is 
indirect causation), and this is called the sign of Permission. And the 
human father signifies his will through the agency of someone else in three 
ways. Either he orders someone to do something, or conversely forbids 
something; and these are the signs of Precept and Prohibition. Or he 
persuades and advises someone to do something; and this is the sign of 
Advice. And just as the human will is manifested in these five ways, so is 
God's will. For that God's will is shown by Precept, Prohibition, and Advice 
is seen in S. Matthew vi: Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven: that 
is to say, may we on earth fulfil His Precepts, avoid His Prohibitions, and 
follow His Advice. And in the same way, S. Augustine shows that Permission 
and Operation are signs of God's will, where he says in the Enchiridion: 
Nothing is done unless Almighty God wishes it to be done, either by 
permitting it or by Himself doing it.
        To return to the argument; it is perfectly true that when a man can 
prevent a thing, and does not, that thing may be said to proceed from his 
will. And the inference that God, being All-Good, cannot wish evil to be 
done, is also true in respect of the actual Good Pleasure of God's Will, and 
also in respect of four of the signs of His Will; for it is needless to say 
that He cannot operate evil, or command evil to be done, or fail to be 
opposed to evil, or advise evil; but He can, however, permit evil to be 
done.
        And if it is asked how it is possible to distinguish whether an 
illness is caused by witchcraft or by some natural physical defect, we 
answer that there are various methods. And the first is by means of the 
judgement of doctors. See the words of S. Augustine On the Christian 
Doctrine: To this class of superstition belong all charms and amulets 
suspended or bound about the person, which the School of Medicine despises. 
For example, doctors may perceive from the circumstances, such as the 
patient's age, healthy complexion, and the reaction of his eyes, that his 
disease does not result from any defect of the blood or the stomach, or any 
other infirmity; and they therefore judge that it is not due to any natural 
defect, but to some extrinsic cause. And since that extrinsic cause cannot 
be any poisonous infection, which would be accompanied by ill humours in the 
blood and stomach, they have sufficient reason to judge that it is due to 
witchcraft.
        And secondly, when the disease is incurable, so that the patient can 
be relieved by no drugs, but rather seems to be aggravated by them.
        Thirdly, the evil may come so suddenly upon a man that it can only 
be ascribed to witchcraft. An example of how this happened to one man has 
been made known to us. A certain well-born citizen of Spires had a wife who 
was of such an obstinate disposition that, though he tried to please her in 
every way, yet she refused in nearly every way to comply with his wishes, 
and was always plaguing him with abusive taunts. It happened that, on going 
into his house one day, and his wife railing against him as usual with 
opprobrious words, he wished to go out of the house to escape from 
quarrelling. But she quickly ran before him and locked the door by which he 
wished to go out; and loudly swore that, unless he beat her, there was no 
honesty or faithfulness in him. At these heavy words he stretched out his 
hand, not intending to hurt her, and struck her lightly with his open palm 
on the buttock; whereupon he suddenly fell to the ground and lost all his 
senses, and lay in bed for many weeks afflicted with a most grievous 
illness. Now it is obvious that this was not a natural illness, but was 
caused by some witchcraft of the woman. And very many similar cases have 
happened, and been made known to many.
        There are some who can distinguish such illnesses by means of a 
certain practice, which is as follows. They hold molten lead over the sick 
man, and pour it into a bowl of water. And if the lead condenses into some 
image, they judge that the sickness is due to witchcraft. And when such men 
are asked whether the image so formed is caused by the work of devils, or is 
due to some natural cause, they answer that it is due to the power of Saturn 
over lead, the influence of that planet being in other respects evil, and 
that the sun has a similar power over gold. But what should be thought of 
this practice, and whether it is lawful or not, will be discussed in the 
Second Part of this treatise. For the Canonists say that it is lawful that 
vanity may be confounded by vanity; but the Theologians hold a directly 
opposite view, saying that it is not right to do evil that good may come.
        In their last argument they advance several objections. First, why 
do not witches become rich? Secondly, why, having the favour of princes, do 
they not co-operate for the destruction of all their enemies? Thirdly, why 
are they unable to injure Preachers and others who persecute them?
        For the first, it is to be said that witches are not generally rich 
for this reason: that the devils like to show their contempt for the Creator 
by buying witches for the lowest possible price. And also, lest they should 
be conspicuous by their riches.
        Secondly, they do not injure princes because they wish to retain, as 
far as possible, their friendship. And if it is asked why they do not hurt 
their enemies, it is answered that a good Angel, working on the other side, 
prevents such witchcraft. Compare the passage in Daniel: The Prince of the 
Persians withstood me for twenty-one days. See S. Thomas in the Second Book 
of Sentences, where he debates whether there is any contest among the good 
Angels, and of what sort.
        Thirdly, it is said that they cannot injure Inquisitors and other 
officials, because they dispense public justice. Many examples could be 
adduced to prove this, but time does not permit it.

Question I  Of those against whom the Power of Witches availeth not at all.  

        The second main part of this work deals with the method of procedure 
adopted by witches for the performance of their witchcraft; and these are 
distinguished under eighteen heads, proceeding from two chief difficulties. 
The first of these two, dealt with in the beginning, concerns protective 
remedies, by which a man is rendered immune from witchcraft: the second, 
dealt with at the end, concerns curative remedies, by which those who are 
bewitched can be cured. For, as Aristotle says (Physics, IV), prevention and 
cure are related to one another, and are, accidentally, matters of 
causation. In this way the whole foundation of this horrible heresy may be 
made clear.
        In the above two divisions, the following points will be principally 
emphasized. First, the initiation of witches, and their profession of 
sacrilege. Second, the progress of their method of working, and of their 
horrible observances. Third, the preventive protections against their 
witchcrafts. And because we are now dealing with matters relating to morals 
and behaviour, and there is no need for a variety of arguments and 
disquisitions, since those matters which now follow under their headings are 
sufficiently discussed in the foregoing Questions; therefore we pray God 
that the reader will not look for proofs in every case, since it is enough 
to adduce examples that have been personally seen or heard, or are accepted 
at the word of credible witnesses.
        In the first of the points mentioned, two matters will be chiefly 
examined: first, the various methods of enticement adopted by the devil 
himself; second, the various ways in which witches profess their heresy. And 
in the second of the main points, six matters will be examined in order, 
relating to the procedure of witchcraft, and its cure. First, the practices 
of witches with regard to themselves and their own bodies. Second, their 
practices with regard to other men. Third, those relating to beasts. Fourth, 
the mischief they do to the fruits of the earth. Fifth, those kinds of 
witchcraft which are practised by men only and not by women. Sixth, the 
question of removing witchcraft, and how those who are bewitched may be 
cured. The First Question, therefore, is divided into eighteen heads, since 
in so many ways are their observances varied and multiplied.
        It is asked whether a man can be so blessed by the good Angels that 
he cannot be bewitched by witches in any of the ways that follow. And it 
seems that he cannot, for it has already been proved that even the blameless 
and innocent and the just are often afflicted by devils, as was Job; and 
many innocent children, as well as countless other just men, are seen to be 
bewitched, although not to the same extent as sinners; for they are not 
afflicted in the perdition of their souls, but only in their worldly goods 
and their bodies. But the contrary is indicated by the confessions of 
witches, namely, that they cannot injure everybody, but only those whom they 
learn, through the information of devils, to be destitute of Divine help.
        Answer. There are three classes of men blessed by God, whom that 
detestable race cannot injure with their witchcraft. And the first are those 
who administer public justice against them, or prosecute them in any public 
official capacity. The second are those who, according to the traditional 
and holy rites of the Church, make lawful use of the power and virtue which 
the Church by her exorcisms furnishes in the aspersion of Holy Water, the 
taking of consecrated salt, the carrying of blessed candles on the Day of 
the Purification of Our Lady, of palm leaves upon Palm Sunday, and men who 
thus fortify themselves are acting so that the powers of devils are 
diminished; and of these we shall speak later. The third class are those 
who, in various and infinite ways, are blessed by the Holy Angels.
        The reason for this in the first class will be given and proved by 
various examples. For since, as S. Paul says, all power if from God, and a 
sword for the avenging of the wicked and the retribution of the good, it is 
no wonder that devils are kept at bay when justice is being done to avenge 
that horrible crime.
        To the same effect the Doctors note that there are five ways in 
which the devil's power is hindered, either wholly or in part. First, by a 
limit fixed by God to his power, as is seen in Job i and ii. Another example 
is the case of the man we read of in the Formicarius of Nider, who had 
confessed to a judge that he had invoked the devil in order that he might 
kill an enemy of his, or do him bodily harm, or strike him dead with 
lightning. And he said: “When I had invoked the devil that I might commit 
such a deed with his help, he answered me that he was unable to do any of 
those things, because the man had good faith and diligently defended himself 
with the sign of the cross; and that therefore he could not harm him in his 
body, but the most he could do was to destroy an eleventh part of the fruit 
of his lands.”
        Secondly, it is hindered by the application of some exterior force, 
as in the case of Balaam's ass, Numbers xxii. Thirdly, by some externally 
performed miracle of power. And there are some who are blessed with an 
unique privilege, as will be shown later in the case of the third class of 
men who cannot be bewitched. Fourthly, by the good providence of God, Who 
disposes each thing severally, and causes a good Angel to stand in the 
devil's way, as when Asmodeus killed the seven husbands of the virgin Sara, 
but did not kill Tobias.
        Fifthly, it is sometimes due to the caution of the devil himself, 
for at times he does not wish to do hurt, in order that worse may follow 
from it. As, for example, when he could molest the excommunicated but does 
not do so, as in the case of the excommunicated Corinthian (I. Corinthians 
v), in order that he may weaken the faith of the Church in the power of such 
banishment. Therefore we may similarly say that, even if the administrators 
of public justice were not protected by Divine power, yet the devils often 
of their own accord withdraw their support and guardianship from witches, 
either because they fear their conversion, or because they desire and hasten 
their damnation.
        This fact is proved also by actual experience. For the aforesaid 
Doctor affirms that witches have borne witness that it is a fact of their 
own experience that, merely because they have been taken by officials of 
public justice, they have immediately lost all their power of witchcraft. 
For example, a judge named Peter, whom we have mentioned before, wished his 
officials to arrest a certain witch called Stadlin; but their hands were 
seized with so great a trembling, and such a nauseous stench came into their 
nostrils, that they gave up hope of daring to touch the witch. And the judge 
commanded them, saying: “You may safely arrest the wretch, for when he is 
touched by the hand of public justice, he will lose all the power of his 
iniquity.” And so the event proved; for he was taken and burned for many 
witchcrafts perpetrated by him, which are mentioned here and there in this 
work in their appropriate places.
        And many more such experiences have happened to us Inquisitors in 
the exercise of our inquisitorial office, which would turn the mind of the 
reader to wonder if it were expedient to relate them. But since self-praise 
is sordid and mean, it is better to pass them over in silence than to incur 
the stigma of boastfulness and conceit. But we must except those which have 
become so well known that they cannot be concealed.
        Not long ago in the town of Ratisbon the magistrates had condemned a 
witch to be burned, and were asked why it was that we Inquisitors were not 
afflicted like other men with witchcraft. They answered that witches had 
often tried to injure them, but could not. And, being asked the reason for 
this, they answered that they did not know, unless it was because the devils 
had warned them against doing so. For, they said, it would be impossible to 
tell how many times they have pestered us by day and by night, now in the 
form of apes, not of dogs or goats, disturbing us with their cries and 
insults; fetching us from our beds at their blasphemous prayers, so that we 
have stood outside the window of their prison, which was so high that no one 
could reach it without the longest of ladders; and then they have seemed to 
stick the pins with which their head-cloth was fastened violently into their 
heads. But praise be to Almighty God, Who in His pity, and for no merit of 
our own, has preserved us as unworthy public servants of the justice of the 
Faith.
        The reason in the case of the second class of men is self-evident. 
For the exorcisms of the Church are for this very purpose, and are entirely 
efficacious remedies for preserving oneself from the injuries of witches.
        But if it is asked in what manner a man ought to use such 
protections, we must speak first of those that are used without the uttering 
of sacred words, and then of the actual sacred invocations. For in the first 
place it is lawful in any decent habitation of men or beasts to sprinkle 
Holy Water for the safety and securing of men and beasts, with the 
invocation of the Most Holy Trinity and a Paternoster. For it is said in the 
Office of Exorcism, that wherever it is sprinkled, all uncleanness is 
purified, all harm is repelled, and no pestilent spirit can abide there, 
etc. For the Lord saves both man and beast, according to the Prophet, each 
in his degree.
        Secondly, just as the first must necessarily be sprinkled, so in the 
case of a Blessed Candle, although it is more appropriate to light it, the 
wax of it may with advantage be sprinkled about dwelling-houses. And 
thirdly, it is expedient to place or to burn consecrated herbs in those 
rooms where they can best be consumed in some convenient place.
        Now it happened in the city of Spires, in the same year that this 
book was begun, that a certain devout woman held conversation with a 
suspected witch, and, after the manner of women, they used abusive words to 
each other. But in the night she wished to put her little suckling child in 
its cradle, and remembered her encounter that day with the suspected witch. 
So, fearing some danger to the child, she placed consecrated herbs under it, 
sprinkled it with Holy Water, put a little Blessed Salt to its lips, signed 
it with the Sign of the Cross, and diligently secured the cradle. About the 
middle of the night she heard the child crying, and, as women do, wished to 
embrace the child, and life the cradle on to her bed. She lifted the candle, 
indeed, but could not embrace the child, because he was not there. The poor 
woman, in terror, and bitterly weeping for the loss of her child, lit a 
light, and found the child in a corner under a chair, crying but unhurt.
        In this it may be seen what virtue there is in the exorcisms of the 
Church against the snares of the devil. It is manifest that Almighty God, in 
His mercy and wisdom which extend from end to end, watches over the deeds of 
those wicked men; and that he gently directs the witchcraft of devils, so 
that when they try to diminish and weaken the Faith, they on the contrary 
strengthen it and make it more firmly rooted in the hearts of many. For the 
faithful may derive much profit from these evils; when, by reason of devils' 
works, the faith is made strong, God's mercy is seen, and His power 
manifested, and men are led into His keeping and to the reverence of 
Christ's Passion, and are enlightened by the ceremonies of the Church.
        There lived in a town of Wiesenthal a certain Mayor who was 
bewitched with the most terrible pains and bodily contortions; and he 
discovered, not by means of other witches, but from his own experience, how 
that witchcraft had been practised on him. For he said he was in the habit 
of fortifying himself every Sunday with Blessed Salt and Holy Water, but 
that he had neglected to do so on one occasion owing to the celebration of 
somebody's marriage; and on that same day he was bewitched.
        In Ratisbon a man was being tempted by the devil in the form of a 
woman to copulate, and became greatly disturbed when the devil would not 
desist. But it came into the poor man's mind that he ought to defend himself 
by taking Blessed Salt, as he had heard in a sermon. So, he took some 
Blessed Salt on entering the bath-room; and the woman looked fiercely at 
him, and, cursing whatever devil had taught him to do this, suddenly 
disappeared. For the devil can, with God's permission, present himself 
either in the form of a witch, or by possessing the body of an actual witch.
        There were also three companions walking along a road, and two of 
them were struck by lightning. The third was terrified, when he heard voices 
speaking in the air, “Let us strike him too.” But another voice answered, 
“We cannot, for to-day he has heard the words ‘The Word was made Flesh.’” 
And he understood that he had been saved because he had that day heard Mass, 
and, at the end of the Mass, the Gospel of S. John: In the beginning was the 
Word, etc.
        Also sacred words bound to the body are marvellously protective, if 
seven conditions for their use are observed. But these will be mentioned in 
the last Question of this Second Part, where we speak of curative, as here 
we speak of preventive measures. And those sacred words help not only to 
protect, but also to cure those who are bewitched.
        But the surest protection for places, men, or animals are the words 
of the triumphal title of our Saviour, if they be written in four places in 
the form of a cross: IESUS † NAZARENUS † REX † IUDAEORUM †. There may also 
be added the name of MARY and of the Evangelists, or the words of S. John: 
The Word was made Flesh.
        But the third class of men which cannot be hurt by witches is the 
most remarkable; for they are protected by a special Angelic guardianship, 
both within and without. Within, by the inpouring of grace; without, by the 
virtue of the stars, that is, by the protection of the Powers which move the 
stars. And this class is divided into two sections of the Elect: for some 
are protected against all sorts of witchcrafts, so that they can be hurt in 
no way; and others are particularly rendered chaste by the good Angels with 
regard to the generative functions, just as evil spirits by their 
witchcrafts inflame the lusts of certain wicked men towards one woman, while 
they make them cold towards another.
        And their interior and exterior protection, by grace and by the 
influence of the stars, is explained as follows. For though it is God 
Himself Who pours grace into our souls, and no other creature has so great 
power as to do this (as it is said: The Lord will give grace and glory); 
yet, when God wished to bestow some especial grace, He does so in a 
dispositive way through the agency of a good Angel, as S. Thomas teaches us 
in a certain place in the Third Book of Sentences. 

        And this is the doctrine put forward by Dionysius in the fourth 
chapter de Diuinus Nominibus: This is the fixed and unalterable law of 
Divinity, that the High proceeds to the Low through a Medium; so that 
whenever of good emanates to us from the fountain of all goodness, comes 
through the ministry of the good Angels. And this is proved both by examples 
and by argument. For although only the Divine power was the cause of the 
Conception of the Word of God in the Most Blessed Virgin, through whom God 
was made man; yet the mind of the Virgin was by the ministry of an Angel 
much stimulated by the Salutation, and by the strengthening and information 
of her understanding, and was thus predisposed to goodness. This truth can 
also be reasoned as follows: It is the opinion of the above-mentioned Doctor 
that there are three properties of man, the will, the understanding, and the 
inner and outer powers belonging to the bodily members and organs. The first 
God alone can influence: For the heart of the king is in the hand of the 
Lord. A good Angel can influence the understanding towards a clearer 
knowledge of the true and the good, so that in the second of his properties 
both God and a good Angel can enlighten a man. Similarly in the third, a 
good Angel can endow a man with good qualities, and a bad Angel can, with 
God's permission, afflict him with evil temptations. However, it is in the 
power of the human will either to accept such evil influences or to reject 
them; and this a man can always do by invoking the grace of God.
        As to the exterior protection which comes from God through the 
Movers of the stars, the tradition is widespread, and conforms equally with 
the Sacred Writings and with natural philosophy. For all the heavenly bodies 
are moved by angelic powers which are called by Christ the Movers of the 
stars, and by the Church the Powers of the heavens; and consequently all the 
corporeal substances of this world are governed by the celestial influences, 
as witness Aristotle, Metaphysics I. Therefore we can say that the 
providence of God overlooks each on of His elect, but He subjects some of 
them to the ills of this life for their correction, while He so protects 
others that they can in no way be injured. And this gift they receive either 
from the good Angels deputed by God for their protection, or from the 
influence of the heavenly bodies or the Powers which move them.
        It is further to be noted that some are protected against all 
witchcrafts, and some against only a part of them. For some are particularly 
purified by the good Angels in their genital functions, so that witches can 
in no way bewitch them in respect of those functions. But it is in one sense 
superfluous to write of these, although in another sense it is needful for 
this reason: for those who are bewitched in their generative functions are 
so deprived of the guardianship of Angels that they are either in mortal sin 
always, or practise those impurities with too lustful a zest. In this 
connexion it has been shown in the First Part of this work that God permits 
greater powers of witchcraft against that function, not so much because of 
its nastiness, as because it was this act that caused the corruption of our 
first parents and, by its contagion, brought the inheritance of original sin 
upon the whole human race.
        But let us give a few examples of how a good Angel sometimes blesses 
just and holy men, especially in the matter of the genital instincts. For 
the following was the experience of the Abbot S. Serenus, as it is told by 
Cassian in his Collations of the Fathers, in the first conference of the 
Abbot Serenus. This man, he says, laboured to achieve an inward chastity of 
heart and soul, by prayers both by night and day, by fasting and by vigils, 
till he at last perceived that, by Divine grace, he had extinguished all the 
surgings of carnal concupiscence. Finally, stirred by an even greater zeal 
for chastity, he used all the above holy practices to pray the Almighty and 
All-Good God to grant him that, by God's gift, the chastity which he felt in 
his heart should be visibly conferred upon his body. Then an Angel of the 
Lord came to him in a vision in the night, and seemed to open his belly and 
take from his entrails a burning tumour of flesh, and then to replace all 
his intestines as they had been; and said: Lo! the provocation of your flesh 
is cut out, and know that this day you have obtained perpetual purity of 
your body, according to the prayer which you prayed, so that you will never 
again be pricked with that natural desire which is aroused even in babes and 
sucklings.
        Similarly S. Gregory, in the first book of his Dialogues, tells of 
the Blessed Abbot Equitius. This man, he says, was in his youth greatly 
troubled by the provocation of the flesh; but the very distress of his 
temptation made him all the more zealous in his application to prayer. And 
when he continuously prayed Almighty God for a remedy against this 
affliction, an Angel appeared to him one night and seemed to make him an 
eunuch, and it seemed to him in his vision that all feeling was taken away 
from his genital organs; and from that time he was such a stranger to 
temptation as if he had no sex in his body. Behold what benefit there was in 
that purification; for he was so filled with virtue that, with the help of 
Almighty God, just as he was before pre-eminent among, so he afterwards 
became pre-eminent over women.
        Again, in the Lives of the Fathers collected by that very holy man 
S. Heraclides, in the book which he calls Paradise, he tells of a certain 
holy Father, a monk named Helias. This man was moved by pity to collect 
thirty women in a monastery, and began to rule over them. But after two 
years, when he was thirty years old, he fled from the temptation of the 
flesh into a hermitage, and fasting there for two days, prayed to God, 
saying: “O Lord God, either slay me, or deliver me from this temptation.” 
And in the evening a dream came to him, and he saw three Angels approach 
him; and they asked him why he had fled from that monastery of virgins. But 
when he did not dare to answer, for shame, the Angels said: If you are set 
free from temptation, will you return to your cure of those women? And he 
answered that he would willingly. They then extracted an oath to that effect 
from him, and made him an eunuch. For one seemed to hold his hands, another 
his feet, and the third to cut out his testicles with a knife; though this 
was not really so, but only seemed to be. And when they asked if he felt 
himself remedied, he answered that he was entirely delivered. So, on the 
fifth day, he returned to the sorrowing women, and ruled over them for the 
forty years that he continued to live, and never again felt a spark of that 
first temptation.
        No less a benefit do we read to have been conferred upon the Blessed 
Thomas, a Doctor of our Order, whom his brothers imprisoned for entering 
that Order; and, wishing to tempt him, they sent in to him a seductive and 
sumptuously adorned harlot. But when the Doctor had looked at her, he ran to 
the material fire, and snatching up a lighted torch, drove the engine of the 
fire of lust out of his person; and, prostrating himself in a prayer for the 
gift of chastity, went to sleep. Two Angels then appeared to him, saying: 
Behold, at the bidding of God we gird you with a girdle of chastity, which 
cannot be loosed by any other such temptation; neither can it be acquired by 
the merits of human virtue, but is given as a gift by God alone. And he felt 
himself girded, and was aware of the touch of the girdle, and cried out and 
awaked. And thereafter he felt himself endowed with so great a gift of 
chastity, that from that time he abhorred all the delights of the flesh, so 
that he could not even speak to a woman except under compulsion, but was 
strong in his perfect chastity. This we take from the Formicarius of Nider.
        With the exception, therefore, of these three classes of men, no one 
is secure from witches. For all others are liable to be bewitched, or to be 
tempted and incited by some witchery, in the eighteen ways that are now to 
be considered. For we must first describe these methods in their order, that 
we may afterwards discuss more clearly the remedies by which those who are 
bewitched can be relieved. And that the eighteen methods may be more clearly 
shown, they are set forth under as many chapters as follows. First, we show 
the various methods of initiation of witches, and how they entice innocent 
girls to swell the numbers of their perfidious company. Second, how witches 
profess their sacrilege, and the oath of allegiance to the devil which they 
take. Third, how they are transported from place to place, either bodily or 
in the spirit. Fourth, how they subject themselves to Incubi, who are 
devils. Fifth, their general method of practising witchcraft through the 
Sacraments of the Church, and in particular how, with the permission of God, 
they can afflict all creatures except the Celestial Bodies. Sixth, their 
method of obstructing the generative function. Seventh, how they can take 
off the virile member by some art of illusion. Eighth, how they change men 
into the shapes of beasts. Ninth, how devils can enter the mind without 
hurting it, when they work some glamour or illusion. Tenth, how devils, 
through the operation of witches, sometimes substantially inhabit men. 
Eleventh, how they cause every sort of infirmity, and this in general. 
Twelfth, of certain infirmities in particular. Thirteenth, how witch 
midwives cause the greatest damage, either killing children or 
sacrilegiously offering them to devils. Fourteenth, how they cause various 
plagues to afflict animals. Fifteenth, how they raise hailstorms and 
tempests, and thunder and lightning, to fall upon men and animals. 
Sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth, the three ways in which men only, 
and not women, are addicted to witchcraft. After these will follow the 
question of the methods by which these sorts of witchcraft may be removed.
        But let no one think that, because we have enumerated the various 
methods by which various forms of witchcraft are inflicted, he will arrive 
at a complete knowledge of these practices; for such knowledge would be of 
little use, and might even be harmful. Not even the forbidden books of 
Necromancy contain such knowledge; for witchcraft is not taught in books, 
nor is it practised by the learned, but by the altogether uneducated; having 
only one foundation, without the acknowledgement or practice of which it is 
impossible for anyone to work witchcraft as a witch.
        Moreover, the methods are enumerated here at the beginning, that 
their deeds may not seem incredible, as they have often been though 
hitherto, to the great damage of the Faith, and the increase of witches 
themselves. But if anyone maintains that, since (as has been proved above) 
some men are protected by the influence of the stars so that they can be 
hurt by no witchcraft, it should also be attributed to the stars when anyone 
is bewitched, as if it were a matter of predestination whether a man can be 
immune from or subject to witchcraft, such a man does not rightly understand 
the meaning of the Doctors; and this in various respects.
        And first, because there are three human qualities which may be said 
to be ruled by three celestial causes, namely, the act of volition, the act 
of understanding, and bodily acts. And the first, as has been said, is 
governed directly and only by God; the second by an Angel; and the third is 
governed, but not compelled, by a celestial body.
        Secondly, it is clear from what has been said that choice and 
volition are governed directly by God, as S. Paul says: It is God Who 
causeth us to will and to perform, according to His good pleasure: and the 
understanding of the human intellect is ordered by God through the mediation 
of the Angels. Accordingly also all things corporeal, whether they be 
interior as are the powers and knowledge acquired through the inner bodily 
functions, or exterior as are sickness and health, are dispensed by the 
celestial bodies, through the mediation of Angels. And when Dionysius, in 
the fourth chapter de Diuinis Nominibus, says that the celestial bodies are 
the cause of that which happens in this world, this is to be understood as 
to natural health and sickness. But the sicknesses we are considering are 
supernatural, since they are inflicted by the power of the devil, with God's 
permission. Therefore we cannot say that it is due to the influence of the 
stars that a man is bewitched; although it can truly be said that it is due 
to the influence of the stars that some men cannot be bewitched.
        But if it is objected that these two opposite effects must spring 
from the same cause, and that the pendulum must swing both ways, it is 
answered that, when a man is preserved by the influence of the stars from 
these supernatural ills, this is not due directly to the influence of the 
stars, but to an angelic power, which can strengthen that influence so that 
the enemy with his malice cannot prevail against it; and that angelic power 
can be passed on through the virtue of the stars. For a man may be at the 
point of death, having reached the natural term of life, and God in His 
power, which in such matters always works indirectly, may alter this be 
sending some power of preservation instead of the natural defect in the man 
and in his dominating influence. Accordingly we may say of a man who is 
subject to witchcraft, that he can in just the same way be preserved from 
witchcraft, or that this preservation comes of an Angel deputed to guard 
him; and this is the chief of all means of protection.
        And when it is said in Jeremias xxii: Write ye this man childless, a 
man that shall not prosper in his days: this is to be understood with regard 
to the choices of the will, in which one man prospers and another does not; 
and this also can be ascribed to the influence of the stars. For example: 
one man may be influenced by his stars to make a useful choice, such as to 
enter some religious Order. And when his understanding is enlightened to 
consider such a step, and by Divine operation his will is inclined to put it 
into execution, such a man is said to prosper well. Or similarly when a man 
is inclined to some trade, or anything that is useful. On the other hand, he 
will be called unfortunate when his choice is inclined by the higher Powers 
to unprofitable things.
        S. Thomas, in his third book of the Summa against the Gentiles, and 
in several places, speaks of these and many other opinions, when he 
discusses in what lies the difference that one man should be well born and 
another unfortunately born, that a man should be lucky or unlucky, or well 
or badly governed and guarded. For according to the disposition of his stars 
a man is said to be well or badly born, and so fortunate or unfortunate; and 
according as he is enlightened by an Angel, and follows such enlightenment, 
he is said to be well or badly guarded. And according as he is directed by 
God towards good, and follows it, he is said to be well governed. But these 
choices have no place here, since we are not concerned with them but with 
the preservation from witchcraft; and we have said enough for the present on 
this subject. We proceed to the rites practised by witches, and first to a 
consideration of how they lure the innocent into becoming partakers of their 
perfidies. 




Chapter I  Of the several Methods by which Devils through Witches Entice and 
Allure the Innocent to the Increase of that Horrid Craft and Company.  

        There are three methods above all by which devils, through the 
agency of witches, subvert the innocent, and by which that perfidy is 
continually being increased. And the first is through weariness, through 
inflicting grievous losses in their temporal possessions. For, as S. Gregory 
says: The devil often tempts us to give way from very weariness. And it is 
to be understood that it is within the power of a man to resist such 
temptation; but that God permits it as a warning to us not to give way to 
sloth. And in this sense is Judges ii to be understood, where it says that 
God did not destroy those nations, that through them He might prove the 
people of Israel; and it speaks of the neighbouring nations of the 
Canaanites, Jebusites, and others. And in our time the Hussites and other 
Heretics are permitted, so that they cannot be destroyed. Devils, therefore, 
by means of witches, so afflict their innocent neighbours with temporal 
losses, that they are to beg the suffrages of witches, and at length to 
submit themselves to their counsels; as many experiences have taught us.
        We know a stranger in the diocese of Augsburg, who before he was 
forty-four years old lost all his horses in succession through witchcraft. 
His wife, being afflicted with weariness by reason of this, consulted with 
witches, and after following their counsels, unwholesome as they were, all 
the horses which he bought after that (for he was a carrier) were preserved 
from witchcraft.
        And how many women have complained to us in our capacity of 
Inquisitors, that when their cows have been injured by being deprived of 
their milk, or in any other way, they have consulted with suspected witches, 
and even been given remedies by them, on condition that they would promise 
something to some spirit; and when they asked what they would have to 
promise, the witches answered that it was only a small thing, that they 
should agree to execute the instructions of that master with regard to 
certain observances during the Holy Offices of the Church, or to observe 
some silent reservations in their confessions to priests.
        Here it is to be noted that, as has already been hinted, this 
iniquity has small and scant beginnings, as that of the time of the 
elevation of the Body of Christ they spit on the ground, or shut their eyes, 
or mutter some vain words. We know a woman who yet lives, protected by the 
secular law, who, when the priest at the celebration of the Mass blesses the 
people, saying, Dominus uobiscum, always adds to herself these words in the 
vulgar tongue “Kehr mir die Zung im Arss umb.” Or they even say some such 
thing at confession after they have received absolution, or do not confess 
everything, especially mortal sins, and so by slow degrees are led to a 
total abnegation of the Faith, and to the abominable profession of 
sacrilege.
        This, or something like it, is the method which witches use towards 
honest matrons who are little given to carnal vices but concerned for 
worldly profit. But towards young girls, more given to bodily lusts and 
pleasures, they observe a different method, working through their carnal 
desires and the pleasures of the flesh.
        Here it is to be noted that the devil is more eager and keen to 
tempt the good than the wicked, although in actual practice he tempts the 
wicked more than the good, because more aptitude for being tempted is found 
in the wicked than in the good. Therefore the devil tries all the harder to 
seduce all the more saintly virgins and girls; and there is reason in this, 
besides many examples of it.
        For since he already possesses the wicked, but not the good, he 
tries the harder to seduce into his power the good whom he does not, than 
the wicked whom he does, possess. Similarly any earthly prince takes up arms 
against those who do not acknowledge his rule rather than those who do not 
oppose him.
        And here is an example. Two witches were burned in Ratisbon, as we 
shall tell later where we treat of their methods of raising tempests. And 
one of them, who was a bath-woman, had confessed among other things the 
following: that she had suffered much injury from the devil for this reason. 
There was a certain devout virgin, the daughter of a very rich man whom 
there is no need to name, since the girl is now dead in the disposition of 
Divine mercy, and we would not that his thought should be perverted by evil; 
and the witch was ordered to seduce her by inviting her to her house on some 
Feast Day, in order that the devil himself, in the form of a young man, 
might speak with her. And although she had tried very often to accomplish 
this, yet whenever she had spoken to the young girl, she had protected 
herself with the sign of the Holy Cross. And no one can doubt that she did 
this at the instigation of a holy Angel, to repel the works of the devil.
        Another virgin living in the diocese of Strasburg confessed to one 
of us that she was alone on a certain Sunday in her father's house, when an 
old woman of that town came to visit here and, among other scurrilous words, 
made the following proposition; that, if she liked, she would take her to a 
place where there were some young men unknown to all the townsmen. And when, 
said the virgin, I consented, and followed her to her house, the old woman 
said, “See, we go upstairs to an upper room where the young men are; but 
take care not to make the sign of the Cross.” I gave her my promise not to 
do so, and as she was going up before me and I was going up the stairs, I 
secretly crossed myself. At the top of the stairs, when we were both 
standing outside the room, the hag turned angrily upon me with a horrible 
countenance, and looking at me said, “Curse you! Why did you cross yourself? 
Go away from here. Depart in the name of the devil.” And so I returned 
unharmed to my home.
        It can be seen from this how craftily that old enemy labours in the 
seduction of souls. For it was in this way that the bath-woman whom we have 
mentioned, and who was burned, confessed that she had been seduced by some 
old women. A different method, however, was used in the case of her 
companion witch, who had met the devil in human form on the road while she 
herself was going to visit her lover for the purpose of fornication. And 
when the Incubus devil had seen her, and has asked her whether she 
recognized him, and she had said that she did not, he had answered" “I am 
the devil; and if you wish, I will always be ready at your pleasure, and 
will not fail you in any necessity.” And when she had consented, she 
continued for eighteen years, up to the end of her life, to practise 
diabolical filthiness with him, together with a total abnegation of the 
Faith as a necessary condition.
        There is also a third method of temptation through the way of 
sadness and poverty. For when girls have been corrupted, and have been 
scorned by their lovers after they have immodestly copulated with them in 
the hope and promise of marriage with them, and have found themselves 
disappointed in all their hopes and everywhere despised, they turn to the 
help and protection of devils; either for the sake of vengeance by 
bewitching those lovers or the wives they have married, or for the sake of 
giving themselves up to every sort of lechery. Alas! experience tells us 
that there is no number to such girls, and consequently the witches that 
spring from this class are innumerable. Let us give a few out of many 
examples.
        There is a place in the diocese of Brixen where a young man deposed 
the following facts concerning the bewitchment of his wife.
        “In the time of my youth I loved a girl who importuned me to marry 
her; but I refused her and married another girl from another country. But 
wishing for friendship's sake to please her, I invited her to the wedding. 
She came, and while the other honest women were wishing us luck and offering 
gifts, she raised her hand and, in the hearing of the other women who were 
standing round, said, You will have few days of health after to-day. My 
bride was frightened, since she did not know her (for, as I have said, I had 
married her from another country), and asked the bystanders who she was who 
had threatened her in that way; and they said that she was a loose and 
vagrom woman. None the less, it happened just as she had said. For after a 
few days my wife was so bewitched that she lost the use of all her limbs, 
and even now, after ten years, the effects of witchcraft can be seen on her 
body.”
        If we were to collect all the similar instances which have occurred 
in one town of that diocese, it would take a whole book; but they are 
written and preserved at the house of the Bishop of Brixen, who still lives 
to testify to their truth, astounding and unheard-of though they are.
        But we must not pass over in silence one unheard-of and astonishing 
instance. A certain high-born Count in the ward of Westerich, in the diocese 
of Strasburg, married a noble girl of equal birth; but after he had 
celebrated the wedding, he was for three years unable to know her carnally, 
on account, as the event proved, of a certain charm which prevented him. In 
great anxiety, and not knowing what to do, he called loudly on the Saints of 
God. It happened that he went to the State of Metz to negotiate some 
business; and while he was talking about the streets and squares of the 
city, attended by his servants and domiciles, he met a certain women who had 
formerly been his mistress. Seeing her, and not at all thinking of the spell 
that was on him, he spontaneously addressed her kindly for the sake of their 
old friendship, asking her how she did, and whether she was well. And she, 
seeing the Count's gentleness, in her turn asked very particularly after his 
health and affairs; and when he answered that he was well, and that 
everything prospered with him, she was astonished and was silent for a time. 
The Count, seeing her thus astonished, again spoke kindly to her, inviting 
her to converse with him. So she inquired after his wife, and received a 
similar reply, that she was in all respects well. Then she asked if he had 
any children; and the Count said he had three sons, one born in each year. 
At that she was more astonished, and was again silent for a while. And the 
Count asked her, Why, my dear, do you make such careful inquiries? I am sure 
that you congratulate my on my happiness. Then she answered, Certainly I 
congratulate you; but curse that old woman who said she would bewitch your 
body so that you could not have connexion with your wife! And in proof of 
this, there is a pot in the well in the middle of your yard containing 
certain objects evilly bewitched, and this was placed there in order that, 
as long as its contents were preserved intact, for so long you would be 
unable to cohabit. But see! it is all in vain, and I am glad, etc. On his 
return home the Count did not delay to have the well drained; and, finding 
the pot, burned its contents and all, whereupon he immediately recovered the 
virility which he had lost. Wherefore the Countess again invited all the 
nobility to a fresh wedding celebration, saying that she was now the Lady of 
that castle and estate, after having for so long remained a virgin. For the 
sake of the Count's reputation it is not expedient to name that castle and 
estate; but we have related this story in order that the truth of the matter 
may be known, to bring so great a crime into open detestation.
        From this it is clear that witches use various methods to increase 
their numbers. For the above-mentioned woman, because she had been 
supplanted by the Count's wife, case that spell upon the Count with the help 
of another witches; and this is how one witchcraft brings innumerable others 
in its train. 




Chapter II  Of the Way whereby a Formal Pact with Evil is made.  

        The method by which they profess their sacrilege through an open 
pact of fidelity to devils varies according to the several practices to 
which different witches are addicted. And to understand this it first must 
be noted that there are, as was shown in the First Part of this treatise, 
three kinds of witches; namely, those who injure but cannot cure; those who 
cure but, through some strange pact with the devil, cannot injure; and those 
who both injure and cure. And among those who injure, one class in 
particular stands out, which can perform every sort of witchcraft and spell, 
comprehending all that all the others individually can do. Wherefore, if we 
describe the method of profession in their case, it will suffice also for 
all the other kinds. And this class is made up of those who, against every 
instinct of human or animal nature, are in the habit of eating and devouring 
the children of their own species.
        And this is the most powerful class of witches, who practise 
innumerable other harms also. For they raise hailstorms and hurtful tempests 
and lightnings; cause sterility in men and animals; offer to devils, or 
otherwise kill, the children whom they do not devour. But these are only the 
children who have not been re-born by baptism at the font, for they cannot 
devour those who have been baptized, nor any without God's permission. They 
can also, before the eyes of their parents, and when no one is in sight, 
throw into the water children walking by the water side; they make horses go 
mad under their riders; they can transport themselves from place to place 
through the air, either in body or in imagination; they can affect Judges 
and Magistrates so that they cannot hurt them; they can cause themselves and 
other to keep silence under torture; they can bring about a great trembling 
in the hands and horror in the minds of those who would arrest them; they 
can show to others occult things and certain future events, by the 
information of devils, though this may sometimes have a natural cause (see 
the question: Whether devils can foretell the future, in the Second Book of 
Sentences); they can see absent things as if they were present; they can 
turn the minds of men to inordinate love or hatred; they can at times strike 
whom they will with lightning, and even kill some men and animals; they can 
make of no effect the generative desires, and even the power of copulation, 
cause abortion, kill infants in the mother's womb by a mere exterior touch; 
they can at time bewitch men and animals with a mere look, without touching 
them, and cause death; they dedicate their own children to devils; and in 
short, as has been said, they can cause all the plagues which other witches 
can only cause in part, that is, when the Justice of God permits such things 
to be. All these things this most powerful of all classes of witches can do, 
but they cannot undo them.
        But it is common to all of them to practise carnal copulation with 
devils; therefore, if we show the method used by this chief class in their 
profession of their sacrilege, anyone may easily understand the method of 
the other classes.
        There were such witches lately, thirty years ago, in the district of 
Savoy, towards the State of Berne, as Nider tells in his Formicarius. And 
there are now some in the country of Lombardy, in the domains of the Duke of 
Austria, where the Inquisitor of Como, as we told in the former Part, caused 
forty-one witches to be burned in one year; and he was fifty-five years old, 
and still continues to labour in the Inquisition.
        Now the method of profession is twofold. One is a solemn ceremony, 
like a solemn vow. The other is private, and can be made to the devil at any 
hour alone. The first method is when witches meet together in the conclave 
on a set day, and the devil appears to them in the assumed body of a man, 
and urges them to keep faith with him, promising them worldly prosperity and 
length of life; and they recommend a novice to his acceptance. And the devil 
asks whether she will abjure the Faith, and forsake the holy Christian 
religion and the worship of the Anomalous Woman (for so they call the Most 
Blessed Virgin MARY), and never venerate the Sacraments; and if he finds the 
novice or disciple willing, then the devil stretches out his hand, and so 
does the novice, and she swears with upraised hand to keep that covenant. 
And when this is done, the devil at once adds that this is not enough; and 
when the disciple asks what more must be done, the devil demands the 
following oath of homage to himself: that she give herself to him, body and 
soul, for ever, and do her utmost to bring others of both sexes into his 
power. He adds, finally, that she is to make certain unguents from the bones 
and limbs of children, especially those who have been baptized; by all which 
means she will be able to fulfil all her wishes with his help.
        We Inquisitors had credible experience of this method in the town of 
Breisach in the diocese of Basel, receiving full information from a young 
girl witch who had been converted, whose aunt also had been burned in the 
diocese of Strasburg. And she added that she had become a witch by the 
method in which her aunt had first tried to seduce her.
        For one day her aunt ordered her to go upstairs with her, and at her 
command to go into a room where she found fifteen young men clothed in green 
garments after the manner of German knights. And her aunt said to her: 
Choose whom you wish from these young men, and he will take you for his 
wife. And when she said she did not wish or any of them, she was sorely 
beaten and at last consented, and was initiated according to the aforesaid 
ceremony. She said also that she was often transported by night with her 
aunt over vast distances, even from Strasburg to Cologne.
        This is she who occasioned our inquiry in the First Part into the 
question whether witches are truly and bodily transported by devils from 
place to place: and this was on account of the words of the Canon (6, q. 5, 
Episcopi), which seem to imply that they are only so carried in imagination; 
whereas they are at times actually and bodily transported.
        For when she was asked whether it was only in imagination and 
phantastically that they so rode, through an illusion of devils, she 
answered that they did so in both ways; according to the truth which we 
shall declare later of the manner in which they are transferred from place 
to place. She said also that the greatest injuries were inflicted by 
midwives, because they were under an obligation to kill or offer to devils 
as many children as possible; and that she had been severely beaten by her 
aunt because she had opened a secret pot and found the heads of a great many 
children. And much more she told us, having first, as was proper, taken an 
oath to speak the truth.
        And he account of the method of professing the devil's faith 
undoubtedly agrees with what has been written by that most eminent Doctor, 
John Nider, who even in our times has written very illuminatingly; and it 
may be especially remarked that he tells of the following which he had from 
an Inquisitor of the diocese of Edua, who held many inquisitions on witches 
in that diocese, and caused many to be burned.
        For he says that this Inquisitor told him that in the Duchy of 
Lausanne certain witches had cooked and eaten their own children, and that 
the following was the method in which they became initiated into such 
practices. The witches met together and, by their art, summoned a devil in 
the form of a man, to whom the novice was compelled to swear to deny the 
Christian religion, never to adore the Eucharist, and to tread the Cross 
underfoot whenever she could do so secretly.
        Here is another example from the same source. There was lately a 
general report, brought to the notice of Peter the Judge in Boltingen, that 
thirteen infants had been devoured in the State of Berne; and the public 
justice exacted full vengeance on the murderers. And when Peter asked one of 
the captive witches in what manner they ate children, she replied: “This is 
the manner of it. We set our snares chiefly for unbaptized children, and 
even for those that have been baptized, especially when they have not been 
protected by the sign of the Cross and prayers” (Reader, notice that, at the 
devil's command, they take the unbaptized chiefly, in order that they may 
not be baptized), “and with our spells we kill them in their cradles or even 
when they are sleeping by their parents' side, in such a way that they 
afterwards are thought to have been overlain or to have died some other 
natural death. Then we secretly take them from their graves, and cook them 
in a cauldron, until the whole flesh comes away from the bones to make a 
soup which may easily be drunk. Of the more solid matter we make an unguent 
which is of virtue to help us in our arts and pleasures and our 
transportations; and with the liquid we fill a flask or skin, whoever drinks 
from which, with the addition of a few other ceremonies, immediately 
acquires much knowledge and becomes a leader in our sect.”
        Here is another very clear and distinct example. A young man and his 
wife, both witches, were imprisoned in Berne; and the man, shut up by 
himself apart from her in a separate tower, said: “If I could obtain pardon 
for my sins, I would willingly declare all that I know about witchcraft; for 
I see that I ought to die.” And when he was told by the learned clerks who 
were there that he could obtain complete pardon if he truly repented, he 
joyfully resigned himself to death, and laid bare the method by which he had 
first been infected with his heresy. “The following,” he said, “is the 
manner in which I was seduced. It is first necessary that, on a Sunday 
before the consecration of Holy Water, the novice should enter the church 
with the masters, and there in their presence deny Christ, his Faith, 
baptism, and the whole Church. And then he must pay homage to the Little 
Master, for so and not otherwise do they call the devil.” Here it is to be 
noted that this method agrees with those that have been recounted; for it is 
immaterial whether the devil is himself present or not, when homage is 
offered to him. For this he does in his cunning, perceiving the temperament 
of the novice, who might be frightened by his actual presence into 
retracting his vows, whereas he would be more easily persuaded to consent by 
those who are known to him. And therefore they call him the Little Master 
when he is absent, that through seeming disparagement of his Master the 
novice may feel less fear. “And then he drinks from the skin, which has been 
mentioned, and immediately feels within himself a knowledge of all our arts 
and an understanding of our rites and ceremonies. And in this manner was I 
seduced. But I believe my wife to be so obstinate that she would rather go 
straight to the fire than confess the smallest part of the truth; but, alas! 
we are both guilty.” And as the young man said, so it happened in every 
respect. For the young man confessed and was seen to die in the greatest 
contrition; but the wife, though convicted by witnesses, would not confess 
any of the truth, either under torture or in death itself; but when the fire 
had been prepared by the gaoler, cursed him in the most terrible words, and 
so was burned. And from these examples their method of initiation in solemn 
conclave is made clear.
        The other private method is variously performed. For sometimes when 
men or women have been involved in some bodily or temporal affliction, the 
devil comes to them speaking to them in person, and at times speaking to 
them through the mouth of someone else; and he promises that, if they will 
agree to his counsels, he will do for them whatever they wish. But he starts 
from small things, as was said in the first chapter, and leads gradually to 
the bigger things. We could mention many examples which have come to our 
knowledge in the Inquisition, but, since this matter presents no difficulty, 
it can briefly be included with the previous matter. 

A Few Points are to be Noticed in the Explanation of their Oath of Homage. 

        Now there are certain points to be noted concerning the homage which 
the devil exacts, as, namely, for what reason and in what different ways he 
does this. It is obvious that his principal motive is to offer the greater 
offence to the Divine Majesty by usurping to himself a creature dedicated to 
God, and thus more certainly to ensure his disciple's future damnation, 
which is his chief object. Nevertheless, it is often found by us that he has 
received such homage for a fixed term of years at the time of the profession 
of perfidy; and sometimes he exacts the profession only, postponing the 
homage to a later day.
        And let us declare that the profession consists in a total or 
partial abnegation of the Faith: total, as has been said before, when the 
Faith is entirely abjured; partial, when the original pact makes it 
incumbent on the witch to observe certain ceremonies in opposition to the 
decrees of the Church, such as fasting on Sundays, eating meat on Fridays, 
concealing certain crimes at confession, or some such profane thing. But let 
us declare that homage consists in the surrender of body and soul.
        And we can assign four reasons why the devil requires the practice 
of such things. For we showed in the First Part of this treatise, when we 
examined whether devils could turn the minds of men to love or hatred, that 
they cannot enter the inner thoughts of the heart, since this belongs to God 
alone. But the devil can arrive at a knowledge of men's thoughts by 
conjecture, as will be shown later. Therefore, if that cunning enemy sees 
that a novice will be hard to persuade, he approaches her gently, exacting 
only small things that he may gradually lead her to greater things.
        Secondly, it must be believed that there is some diversity among 
those who deny the Faith, since some do so with their lips but not in their 
heart, and some both with their lips and in their heart. Therefore the 
devil, wishing to know whether their profession comes from the heart as well 
as from the lips, sets them a certain period, so that he may understand 
their minds from their works and behaviour.
        Thirdly, if after the lapse of a set time he find that she is less 
willing to perform certain practices, and is bound to him only by word but 
not in her heart, he presumes that the Divine Mercy has given her the 
guardianship of a good Angel, which he knows to be of great power. Then he 
casts her off, and tries to expose her to temporal afflictions, so that he 
gain some profit from her despair. 

        The truth of this is clear. For if it is asked why some witches will 
not confess the truth under even the greatest tortures, while other readily 
confess their crimes when they are questioned (and some of them, after they 
have confessed, try to kill themselves by hanging), the reason is as 
follows. It may truly be said that, when it is not due to a Divine impulse 
conveyed through a holy Angel that a witch is made to confess the truth and 
abandon the spell of silence, then it is due to the devil whether she 
preserves silence of confesses her crimes. The former is the case with those 
whom he knows to have denied the Faith both with their lips and in their 
hearts, and also to have given him their homage; for he is sure of their 
constancy. But in the latter case he withdraws his protection, since he 
knows that they are of no profit to him.
        We have often learned from the confessions of those whom we have 
caused to be burned, that they have not been willing agents of witchcraft. 
And they have not said this in the hope of escaping damnation, for its truth 
is witnessed by the blows and stripes which they have received from devils 
when they have been unwilling to perform their orders, and we have often 
seen their swollen and livid faces. Similarly, after they have confessed 
their crimes under torture they always try to hang themselves; and this we 
know for a fact; for after the confession of their crimes, guards are 
deputed to watch them all the time, and even then, when the guards have been 
negligent, they have been found hanged with their shoe-laces or garments. 
For, as we have said, they devil causes this, lest they should obtain pardon 
through contrition or sacramental confession; and those whose hearts he 
cannot seduce from finding grace with God, he tries to lead into despair 
through worldly loss and a horrible death. However, through the great grace 
of God, as it is pious to believe, they can obtain forgiveness by true 
contrition and pure confession, when they have not been willing 
participators in those foul and filthy practices.
        This is exemplified by certain events which took place hardly three 
years ago in the dioceses of Strasburg and Constance, and in the towns of 
Hagenau and Ratisbon. For in the first town one hanged herself with a 
trifling and flimsy garment. Another, named Walpurgis, was notorious for her 
power of preserving silence, and used to teach other women how to achieve a 
like quality of silence by cooking their first-born sons in an oven. Many 
such examples are to our hand, as they are also in the case of others burned 
in the second town, some of which will be related.
        And there is a forth reason why the devil exacts a varying degree of 
homage, making it relatively small in some cases because he is more skilful 
than Astronomers in knowing the length if human life, and so can easily fix 
a term which he knows will be preceded by death, or can, in the manner 
already told, forestall natural death with some accident.
        All this, in short, can be shown by the actions and behaviour of 
witches. But first we can deduce the astuteness of the devil in such things. 
For according to S. Augustine in the de Natura Daemonis seven reasons are 
assigned why devils can conjecture probable future events, though they 
cannot know them certainly. The first is that they have a natural subtlety 
in their understanding, by which they arrive at their knowledge without the 
process of reasoning which is necessary for us. Secondly, by their long 
experience and by revelation of supernal spirits, they know more than we do. 
For S. Isidore says that the Doctors have often affirmed that devils derive 
their marvellous cunning from three sources, their natural subtlety, their 
long experience, and the revelation of supernal spirits. The third reason is 
their rapidity of motion, by which they can with miraculous speed anticipate 
in the West things which are happening in the East. Fourthly, just as they 
are able, with God's permission, to cause disease and famines, so also they 
can predict them. Fifthly, they can more cunningly read the signs of death 
than a physician can by looking at the urine or feeling the pulse. For just 
as a physician sees signs in a sick man which a layman would not notice, so 
the devil sees what no man can naturally see. Sixthly, they can by signs 
which proceed from a man's mind conjecture more astutely than the wisest men 
what is or will be in that man's mind. For they know what impulses, and 
therefore what actions, will probably follow. Seventhly, they understand 
better than men the acts and writings of the Prophets, and, since on these 
much of the future depends, they can foretell from them much that will 
happen. Therefore it is not wonderful that they can know the natural term of 
a man's life; though it is different in the case of the accidental term when 
a witch is burned; for this the devil ultimately causes when, as has been 
said, he finds a witch reluctant, and fears for her conversion; whereas he 
protects even up to their natural death others whom he knows to be his 
willing agents.
        Let us give examples of both these cases, which are known to us. 
There was in the diocese of Basel, in a town called Oberweiler situated on 
the Rhine, an honest parish priest, who fondly held the opinion, or rather 
error, that there was no witchcraft in the world, but that it only existed 
in the imagination of men who attributed such things to witches. And God 
wished so to purge him of this error that he might even be made aware of the 
practice of devils in setting a term to the lives of witches. For as he was 
hastening to cross a bridge, on some business that he had to do, he met a 
certain old woman in his hurry, and would not give way to her, but pressed 
on so that he thrust the old woman into the mud. She indignantly broke into 
a flood of abuse, and said to him, “Father, you will not cross with 
impunity.” And though he took small notice of those words, in the night, 
when he wished to get out of his bed, he felt himself bewitched below the 
waist, so that he always had to be supported by the arms of other men when 
he wished to go to the church; and so he remained for three years, under the 
care of his own mother. After that time the old woman fell sick, the hag 
whom he had always suspected as being the cause of his witchcraft, owing to 
the abusive words with which she had threatened him; and it happened that 
she sent to him to hear her confession. And though the priest angrily said, 
“Let her confess to the devil her master,” yet, at the instance of his 
mother, he went to the house supported by two servants, and sat at the head 
of the bed where the witch lay. And the two servants listened outside the 
window, so eager were they to know whether she would confess that she had 
bewitched the priest. Now it happened that, though she made no mention in 
her confession of having been the cause of his malady, after the confession 
was finished, she said, “Father, do you know who bewitched you?” And when he 
gently answered that he did not, she added, “You suspect me, and with 
reason; for know that I brought it upon you for this reason,” explaining as 
we have already told. And when he begged to be liberated, she said, “Lo! the 
set time has come, and I must die; but I will so cause it that in a few 
days, after my death, you will be healed.” And so it happened. For she died 
at the time fixed by the devil, and within thirty days the priest found 
himself completely healed in one night. The name of that priest is Father 
Hässlin, and he lives yet in the diocese of Strasburg.
        Similarly in the diocese of Basel, in the village called Buchel, 
near the town of Gewyll, this happened. A certain woman was taken, and 
finally burned, who for six years had had an Incubus devil, even when she 
was lying in bed by the side of her husband. And this she did three times a 
week, on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, and on some of the other more 
holy nights. But the homage she had given to the devil was of such a sort 
that she was bound to dedicate herself body and soul to him for ever, after 
seven years. But God provided mercifully: for she was taken in the sixth 
year and condemned to the fire, and having truly and completely confessed, 
is believed to have obtained pardon from God. For she went most willingly to 
her death, saying that she would gladly suffer an even more terrible death, 
if only she could be set free from and escape the power of the devil. 




Chapter III  How they are Transported from Place to Place.  

        And now we must consider their ceremonies and in what manner they 
proceed in their operations, first in respect of their actions towards 
themselves and in their own persons. And among their chief operations are 
being bodily transported from place to place, and to practise carnal 
connexion with Incubus devils, which we shall treat of separately, beginning 
with their bodily vectification. But here it must be noted that this 
transvection offers a difficulty, which has often been mentioned, arising 
from one single authority, where it is said: It cannot be admitted as true 
that certain wicked women, perverted by Satan and seduced by the illusions 
and phantasms of devils, do actually, as they believe and profess, ride in 
the night-time on certain beasts with Diana, a goddess of the Pagans, or 
with Herodias and an innumerable multitude of women, and in the untimely 
silence of night pass over immense tracts of land, and have to obey her in 
all things as their Mistress, etc. Wherefore the priest of God ought to 
preach to the people that this is altogether false, and that such phantasms 
are sent not by God, but by an evil Spirit to confuse the minds of the 
faithful. For Satan himself transforms himself into various shapes and 
forms; and by deluding in dreams the mind which he holds captive, leads it 
through devious ways, etc.
        And there are those who, taking their example from S. Germain and a 
certain other man who kept watch over his daughter to determine this matter, 
sometimes preach that this is an altogether impossible thing; and that it is 
indiscreet to ascribe to witches and their operations such levitations, as 
well as the injuries which happen to men, animals, and the fruits of the 
earth; since just as they are the victims of phantasy in their 
transvections, so also are they deluded in the matter of the harm they wreak 
on living creatures.
        But this opinion was refuted as heretical in the First Question; for 
it leaves out of account the Divine permission with regard to the devil's 
power, which extends to even greater things than this: and it is contrary to 
the meaning of Sacred Scripture, and has caused intolerable damage to Holy 
Church, since now for many years, thanks to this pestiferous doctrine, 
witches have remained unpunished, because the secular courts have lost their 
power to punish them. Therefore the diligent reader will consider what was 
there set down for the stamping out of that opinion, and will for the 
present note how they are transported, and in what ways this is possible, of 
which some examples will be adduced.
        It is shown in various ways that they can be bodily transported; and 
first, from the operations of other Magicians. For if they could not be 
transported, it would either be because God does not permit it, or because 
the devil cannot do this since it is contrary to nature. It cannot be for 
the first reason, for both greater and less things can be done by the 
permission of God; and greater things are often done both to children and 
men, even to just men confirmed in grace.
        For when it is asked whether substitutions of children can be 
affected by the work of devils, and whether the devil can carry a man from 
place to place even against his will; to the first question the answer is, 
Yes. For William of Paris says in the last part of his De Uniuerso: 
Substitutions of children are, with God's permission, possible, so that the 
devil can affect a change of the child or even a transformation. For such 
children are always miserable and crying; and although four or five mothers 
could hardly support enough milk for them, they never grow fat, yet are 
heavy beyond the ordinary. But this should neither be affirmed nor denied to 
women, on account of the great fear which it may cause them, but they should 
be instructed to ask the opinion of learned men. For God permits this on 
account of the sins of the parents, in that sometimes men curse their 
pregnant wives, saying, May you be carrying a devil! or some such thing. In 
the same way impatient women often say something of the sort. And many 
examples have been given by other men, some of them pious men.
        For Vincent of Beauvais (Spec. Hist., XXVI, 43) related a story told 
by S. Peter Damian of a five-year-old son of a nobleman, who was for the 
time living in a monastery; and one night he was carried out of the 
monastery into a locked mill, where he was found in the morning. And when he 
was questioned, he said that he had been carried by some men to a great 
feast and bidden to eat; and afterwards he was put into the mill through the 
roof.
        And what of those Magicians whom we generally call Necromancers, who 
are often carried through the air by devils for long distances? And 
sometimes they even persuade others to go with them on a horse, which is not 
really a horse but a devil in that form, and, as they say, thus warn their 
companions not to make the sign of the Cross.
        And though we are two who write this book, one of us has very often 
seen and known such men. For there is a man who was once a scholar, and is 
now believed to be a priest in the diocese of Freising, who used to say that 
at one time he had been bodily carried through the air by a devil, and taken 
to the most remote parts.
        There lives another priest in Oberdorf, a town near Landshut, who 
was at that time a friend of that one of us, who saw with his own eyes such 
a transportation, and tells how the man was borne on high with arms 
stretched out, shouting but not whimpering. And the cause, as he tells it, 
was as follows. A number of scholars had met together to drink beer, and 
they all agreed that the one who fetched the beer should not have to pay 
anything. And so one of them was going to fetch the beer, and on opening the 
door saw a thick cloud before the grunsel, and returning in terror told his 
companions why he would not go for the drink. Then that one of them who was 
carried away said angrily: “Even if the devil were there, I shall fetch the 
drink.” And, going out, he was carried through the air in the sight of all 
the others.
        And indeed it must be confessed that such things can happen not only 
to those who are awake, but also to men who are asleep; namely, they can be 
bodily transported through the air while they are fast asleep.
        This is clear in the case of certain men who walk in their sleep on 
the roofs of houses and over the highest buildings, and no one can oppose 
their progress either on high or below. And if they are called by their own 
names by the other bystanders, they immediately fall crashing to the ground.
        Many think, and not without reason, that this is devils' work. For 
devils are of many different kinds, and some, who fell from the lower choir 
of Angels, are tortured as if for smaller sins with lighter punishments as 
well as the punishment of damnation which they must suffer eternally. And 
these cannot hurt anybody, at least not seriously, but for the most part 
carry out only practical jokes. And others are Incubi or Succubi, who punish 
men in the night, defiling them in the sin of lechery. It is not wonderful 
if they are given also to horse-play such as this.
        The truth can be deduced from the words of Cassian, Collationes I, 
where he says that there is no doubt that there are as many different 
unclean spirits as there are different desires in men. For it is manifest 
that some of them, which the common people call Fauns, and we call Trolls, 
which abound in Norway, are such buffoons and jokers that they haunt certain 
places and roads and, without being able to do any hurt to those who pass 
by, are content with mocking and deluding them, and try to weary them rather 
than hurt them. And some of them only visit men with harmless nightmares. 
But others are so furious and truculent that they are not content to afflict 
with an atrocious dilation the bodies of those whom they inflate, but even 
come rushing from on high and hasten to strike them with the most savage 
blows. Our author means that they do not only possess men, but torture them 
horribly, as did those which are described in S. Matthew viii.
        From this we can conclude, first that it must not be said that 
witches cannot be locally transported because God does not permit it. For if 
He permits it in the case of the just and innocent, and of other Magicians, 
how should He not in the case of those who are totally dedicated to the 
devil? And we say with all reverence: Did not the devil take up Our Saviour, 
and carry Him up to a high place, as the Gospel testifies?
        Neither can the second argument of our opponents be conceded, that 
the devil cannot do this thing. For it has already been shown that he has so 
great natural power, exceeding all corporeal power, that there is no earthly 
power that can be compared with him; as it is said: “There is no power on 
earth that can be compared with him,” etc. Indeed the natural power or 
virtue which is in Lucifer is so great that there is none greater among the 
good Angels in Heaven. For just as he excelled all the Angels in his nature, 
and not his nature, but only his grace, was diminished by his Fall, so that 
nature still remains in him, although it is darkened and bound. Wherefore 
the gloss on that “There is no power on earth” says: Although he excels all 
things, yet he is subject to the merits of the Saints.
        Two objections which someone may bring forward are not valid. First, 
that man's soul could resist him, and that the text seems to speak of one 
devil in particular, since it speaks in the singular, namely Lucifer. And 
because it was he who tempted Christ in the wilderness, and seduced the 
first man, he is now bound in chains. And the other Angels are not so 
powerful, since he excels them all. Therefore the other spirits cannot 
transport wicked men through the air from place to place.
        These arguments have no force. For, to consider the Angels first, 
even the least Angel is incomparably superior to all human power, as can be 
proved in many ways. First, a spiritual is stronger than a corporeal power, 
and so is the power of an Angel, or even of the soul, greater than that of 
the body. Secondly, as to the soul; every bodily shape owes its 
individuality to matter, and, in the case of human beings, to the fact that 
a soul informs it; but immaterial forms are absolute intelligences, and 
therefore have an absolute and more universal power. For this reason, the 
soul when joined to the body cannot in this way suddenly transfer its body 
locally or raise it up in the air; although it could easily do so, with 
God's permission, if it were separate from its body. Much more, then, is 
this possible to an entirely immaterial spirit, such as a good or bad Angel. 
For a good Angel transported Habacuc in a moment from Judaea to Chaldaea. 
And for this reason it is concluded that those who by night are carried in 
their sleep over high buildings are not carried by their own souls, nor by 
the influence of the stars, but by some mightier power, as was shown above.
        Thirdly, it is the nature of the body to be moved, as to place, 
directly by a spiritual nature; and, as Aristotle says, Physics, VIII, local 
motion is the first of bodily motions; and he proves this by saying that 
local motion is not intrinsically in the power of any body as such, but is 
due to some exterior force.
        Wherefore it is concluded, not so much from the holy Doctors as from 
the Philosophers, that the highest bodies, that is, the stars, are moved by 
spiritual essences, and by separate Intelligences which are good both by 
nature and in intention. For we see that the soul is the prime and chief 
cause of local motion in the body.
        It must be said, therefore, that neither in its physical capacity 
nor in that of its soul can the human body resist being suddenly transported 
from place to place, with God's permission, by a spiritual essence good both 
in intention and by nature, when the good, who are confirmed in grace, are 
transported; or by an essence good by nature, but not good in intention, 
when the wicked are transported. Any who wish may refer to S. Thomas in 
three articles in Part I, question 90, and again in his question concerning 
Sin, and also in the Second Book of Sentences, dist. 7, on the power of 
devils over bodily effects.
        Now the following is their method of being transported. They take 
the unguent which, as we have said, they make at the devil's instruction 
from the limbs of children, particularly of those whom they have killed 
before baptism, and anoint with it a chair or a broomstick; whereupon they 
are immediately carried up into the air, either by day or by night, and 
either visibly or, if they wish, invisibly; for the devil can conceal a body 
by the interposition of some other substance, as was shown in the First Part 
of the treatise where we spoke of the glamours and illusions caused by the 
devil. And although the devil for the most part performs this by means of 
this unguent, to the end that children should be deprived of the grace of 
baptism and of salvation, yet he often seems to affect the same transvection 
without its use. For at times he transports the witches on animals, which 
are not true animals but devils in that form; and sometimes even without any 
exterior help they are visibly carried solely by the operation of the 
devil's power.
        Here is an instance of a visible transportation in the day-time. In 
the town of Waldshut on the Rhine, in the diocese of Constance, there was a 
certain witch who was so detested by the townsfolk that she was not invited 
to the celebration of a wedding which, however, nearly all the other 
townsfolk were present. Being indignant because of this, and wishing to be 
revenged, she summoned a devil and, telling him the cause of her vexation, 
asked him to raise a hailstorm and drive all the wedding guests from their 
dancing; and the devil agreed, and raising her up, carried her through the 
air to a hill near the town, in the sight of some shepherds. And since, as 
she afterwards confessed, she had no water to pour into the trench (for 
this, as we shall show, is the method they use to raise hailstorms), she 
made a small trench and filled it with her urine instead of water, and 
stirred it with her finger, after their custom, with the devil standing by. 
Then the devil suddenly raised that liquid up and sent a violent storm of 
hailstones which fell only on the dancers and townsfolk. And when they had 
dispersed and were discussing among themselves the cause of that storm, the 
witch shortly afterwards entered the town; and this greatly aroused their 
suspicions. But when the shepherds had told what they had seen, their 
suspicions became almost a certainty. So she was arrested, and confessed 
that she had done this thing because she had not been invited to the 
wedding: and for this, and for many other witchcrafts which she had 
perpetrated, she was burned. 

        And since the public report of this sort of transvection is 
continually being spread even among the common people, it is unnecessary to 
add further proof of it here. But we hope that this will suffice to refute 
those who either deny altogether that there are such transvections, or try 
to maintain that they are only imaginary or phantastical. And, indeed, it 
would be a matter of small importance if such men were left in their error, 
were it not that this error tends to the damage of the Faith. For notice 
that, not content with that error, they do not fear to maintain and publish 
others also, to the increase of witches and the detriment of the Faith. For 
they assert that all the witchcraft which is truly and actually ascribed to 
witches as instruments of the devil is only so ascribed in imagination and 
illusion, as if they were really harmless, just as their transvection is 
only phantastic. And for this reason many witches remain unpunished, to the 
great dispraise of the Creator, and to their own most heavy increase.
        The arguments on which they base their fallacy cannot be conceded. 
For first they advance the chapter of the Canon (Episcopi, 26, q. 5), where 
it is said that witches are only transported in imagination; but who is so 
foolish as to conclude from this that they cannot also be bodily 
transported? Similarly at the end of that chapter it is set down that 
whoever believes that a man can be changed for the better or the worse, or 
can be transformed into another shape, is to be thought worse than an 
infidel or a pagan; but who could conclude from this that men cannot be 
transformed into beasts by a glamour, or that they cannot be changed from 
health to sickness and from better to worse? They who so scratch at the 
surface of the words of the Canon hold an opinion which is contrary to that 
of all the holy Doctors, and, indeed, against the teaching of the Holy 
Scripture.
        For the contrary opinion is abundantly proved by what has been 
written in various places in the First Part of this treatise; and it is 
necessary to study the inner meaning of the words of the Canon. And this was 
examined in the First Question of the First Part of the treatise, in 
refuting the second of three errors which are there condemned, and where it 
is said that four things are to be preached to the people. For they are 
transported both bodily and phantastically, as is proved by their own 
confessions, not only of those who have been burned, but also of others who 
have returned to penitence and the Faith.
        Among such there was the woman in the town of Breisach whom we asked 
whether they could be transported only in imagination, or actually in the 
body; and she answered that it was possible in both ways. For if they do not 
wish to be bodily transferred, but want to know all that is being done in a 
meeting of their companions, then they observe the following procedure. In 
the name of all the devils they lie down to sleep on their left side, and 
then a sort of bluish vapour comes from their mouth, through which they can 
clearly see what is happening. But if they wish to be bodily transported, 
they must observe the method which has been told.
        Besides, even if that Canon be understood in its bare meaning 
without any explanation, who is so dense as to maintain on that account that 
all their witchcraft and injuries are phantastic and imaginary, when the 
contrary is evident to the senses of everybody? Especially since there are 
many species of superstition, namely, fourteen; among which the species of 
witches holds the highest degree in spells and injuries, and the species of 
Pythoness, to which they can be reduced, which is only able to be 
transported in imagination, holds the lowest degree.
        And we do not concede that their error can be substantiated by the 
Legends of S. Germain and certain others. For it was possible for the devils 
to lie down themselves by the side of the sleeping husbands, during the time 
when a watch was being kept on the wives, just as if they were sleeping with 
their husbands. And we do not say that this was done for any reverence felt 
for the Saint; but the case is put that the opposite of what is set down in 
the Legend may not be believed to be impossible.
        In the same way all other objections can be answered: that it is 
found that some witches are transported only in imagination, but that it is 
also found in the writings of the Doctors that many have been bodily 
transported. Whoever wishes may refer to Thomas of Brabant in his book about 
Bees, and he will find many wonderful things concerning both the imaginary 
and the bodily transvection of men. 




Chapter IV  Here follows the Way whereby Witches copulate with those Devils 
known as Incubi.  

        As to the method in which witches copulate with Incubus devils, six 
points are to be noted. First, as to the devil and the body which he 
assumes, of what element it is formed. Second, as to the act, whether it is 
always accompanied with the injection of semen received from some other man. 
Third, as to the time and place, whether one time is more favourable than 
another for this practice. Fourth, whether the act is visible to the women, 
and whether only those who were begotten in this way are so visited by 
devils. Fifth, whether it applies only to those who were offered to the 
devil at birth by midwives. Sixth, whether the actual venereal pleasure is 
greater or less in this act. And we will speak first of the matter and 
quality of the body which the devil assumes.
        It must be said that he assumes an aerial body, and that it is in 
some respects terrestrial, in so far as it has an earthly property through 
condensation; and this is explained as follows. The air cannot of itself 
take definite shape, except the shape of some other body in which it is 
included. And in that case it is not bound by its own limits, but by those 
of something else; and one part of the air continues into the next part. 
Therefore he cannot simply assume an aerial body as such.
        Know, moreover, that the air is in every way a most changeable and 
fluid matter: and a sign of this is the fact that when any have tried to cut 
or pierce with a sword the body assumed by a devil, they have not been able 
to; for the divided parts of the air at once join together again. From this 
it follows that air is in itself a very competent matter, but because it 
cannot take shape unless some other terrestrial matter is joined with it, 
therefore it is necessary that the air which forms the devil's assumed body 
should be in some way inspissated, and approach the property of the earth, 
while still retaining its true property as air. And devils and disembodied 
spirits can effect this condensation by means of gross vapours raised from 
the earth, and by collecting them together into shapes in which they abide, 
not as defilers of them, but only as their motive power which give to that 
body the formal appearance of life, in very much the same way as the soul 
informs the body to which it is joined. They are, moreover, in these assumed 
and shaped bodies like a sailor in a ship which the wind moves.
        So when it is asked of what sort is the body assumed by the devil, 
it is to be said that with regard to its material, it is one thing to speak 
of the beginning of its assumption, and another thing to speak of its end. 
For in the beginning it is just air; but in the end it is inspisated air, 
partaking of some of the properties of the earth. And all this the devils, 
with God's permission, can do of their own nature; for the spiritual nature 
is superior to the bodily. Therefore the bodily nature must obey the devils 
in respect of local motion, though not in respect of the assumption of 
natural shapes, either accidental or substantial, except in the case of some 
small creatures (and then only with the help of some other agent, as has 
been hinted before). But as to local motion, no shape is beyond their power; 
thus they can move them as they wish, in such circumstances as they will.
        From this there may arise an incidental question as to what should 
be thought when a good or bad Angel performs some of the functions of life 
by means of true natural bodies, and not in aerial bodies; as in the case of 
Balaam's ass, through which the Angel spoke, and when the devils take 
possession of bodies. It is to be said that those bodies are not called 
assumed, but occupied. See S. Thomas, II. 8, Whether Angels assume bodies. 
But let us keep strictly to our argument.
        In what way is it to be understood that devils talk with witches, 
see them, hear them, eat with them, and copulate with them? And this is the 
second part of this first difficulty.
        For the first, it is to be said that three things are required for 
true conversation: namely, lungs to draw in the air; and this is not only 
for the sake of producing sound, but also to cool the heart; and even mutes 
have this necessary quality.
        Secondly, it is necessary that some percussion be made of a body in 
the air, as a greater or less sound is made when one beats wood in the airs, 
or rings a bell. For when a substance that is susceptible to sound is struck 
by a sound-producing instrument, it gives out a sound according to its size, 
which is received in the air and multiplied to the ears of the hearer, to 
whom, if he is far off, it seems to come through space.
        Thirdly, a voice is required; and it may be said that what is called 
Sound in inanimate bodies is called Voice in living bodies. And here the 
tongue strikes the respirations of air against an instrument or living 
natural organ provided by God. And this is not a bell, which is called a 
sound, whereas this is a voice. And this third requisite may clearly be 
exemplified by the second; and I have set this down that preachers may have 
a method of teaching the people.
        And fourthly, it is necessary that he who forms the voice should 
mean to express by means of that voice some concept of the mind to someone 
else, and that he should himself understand what he is saying; and so manage 
his voice by successively striking his teeth with his tongue in his mouth, 
by opening and shutting his lips, and by sending the air struck in his mouth 
into the outer air, that in this way the sound is reproduced in order in the 
ears of the hearer, who then understands his meaning.
        To return to the point. Devils have no lungs or tongue, though they 
can show the latter, as well as teeth and lips, artificially made according 
to the condition of their body; therefore they cannot truly and properly 
speak. But since they have understanding, and when they wish to express 
their meaning, then, by some disturbance of the air included in their 
assumed body, not of air breathed in and out as in the case of men, they 
produce, not voices, but sounds which have some likeness to voices, and send 
them articulately through the outside air to the ears of the hearer. And 
that the likeness of a voice can be made without respiration of air is clear 
from the case of other animals which do not breathe, but are said to made a 
sound, as do also certain other instruments, as Aristotle says in the de 
Anima. For certain fishes, when they are caught, suddenly utter a cry 
outside the water, and die.
        All this is applicable to what follows, so far as the point where we 
treat of the generative function, but not as regards good Angels. If anyone 
wishes to inquire further into the matter of devils speaking in possessed 
bodies, he may refer to S. Thomas in the Second Book of Sentences, dist. 8, 
art. 5. For in that case they use the bodily organs of the possessed body; 
since they occupy those bodies in respect of the limits of their corporeal 
quantity, but not in respect of the limits of their essence, either of the 
body or of the soul. Observe a distinction between substance and quantity, 
or accident. But this is impertinent.
        For now we must say in what manner they see and hear. Now sight is 
of two kinds, spiritual and corporeal, and the former infinitely excels the 
latter; for it can penetrate, and is not hindered by distance, owing to the 
faculty of light of which it makes use. Therefore it must be said that in no 
way does an Angel, either good or bad, see with the eyes of its assumed 
body, nor does it use any bodily property as it does in speaking, when it 
uses the air and the vibration of the air to produce sound which becomes 
reproduced in the ears of the hearer. Wherefore their eyes are painted eyes. 
And they freely appear to men in these likenesses that they may manifest to 
them their natural properties and converse with them spiritually by these 
means.
        For with this purpose the holy Angels have often appeared to the 
Fathers at the command of God and with His permission. And the bad angels 
manifest themselves to wicked men in order that men, recognizing their 
qualities, may associate themselves with them, here in sin, and elsewhere in 
punishment.
        S. Dionysius, at the end of his Celestial Hierarchy, says: In all 
parts of the human body the Angel teaches us to consider their properties: 
concluding that since corporeal vision is an operation of the living body 
through a bodily organ, which devils lack, therefore in their assumed 
bodies, just as they have the likeness of limbs, so that have the likeness 
of their functions.
        And we can speak in the same way of their hearing, which is far 
finer than that of the body; for it can know the concept of the mind and the 
conversation of the soul more subtly than can a man by hearing the mental 
concept through the medium of spoken words. See S. Thomas, the Second Book 
of Sentences, dist. 8. For if the secret wishes of a man are read in his 
face, and physicians can tell the thoughts of the heart from the heart-beats 
and the state of the pulse, all the more can such things be known by devils.
        And we may say as to eating, that in the complete act of eating 
there are four processes. Mastication in the mouth, swallowing into the 
stomach, digestion in the stomach, and fourthly, metabolism of the necessary 
nutriment and ejection of what is superflous. All Angels can perform the 
first two processes fo eating in their assumed bodies, but not the third and 
fourth; but instead of digesting and ejecting they have another power by 
which the food is suddenly dissolved in the surrounding matter. In Christ 
the process of eating was in all respects complete, since He had the 
nutritive and metabolistic powers; not, be it said, for the purpose of 
converting food into His own body, for those power were, like His body, 
glorified; so that the food was suddenly dissolved in His body, as when one 
throws water on to fire. 

How in Modern Time Witches perform the Carnal Act with Incubus Devils,
and how they are Multiplied by this Means. 

        But no difficulty arises out of what has been said, with regard to 
our principal subject, which is the carnal act which Incubi in an assumed 
body perform with witches: unless perhaps anyone doubts whether modern 
witches practise such abominable coitus; and whether witches had their 
origin in this abomination.
        In answering these two doubts we shall say, as to the former of 
them, something of the activities of the witches who lived in olden times, 
about 1400 years before the Incarnation of Our Lord. It is, for example, 
unknown whether they were addicted to these filthy practises as modern 
witches have been since that time; for so far as we know history tells us 
nothing on this subject. But no one who reads the histories can doubt that 
there have always been witches, and that by their evil works much harm has 
been done to men, animals, and the fruits of the earth, and that Incubus and 
Succubus devils have always existed; for the traditions of the Canons and 
the holy Doctors have left and handed down to posterity many things 
concerning them through many hundreds of years. Yet there is this 
difference, that in times long past the Incubus devils used to infest women 
against their wills, as is often shown by Nider in his Formicarius, and by 
Thomas of Brabant in his book on the Universal Good, or on Bees.
        But the theory that modern witches are tainted with this sort of 
diabolic filthiness is not substantiated only in our opinion, since the 
expert testimony of the witches themselves has made all these things 
credible; and that they do not now, as in times past, subject themselves 
unwillingly, but willingly embrace this most foul and miserable servitude. 
For how many women have be left to be punished by secular law in various 
dioceses, especially in Constance and the town of Ratisbon, who have been 
for many years addicted to these abominations, some from their twentieth and 
some from their twelfth or thirteenth year, and always with a total or 
partial abnegation of the Faith? All the inhabitants of those places are 
witnesses of it. For without reckoning those who secretly repented, and 
those who returned to the Faith, no less than forty-eight have been burned 
in five years. And there was no question of credulity in accepting their 
stories because they turned to free repentance; for they all agreed in this, 
namely, that there were bound to indulge in these lewd practices in order 
that the ranks of their perfidy might be increased. But we shall treat of 
these individually in the Second Part of this work, where their particular 
deeds are described; omitting those which came under the notice of our 
colleague the Inquisitor of Como in the County of Burbia, who in the space 
of one year, which was the year of grace 1485, caused forty-one witches to 
be burned; who all publicly affirmed, as it is said, that they had practised 
these abominations with devils. Therefore this matter is fully substantiated 
by eye-witnesses, by hearsay, and the testimony of credible witnesses.
        As for the second doubt, whether witches had their origin from these 
abominations, we may say with S. Augustine that it is true that all the 
superstitious arts had their origin in a pestilent association of men with 
devils. For he says so in his work On the Christian Doctrine: All this sort 
of practices, whether of trifling or of noxious superstition, arose from 
some pestilent association of men with devils, as though some pact of 
infidel and guileful friendship had been formed, and they are all utterly to 
be repudiated. Notice here that it is manifest that, as there are various 
kinds of superstition or magic arts, and various societies of those who 
practise them; and as among the fourteen kinds of that art the species of 
witches is the worst, since they have not a tacit but an overt and expressed 
pact with the devil, and more than this, have to acknowledge a form of 
devil-worship through abjuring the Faith; therefore it follows that witches 
hold the worst kind of association with devils, with especial reference to 
the behaviour of women, who always delight in vain things. 

        Notice also S. Thomas, the Second Book of Sentences (dist. 4, art. 
4), in the solution of an argument, where he asks whether those begotten in 
this way by devils are more powerful than other men. He answers that this is 
the truth, basing his belief not only on the text of Scripture in Genesis 
vi: And the same became the mighty men which were of old; but also on the 
following reason. Devils know how to ascertain the virtue in semen: first, 
by the temperament of him from whom the semen is obtained; secondly, by 
knowing what woman is most fitted for the reception of that semen; thirdly, 
by knowing what constellation is favourable to that corporeal effect; and we 
may add, fourthly, from their own words we learn that those whom they beget 
have the best sort of disposition for devil's work. When all these causes so 
concur, it is concluded that men born in this way are powerful and big in 
body.
        Therefore, in return to the question whether witches had their 
origin in these abominations, we shall say that they originated from some 
pestilent mutual association with devils, as is clear from our first 
knowledge of them. But no one can affirm with certainty that they did not 
increase and multiply by means of these foul practices, although devils 
commit this deed for the sake not of pleasure but of corruption. And this 
appears to be the order of the process. A Succubus devil draws the semen 
from a wicked man; and if he is that man's own particular devil, and does 
not wish to make himself an Incubus to a witch, he passes that semen on to 
the devil deputed to a woman or witch; and this last, under some 
constellation that favours his purpose that the man or woman so born should 
be strong in the practice of witchcraft, becomes the Incubus to the witch.
        And it is no objection that those of whom the text speaks were not 
witches but only giants and famous and powerful men; for, as was said 
before, witchcraft was not perpetuated in the time of the law of Nature, 
because of the recent memory of the Creation of the world, which left no 
room for Idolatry. But when the wickedness of man began to increase, the 
devil found more opportunity to disseminate this kind of perfidy. 
Nevertheless, it is not to be understood that those who were said to be 
famous men were necessarily so called by reason of their good virtues. 

Whether the Relations of an Incubus Devil with a Witch are always 
accompanied by the Injection of Semen. 

        To this question it is answered that the devil has a thousand ways 
and means of inflicting injury, and from the time of his first Fall has 
tried to destroy the unity of the Church, and in every way to subvert the 
human race. Therefore no infallible rule can be stated as to this matter, 
but there is this probable distinction: that a witch is either old and 
sterile, or she is not. And if she is, then he naturally associates with the 
witch without the injection of semen, since it would be of no use, and the 
devil avoids superfluity in his operations as far as he can. But if she is 
not sterile, he approaches her in the way of carnal delectation which is 
procured for the witch. And should be disposed to pregnancy, then if he can 
conveniently possess the semen extracted from some man, he does not delay to 
approach her with it for the sake of infecting her progeny.
        But it is asked whether he is able to collect the semen emitted in 
some nocturnal pollution in sleep, just as he collects that which is spent 
in the carnal act, the answer is that it is probably that he cannot, though 
others hold a contrary opinion. For it must be noted that, as has been said, 
the devils pay attention to the generative virtue of the semen, and such 
virtue is more abundant and better preserved in semen obtained by the carnal 
act, being wasted in the semen that is due to nocturnal pollutions in sleep, 
which arises only from the superfluity of the humours and is not emitted 
with so great generative virtue. Therefore it is believed that he does not 
make use of such semen for the generation of progeny, unless perhaps he 
knows that the necessary virtue is present in that semen.
        But this also cannot altogether be denied, that even in the case of 
a married witch who has been impregnated by her husband, the devil can, by 
the commixture of another semen, infect that which has been conceived. 

Whether the Incubus operates more at one Time than another: and similarly of 
the Place. 

        To the question whether the devil observes times and places it is to 
be said that, apart from his observation of certain times and constellations 
when his purpose is to effect the pollution of the progeny, he also observes 
certain times when his object is not pollution, but the causing of venereal 
pleasure on the part of the witch; and these are the most sacred times of 
the whole year, such as Christmas, Easter, Pentacost, and other Feast days.
        And the devils do this for three reasons. First, that in this way 
witches may become imbued not only with the vice of perfidy through apostasy 
from the Faith, but also with that of Sacrilege, and that the greater 
offence may be done to the Creator, and the heavier damnation rest upon the 
souls of the witches.
        The second reason is that when God is so heavily offended, He allows 
them greater power of injuring even innocent men by punishing them either in 
their affairs or their bodies. For when it is said: “The son shall not bear 
the iniquity of the father,” etc., this refers only to eternal punishment, 
for very often the innocent are punished with temporal afflictions on 
account of the sins of others. Wherefore in another place God says: “I am a 
mighty and jealous God, visiting the sins of the fathers unto the third and 
fourth generation.” Such punishment was exemplified in the children of the 
men of Sodom, who were destroyed for their fathers' sins.
        The third reason is that they have greater opportunity to observe 
many people, especially young girls, who on Feast Days are more intent on 
idleness and curiosity, and are therefore more easily seduced by old 
witches. And the following happened in the native country of one of us 
Inquisitors (for there are two of us collaborating in this work).
        A certain young girl, a devout virgin, was solicited one Feast Day 
by an old woman to go with her upstairs to a room where there were some very 
beautiful young men. And when she consented, and as they were going upstairs 
with the old woman leading the way, she warned the girl not to make the sign 
of the Cross. And though she agreed to this, yet she secretly crossed 
herself. Consequently it happened that, when they had gone up, the virgin 
saw no one, because the devils who were there were unable to show themselves 
in assumed bodies to that virgin. And the old woman cursed her, saying: 
Depart in the name of all the devils; why did you cross yourself? This I had 
from the frank relation of that good and honest maiden.
        A fourth reason can be added, namely, that they can in this way more 
easily seduce men, by causing them to think that if God permits such things 
to be done at the most holy times, it cannot be such a heavy sin as if He 
did not permit them at such times.
        With regard to the question whether the favour one place more than 
another, it is to be said that it is proved by the words and actions of 
witches that they are quite unable to commit these abominations in sacred 
places. And in this can be seen the efficacy of the Guardian Angels, that 
such places are reverenced. And further, witches assert that they never have 
any peace except at the time of Divine Service when they are present in the 
church; and therefore they are the first to enter and the last to leave the 
church. Nevertheless, they are bound to observe certain other abominable 
ceremonies at the command of the devils, such as to spit on the ground at 
the Elevation of the Host, or to utter, either verbally or otherwise, the 
filthiest thoughts, as: I wish you were in such or such a place. This matter 
is touched upon in the Second Part. 

Whether Incubi and Succubi Commit this Act Visibly on the part of the Witch, 
or on the part of Bystanders. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----
        As to whether they commit these abominations together visibly or 
invisibly, it is to be said that, in all the cases of which we have had 
knowledge, the devil has always operated in a form visible to the witch; for 
there is no need for him to approach her invisibly, because of the pact of 
federation with him that has been expressed. But with regard to any 
bystanders, the witches themselves have often been seen lying on their backs 
in the fields or the woods, naked up to the very navel, and it has been 
apparent from the disposition of those limbs and members which pertain to 
the venereal act and orgasm, as also from the agitation of their legs and 
thighs, that, all invisibly to the bystanders, they have been copulating 
with Incubus devils; yet sometimes, howbeit this is rare, at the end of the 
act a very black vapour, of about the stature of a man, rises up into the 
air from the witch. And the reason is that that Schemer knows that he can in 
this way seduce or pervert the minds of girls or other men who are standing 
by. But of these matters, and how they have been performed in many places, 
in the town of Ratisbon, and on the estate of the nobles of Rappolstein, and 
in certain other countries, we will treat in the Second Part.
        It is certain also that the following has happened. Husbands have 
actually seen Incubus devils swiving their wives, although they have thought 
that they were not devils but men. And when they have taken up a weapon and 
tried to run them through, the devil has suddenly disappeared, making 
himself invisible. And then their wives have thrown their arms around them, 
although they have sometimes been hurt, and railed at their husbands, 
mocking them, and asking them if they had eyes, or whether they were 
possessed of devils. 

That Incubus Devils do not Infest only those Women who have been Begotten by 
their Filthy Deeds or those who have been Offered to them by Midwives, but 
All Indifferently with Greater or Less Venereal Delectation. 

        In conclusion, finally, it can be said that these Incubus devils 
will not only infest those women who have been generated by means of such 
abominations, or those who have been offered to them by midwives, but that 
they try with all their might, by means of witches who are bawds or hot 
whores, to seduce all the devout and chaste maidens in that whole district 
or town. For this is well known by the constant experience of Magistrates; 
and in the town of Ratisbon, when certain witches were burned, these 
wretches affirmed, before their final sentence, that they had been commanded 
by their Masters to use ever endeavour to effect the subversion of pious 
maids and widows.
        If it be asked: Whether the venereal delectation is greater or less 
with the Incubus devils in assumed bodies than it is in like circumstances 
with men in a true physical body, we may say this: It seems that, although 
the pleasure should naturally be greater when like disports with like, yet 
that cunning Enemy can so bring together the active and passive elements, 
not indeed naturally, but in such qualities of warmth and temperament, that 
he seems to excite no less degree of concupiscence. But this matter will be 
discussed more fully later with reference to the qualities of the feminine 
sex. 




Chapter V  Witches commonly perform their Spells through the Sacraments of 
the Church. And how they Impair the Powers of Generation, and how they may 
Cause other Ills to happen to God's Creatures of all kinds. But herein we 
except the Question of the Influence of the Stars.  

        But now there are several things to be noted concerning their 
methods of bringing injury upon other creatures of both sexes, and upon the 
fruits of the earth: first with regard to men, then with regard to beasts, 
and thirdly with regard to the fruits of the earth. And as to men, first, 
how they can cast an obstructive spell on the procreant forces, and even on 
the venereal act, so that a woman cannot conceive, or a man cannot perform 
the act. Secondly, how that act is obstructed sometimes with regard to one 
woman but not another. Thirdly, how they take away the virile member as 
though it were altogether torn away from the body. Fourthly, if it is 
possible to distinguish whether any of the above injuries have been caused 
by a devil on his own account, or if it has been through the agency of a 
witch. Fifthly, how witches change men and women into beasts by some 
prestige or glamour. Sixthly, how witch midwives in various ways kill that 
which has been conceived in the mother's womb; and when they do not do this, 
offer the children to devils. And lest these things should seem incredible, 
they have been proved in the First Part of this work by questions and 
answers to arguments; to which, if necessary, the doubtful reader may turn 
back for the purpose of investigating the truth.
        For the present our object is only to adduce actual facts and 
examples which have been found by us, or have been written by others in 
detestation of so great a crime, to substantiate those former arguments in 
case they should be difficult for anyone to understand; and, by those things 
that are related in this Second Part, to bring back to the Faith and away 
from their error those who think there are no witches, and that no 
witchcraft can be done in the world.
        And with regard to the first class of injuries with which they 
afflict the human race, it is to be noted that, apart from the methods by 
which they injure other creatures, they have six ways of injuring humanity. 
And one is, to induce an evil love in a man for a woman, or in a woman for a 
man. The second is to plant hatred or jealousy in anyone. The third is to 
bewitch them so that a man cannot perform the genital act with a woman, or 
conversely a woman with a man; or by various means to procure an abortion, 
as has been said before. The fourth is to cause some disease in any of the 
human organs. The fifth, to take away life. The sixth, to deprive them of 
reason.
        In this connexion it should be said that, saving the influence of 
the stars, the devils can by their natural power in every way cause real 
defects and infirmities, and this by their natural spiritual power, which is 
superior to any bodily power. For no one infirmity is quite like another, 
and this is equally true of natural defects in which there is no physical 
infirmity. Therefore they proceed by different methods to cause each 
different infirmity or defect. And of those we shall give instances in the 
body of this work as the necessity arises.
        But first, lest the reader's mind should be kept in any doubt as to 
why they have no power to alter the influence of the stars, we shall say 
that there is a threefold reason. First, the stars are above them even in 
the region of punishment, which is the region of the lower mists; and this 
by reason of the duty which is assigned to them. See the First Part, 
Question II, where we dealt with Incubus and Succubus devils.
        The second reason is that the stars are governed by the good Angels. 
See many places concerning the Powers which move the stars, and especially 
S. Thomas, part I, quest. 90. And in this matter the Philosophers agree with 
the Theologians.
        Thirdly, it is on account of the general order and common good of 
the Universe. which would suffer general detriment if evil spirits were 
allowed to cause any alteration in the influence of the stars. Wherefore 
those changes which were miraculously caused in the Old or New Testament 
were done by God through the good Angels; as, for example, when the sun 
stood still for Joshua, or when it went backward for Hezekiah, or when it 
was supernaturally darkened at the Passion of Christ. But in all other 
matters, with God's permission, they can work their spells, either the 
devils themselves, or devils through the agency of witches; and, in fact, it 
is evident that they do so.
        Secondly, it is to be noted that in all their methods of working 
injury they nearly always instruct witches to make their instruments of 
witchcraft by means of the Sacraments or sacramental things of the Church, 
or some holy thing consecrated to God: as when they sometimes place a waxen 
image under the Altar-cloth, or draw a thread through the Holy Chrism, or 
use some other consecrated thing in such a way. And there are three reasons 
for this.
        For a similar reason they are wont to practise their witchcraft at 
the more sacred time of the year, especially at the Advent of Our Lord, and 
at Christmas. First, that by such means they may make men guilty of not only 
perfidy, but also sacrilege, by contaminating whatever is divine in them; 
and that so they may the more deeply offend God their Creator, damn their 
own souls, and cause many more to rush into sin.
        Secondly, that God, being so heavily offended by men, may grant the 
devil greater power of tormenting them. For so says S. Gregory, that in His 
anger He sometimes grants the wicked their prayers and petitions, which He 
mercifully denies to others. And the third reason is that, by the seeming 
appearance of good, he may more easily deceive certain simple men, who think 
that they have performed some pious act and obtained the grace from God, 
whereas they have only sinned the more heavily.
        A fourth reason also can be added touching the more sacred seasons 
and the New Year. For, according to S. Augustine, there are other mortal 
sins besides adultery by which the observance of the Festivals may be 
infringed. Superstition, moreover, and witchcraft arising from the most 
servile operations of the devil are contrary to the reverence that is due to 
God. Therefore, as has been said, he causes a man to fall more deeply, and 
the Creator is the more offended.
        And of the New Year we may say, according to S. Isidore, Etym. VIII. 
2, that Janus, from whom the month of January is named, which also begins on 
the Day of Circumcision, was an idol with two faces, as if one were the end 
of the old year and the other the beginning of the new, and, as it were, the 
protector and auspicious author of the coming year. And in honour of him, or 
rather of the devil in the form of that idol, the Pagans made much 
boisterous revelry, and were very merry among themselves, holding various 
dances and feasts. And concerning these Blessed Augustine makes mention in 
many places, and gives a very ample description of them in his Twenty-sixth 
Book.
        And now bad Christians imitate these corruptions, turning them to 
lasciviousness when the run about at the time of Carnival with masks and 
jests and other superstitions. Similarly witches use these revelries of the 
devil for their own advantage, and work their spells about the time of the 
New Year in respect of the Divine Offices and Worship; as on S. Andrew's Day 
and at Christmas.
        And now, as to how they work their witchcraft, first by means of the 
Sacraments, and then by means of sacramental objects, we will refer to a few 
known facts, discovered by us in the Inquisition.
        In a town which it is better not to names, for the sake of charity 
and expediency, when a certain witch received the Body of Our Lord, she 
suddenly lowered her head, as is the detestable habit of women, placed her 
garment near her mouth, and taking the Body of the Lord out of her mouth, 
wrapped it in a handkerchief; and afterwards, at the suggestion of the 
devil, placed it in a pot in which there was a toad, and hid it in the 
ground near her house by the storehouse, together with several other things, 
by means of which she had to work her witchcraft. But with the help of God's 
mercy this great crime was detected and brought to light. For on the 
following day a workman was going on his business near that house, and heard 
a sound like a child crying; and when he had come near to the stone under 
which the pot had been hidden, he heard it much more clearly, and thinking 
that some child have been buried there by the woman, went to the Mayor or 
chief magistrate, and told him what had been done, as he thought, by the 
infanticide. And the Mayor quickly send his servants and found it to be as 
he had said. But they were unwilling to exhume the child, thinking it wiser 
to place a watch and wait to see if any woman came near the place; for they 
did not know that it was the Lord's Body that was hidden there. And so it 
happened that the same witch came to the place, and secretly hid to pot 
under her garment before their eyes. And when she was taken and questioned, 
she discovered her crime, saying that the Lord's Body had been hidden in the 
pot with a toad, so that by means of their dust she might be able to cause 
injuries at her will to men and other creatures.
        It is also to be noted that when witches communicate they observe 
this custom, that, when they can do so without being noticed, they receive 
the Lord's Body under their tongue instead of on the top. And as far as can 
be seen, the reason is that they never wish to receive any remedy that might 
counteract their abjuration of the Faith, either by Confession or by 
receiving the Sacrament of the Eucharist; and secondly, because in this way 
it is easier for them to take the Lord's Body out of their mouths so that 
they can apply it, as has been said, to their own uses, to the greater 
offence of the Creator.
        For this reason all rectors of the Church and those who communicate 
the people are enjoined to take the utmost care when they communicate women 
that the mouth shall be well open and the tongue thrust well out, and their 
garments be kept quite clear. And the more care is taken in this respect, 
the more witches become known by this means.
        Numberless other superstitions they practise by means of sacramental 
objects. Sometimes they place a waxen image or some aromatic substance under 
the altar cloth, as we said before, and then hide it under the threshold of 
a house, so that the person for whom it is placed there may be bewitched on 
crossing over it. Countless instances could be brought forward, but these 
minor sorts of spells are proved by the greater. 




Chapter VI  How Witches Impede and Prevent the Power of Procreation.  

        Concerning the method by which they obstruct the procreant function 
both in men and animals, and in both sexes, the reader my consult that which 
has been written already on the question, Whether devils can through witches 
turn the minds of men to love or hatred. There, after the solutions of the 
arguments, a specific declaration is made relating to the method by which, 
with God's permission, they can obstruct the procreant function.
        But it must be noted that such obstruction is caused both 
intrinsically and extrinsically. Intrinsically they cause it in two ways. 
First, when they directly prevent the erection of the member which is 
accomodated to fructification. And this need not seem impossible, when it is 
considered that they are able to vitiate the natural use of any member. 
Secondly, when they prevent the flow of the vital essences to the members in 
which resides the motive force, closing up the seminal ducts so that it does 
not reach the generative vessels, or so that it cannot be ejaculated, or is 
fruitlessly spilled.
        Extrinsically they cause it at times by means of images, or by the 
eating of herbs; sometimes by other external means, such as cocks' 
testicles. But it must not be thought that it is by the virtue of these 
things that a man is made impotent, but by the occult power of devils' 
illusions witches by this means procure such impotence, namely, that they 
cause man to be unable to copulate, or a woman to conceive.
        And the reason for this is that God allows them more power over this 
act, by which the first sin was disseminated, than over other human actions. 
Similarly they have more power over serpents, which are the most subject to 
the influence of incantations, than over other animals. Wherefore it has 
often been found by us and other Inquisitors that they have caused this 
obstruction by means of serpents or some such things.
        For a certain wizard who had been arrested confessed that for many 
years he had by witchcraft brought sterility upon all the men and animals 
which inhabited a certain house. Moreover, Nider tells of a wizard named 
Stadlin who was taken in the diocese of Lausanne, and confessed that in a 
certain house where a man and his wife were loving, he had by his witchcraft 
successively killed in the woman's womb seven children, so that for many 
years the woman always miscarried. And that, in the same way, he had caused 
that all the pregnant cattle and animals of the house were during those 
years unable to give birth to any live issue. And when he was questioned as 
to how he had done this, and what manner of charge should be preferred 
against him, he discovered his crime, saying: I put a serpent under the 
threshold of the outer door of the house; and if this is removed, fecundity 
will be restored to the inhabitants. And it was as he said; for though the 
serpent was not found, having been reduced to dust, the whole piece of 
ground was removed, and in the same year fecundity was restored to the wife 
and to all the animals.
        Another instance occurred hardly four years ago in Reichshofen. 
There was a most notorious witch, who could at all times and by a mere touch 
bewitch women and cause an abortion. Now the wife of a certain nobleman in 
that place had become pregnant and had engaged a midwife to take care of 
her, and had been warned by the midwife not to go out of the castle, and 
above all to be careful not to hold any speech or conversation with that 
witch. After some weeks, unmindful of that warning, she went out of the 
castle to visit some women who were met together on some festive occasion; 
and when she had sat down for a little, the witch came, and, as if for the 
purpose of saluting her, placed both her hands on her stomach; and suddenly 
she felt the child moving in pain. Frightened by this, she returned home and 
told the midwife what had happened. Then the midwife exclaimed: “Alas! you 
have already lost your child.” And so it proved when her time came; for she 
gave birth, not to an entire abortion, but little by little to separate 
fragments of its head and feet and hands. And the great affliction was 
permitted by God to punish her husband, whose duty it was to bring witches 
to justice and avenge their injuries to the Creator.
        And there was in the town of Mersburg in the diocese of Constance a 
certain young man who was bewitched in such a way that he could never 
perform the carnal act with any woman except one. And many have heard him 
tell that he had often wished to refuse that woman, and take flight to other 
lands; but that hitherto he had been compelled to rise up in the night and 
to come very quickly back, sometimes over land, and sometimes through the 
air as if he were flying. 




Chapter VII  How, as it were, they Deprive Man of his Virile Member.  

        We have already shown that they can take away the male organ, not 
indeed by actually despoiling the human body of it, in the manner which we 
have already declared. And of this we shall instance a few examples.
        In the town of Ratisbon a certain young man who had an intrigue with 
a girl, wishing to leave her, lost his member; that is to say, some glamour 
was cast over it so that he could see or touch nothing but his smooth body. 
In his worry over this he went to a tavern to drink wine; and after he had 
sat there for a while he got into conversation with another woman who was 
there, and told her the cause of his sadness, explaining everything, and 
demonstrating in his body that it was so. The woman was astute, and asked 
whether he suspected anyone; and when he named such a one, unfolding the 
whole matter, she said: “If persuasion is not enough, you must use some 
violence, to induce her to restore to you your health.” So in the evening 
the young man watched the way by which the witch was in the habit of going, 
and finding her, prayed her to restore to him the health of his body. And 
when she maintained that she was innocent and knew nothing about it, he fell 
upon her, and winding a towel tightly about her neck, choked her, saying: 
“Unless you give me back my health, you shall die at my hands.” Then she, 
being unable to cry out, and growing black, said: “Let me go, and I will 
heal you.” The young man then relaxed the pressure of the towel, and the 
witch touched him with her hand between the thighs, saying: “Now you have 
what you desire.” And the young man, as he afterwards said, plainly felt, 
before he had verified it by looking or touching, that his member had been 
restored to him by the mere touch of the witch.
        A similar experience is narrated by a certain venerable Father from 
the Dominican House of Spires, well known in the Order for the honest of his 
life and for his learning. “One day,” he says, “while I was hearing 
confessions, a young man came to me and, in the course of his confession, 
woefully said that he had lost his member. Being astonished at this, and not 
being willing to give it easy credence, since the opinion of the wise it is 
a mark of light-heartedness to believe too easily, I obtained proof of it 
when I saw nothing on the young man's removing his clothes and showing the 
place. Then, using the wisest counsel I could, I asked whether he suspected 
anyone of having so bewitched him. And the young man said that he did 
suspect someone, but that she was absent and living in Worms. Then I said: 
‘I advise you to go to her as soon as possible and try your utmost to soften 
her with gentle words and promises’; and he did so. For he came back after a 
few days and thanked me, saying that he was whole and had recovered 
everything. And I believed his words, but again proved them by the evidence 
of my eyes.”
        But there are some points to be noted for the clearer understanding 
of what has already been written concerning this matter. First, it must in 
no way be believed that such members are really torn right away from the 
body, but that they are hidden by the devil through some prestidigitory art 
so that they can be neither seen nor felt. And this is proved by the 
authorities and by argument; although is has been treated of before, where 
Alexander of Hales says that a Prestige, properly understood, is an illusion 
of the devil, which is not caused by any material change, but exists only in 
the perceptions of him who is deluded, either in his interior or exterior 
senses.
        With reference to these words it is to be noted that, in the case we 
are considering, two of the exterior senses, namely, those of sight and 
touch, are deluded, and not the interior senses, namely, common-sense, 
fancy, imagination, thought, and memory. (But S. Thomas says they are only 
four, as has been told before, reckoning fancy and imagination as one; and 
with some reason, for there is little difference between imagining and 
fancying. See S. Thomas, I, 79.) And these senses, and not only the exterior 
senses, are affected when it is not a case of hiding something, but the 
causing something to appear to a man either when he is aware or asleep.
        As when a man who is awake sees things otherwise than as they are; 
such as seeing someone devour a horse with its rider, or thinking he sees a 
man transformed into a beast, or thinking that he is himself a beast and 
must associate with beasts. For then the exterior senses are deluded and are 
employed by the interior senses. For by the power of devils, with God's 
permission, mental images long retained in the treasury of such images, 
which is the memory, are drawn out, not from the intellectual understanding 
in which such images are stored, but from the memory, which is the 
repository of mental images, and is situated at the back of the head, and 
are presented to the imaginative faculty. And so strongly are they impressed 
on that faculty that a man has an inevitable impulse to imagine a horse or a 
beast, when the devil draws from the memory an image of a horse or a beast; 
and so he is compelled to think that he sees with his external eyes such a 
beast when there is actually no such beast to see; but it seems to be so by 
reason of the impulsive force of the devil working by means of those images.
        And it need not seem wonderful that devils can do this, when even a 
natural defect is able to effect the same result, as is shown in the case of 
frantic and melancholy men, and in maniacs and some drunkards, who are 
unable to discern truly. For frantic men think they see marvellous things, 
such as beasts and other horrors, when in actual fact they see nothing. See 
above, in the question, Whether witches can turn the minds of men to love 
and hatred; where many thing are noted.
        And, finally, the reason is self-evident. For since the devil has 
power over inferior things, except only the soul, therefore he is able to 
effect certain changes in those things, when God allows, so that things 
appear to be otherwise than they are. And this he does, as I have said, 
either by confusing and deluding the organ of sight so that a clear thing 
appears cloudy; just as after weeping, owing to the collected humours, the 
light appears to different from what it was before. Or by operating on the 
imaginative faculty by a transmutation of mental images, as has been said. 
Or by some agitation of various humours, so that matters which are earthy 
and dry seem to be fire or water: as some people make everyone in the house 
strip themselves naked under the impression that they are swimming in water.
        It may be asked further with reference to the above method of 
devils, whether this sort of illusions can happen indifferently to the good 
and to the wicked: just as other bodily infirmities can, as will be shown 
later, be brought by witches even upon those who are in a state of grace. To 
this question, following the words of Cassian in his Second Collation of the 
Abbot Sirenus, we must answer that they cannot. And from this it follows 
that all who are deluded in this way are presumed to be in deadly sin. For 
he says, as is clear from the words of S. Antony: The devil can in no way 
enter the mind or body of any man, nor has the power to penetrate into the 
thoughts of anybody, unless such a person has first become destitute of all 
holy thoughts, and is quite bereft and denuded of spiritual contemplation.
        This agrees with Boethius where he says in the Consolation of 
Philosophy: We had given you such arms that, if you had not thrown them 
away, you would have been preserved from infirmity.
        Also Cassian tells in the same place of two Pagan witches, each in 
his own way malicious, who by their witchcraft sent a succession of devils 
into the cell of S. Antony for the purpose of driving him from there by 
their temptations; being infected with hatred for the holy man because a 
great number of people visited him every day. And though these devils 
assailed him with the keenest of spurs to his thoughts, yet he drove them 
away by crossing himself on the forehead and breast, and by prostrating 
himself in earnest prayer.
        Therefore we may say that all who are so deluded by devils, not 
reckoning any other bodily infirmities, are lacking in the gift of divine 
grace. And so it is said in Tobias vi: The devil has power against those who 
are subject to their lusts.
        This is also substantiated by what we told in the First Part in the 
question, Whether witches can change men into the shapes of beasts. For we 
told of a girl who was turned into a filly, as she herself and, except S. 
Macharius, all who looked at her were persuaded. But the devil could not 
deceive the senses of the holy man; and when she was brought to him to be 
healed, he saw true woman and not a horse, while on the other hand everyone 
else exclaimed that she seemed to be a horse. And the Saint, by his prayers, 
freed her and the others from that illusion, saying that this had happened 
to her because she had not attended sufficiently to holy things, nor used as 
she should Holy Confession and the Eucharist. And for this reason, because 
in her honesty she would not consent to the shameful proposal of a young 
man, who had caused a Jew who was a witch to bewitch the girl so that, by 
the power of the devil, he turned her into a filly.
        We may summarize our conclusions as follows: - Devils can, for their 
profit and probation, injure the good in their fortunes, that is, in such 
exterior things as riches, fame, and bodily health. This is clear from the 
case of the Blessed Job, who was afflicted by the devil in such matters. But 
such injuries are not of their own causing, so that they cannot be led or 
driven into any sin, although they can be tempted both inwardly and 
outwardly in the flesh. But the devils cannot afflict the good with this 
sort of illusions, either actively or passively.
        Not actively, but deluding their senses as they do those of others 
who are not in a state of grace. And not passively, by taking away their 
male organs by some glamour. For in these two respects they could never 
injure Job, especially in regard to the venereal act; for he was of such 
continence that he was able to say: I have vowed a vow with my eyes that I 
shall never think about a virgin, and still less about another man's wife. 
Nevertheless the devil knows that he has great power over sinners (see S. 
Luke xi: When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in 
peace).
        But it may be asked, as to illusions in respect of the male organ, 
whether, granted that the devil cannot impose this illusion on those in a 
state of grace in a passive way, he cannot still do so in an active sense: 
the argument being that the man in a state of grace is deluded because he 
ought to see the member in its right place, when he who thinks it has been 
taken away from him, as well as other bystanders, does not see in in its 
place; but if this is conceded, it seems to be contrary to what has been 
said. It can be said that there is not so much force in the active as in the 
passive loss; meaning by active loss, not his who bears the loss, but his 
who sees the loss from without, as is self-evident. Therefore, although a 
man in a state of grace can se the loss of another, and to that extent the 
devil can delude his senses; yet he cannot passively suffer such loss in his 
own body, as, for example, to be deprived of his member, since he is not 
subject to list. In the same way the converse is true, as the Angel said to 
Tobias: Those who are given to lust, the devil has power over them.
        And what, then, is to be thought of those witches who in this way 
sometimes collect male organs in great numbers, as many as twenty or thirty 
members together, and put them in a bird's nest, or shut them up in a box, 
where they move themselves like living members, and eat oats and corn, as 
has been seen by many and is a matter of common report? It is to be said 
that it is all done by devil's work and illusion, for the senses of those 
who see them are deluded in the way we have said. For a certain man tells 
that, when he had lost his member, he approached a known witch to ask her to 
restore it to him. She told the afflicted man to climb a certain tree, and 
that he might take which he liked out of the nest in which there were 
several members. And when he tried to take a big one, the witch said: You 
must not take that one; adding, because it belongs to a parish priest.
        All these things are caused by devils through an illusion or 
glamour, in the manner we have said, by confusing the organ of vision by 
transmuting the mental images in the imaginative faculty. And it must not be 
said that these members which are shown are devils in assumed members, just 
as they sometimes appear to witches and men in assumed aerial bodies, and 
converse with them. And the reason is that they effect this thing by an 
easier method, namely, by drawing out an inner mental image from the 
repository of the memory, and impressing it on the imagination.
        And if anyone wishes to say that they could go to work in a similar 
way, when they are said to converse with witches and other men in assumed 
bodies; that is, that they could cause such apparitions by changing the 
mental images in the imaginative faculty, so that when men thought the 
devils were present in assumed bodies, they were really nothing but an 
illusions caused by such a change of the mental images in the inner 
perceptions.
        It is to be said that, if the devil had no other purpose than merely 
to show himself in human form, then there would be no need for him to appear 
in an assumed body, since he could effect his purpose well enough by the 
aforesaid illusion. But this is not so; for he has another purpose, namely, 
to speak and eat with them, and to commit other abominations. Therefore it 
is necessary that he should himself be present, placing himself actually in 
sight in an assumed body. For, as S. Thomas says, Where the Angel's power 
is, there he operates.
        And it may be asked, if the devil by himself and without any witch 
takes away anyone's virile member, whether there is any difference between 
one sort of deprivation and the other. In addition to what has been said in 
the First Part of this work on the question, Whether witches can take away a 
member, he does actually take it away, and it is actually restored when it 
has to be restored. Secondly, as it is not taken away without injury, so it 
is not without pain. Thirdly, that he never does this unless compelled by a 
good Angel, for by so doing he cuts off a great source of profit to him; for 
he knows that he can work more witchcraft on that act than on other human 
acts. For God permits him to do more injury to that than to other human 
acts, as has been said. But none of the above points apply when he works 
through the agency of a witch, with God's permission.
        And if it is asked whether the devil is more apt to injure men and 
creatures by himself than through a witch, it can be said that there is no 
comparison between the two cases. For he is infinitely more apt to do harm 
through the agency of witches. First, because he thus gives greater offence 
to God, by usurping to himself a creature dedicated to Him. Secondly, 
because when God is the more offended, He allows him the more power of 
injuring men. And thirdly, for his own gains, which he places in the 
perdition of souls. 




Chapter VIII  Of the Manner whereby they Change Men into the Shapes of 
Beasts 

        But that witches, by the power of devils, change men into the shapes 
of beasts (for this is their chief manner of transmutation), although it has 
been sufficiently proved in the First Part of the work, Question 10, Whether 
witches can do such things: nevertheless, since that question with its 
arguments and solutions may be rather obscure to some; especially since no 
actual examples are adduced to prove them, and even the method by which they 
so transform themselves is not explained; therefore we add the present 
exposition by the resolution of several doubts.
        And first, that Canon (26, Q. 5, Episcopi) is not to be understood 
in this matter in the way in which even many learned men (but would that 
their learning were good!) are deceived; who do not fear to affirm publicly 
in their sermons that such prestidigitatory transmutations are in no way 
possible even by the power of devils. And we have often said that this 
doctrine is greatly to the detriment of the Faith, and strengthens the 
witches, who rejoice very much in such sermons.
        But such preachers, as has been noted, touch only the outer surface, 
and fail to reach the inner meaning of the words of the Canon. For when it 
says: Whoever believes that any creature can be made, or can be changed for 
the better or the worse, or be transformed into any other shape or likeness 
except by the Creator Himself Who made all, is without doubt an infidel. . . 
.
        The reader must here remark two chief things. First, concerning the 
words “be made”; and secondly, concerning the words “be transformed into 
another likeness.” And as to the first, it is answered that “be made” can be 
understood in two ways: namely, as meaning “be created,” or as in the sense 
of the natural production of anything. Now in the first sense it belongs 
only to God, as is well known, Who in His infinite might can make something 
out of nothing.
        But in the second sense there is a distinction to be drawn between 
creatures; for some are perfect creatures, like a man, and an ass, etc. And 
other are imperfect, such as serpents, frogs, mice, etc., for they can also 
be generated from putrefaction. Now the Canon obviously speaks only of the 
former sort, not of the second; for in the case of the second it can be 
proved from what Blessed Albert says in his book On Animals, where he asks: 
whether devils can make true animals; and still with this difference, that 
they cannot do so in an instant, as God does, but by some motion, however 
sudden, as is shown in the case of the Magicians in Exodus vii. The reader 
may, if he likes, refer to some of the remarks in the question we have 
quoted in the First Part of the work, and in the solution of the first 
argument.
        Secondly, it is said that they cannot transmute any creature. You 
may say that transmutation is of two sorts, substantial and accidental; and 
this accidental is again of two kinds, consisting either in the natural form 
belonging to the thing which is seen, or in a form which does not belong to 
the thing which is seen, but exists only in the organs and perceptions of 
him who sees. The Canon speaks of the former, and especially of formal and 
actual transmutation, in which one substance is transmuted into another; and 
this sort only God can effect, Who is the Creator of such actual substances. 
And it speaks also of the second, although the devil can effect that, in so 
far as, with God's permission, he causes certain diseases and induces some 
appearance on the accidental body. As when a face appears to be leprous, or 
some such thing.
        But properly speaking it is not such matters that are in question, 
but apparitions and glamours, by which things seem to be transmuted into 
other likenesses; and we say that the words of the Canon cannot exclude such 
transmutations; for their existence is proved by authority, by reason, and 
by experience; namely, by certain experiences related by S. Augustine in 
Book XVIII, chapter 17, of the De Ciuitate Die, and by the arguments in 
explanation of them. For among other prestidigitatory transformations, he 
mentions that the very famous Sorceress, Circe, changed the companions of 
Ulysses into beasts; and that certain innkeepers' wives had turned their 
guests into beasts of burden. He mentions also that the companions of 
Diomedes were changed into birds, and for a long time flew about the temple 
of Diomedes; and that Praestantius tells it for a fact that his father said 
that he had been a packhorse, and had carried corn with other animals.
        Now when the companions of Ulysses were changed into beasts, it was 
only in appearance, or deception of the eyes; for the animal shapes were 
drawn out of the repository or memory of images, and impressed on the 
imaginative faculty. And so imaginary vision was caused, and through the 
strong impression on the other senses and organs, the beholder thought that 
he saw animals, in the manner of which we have already treated. But how 
these things can be done by the devil's power without injury will be shown 
later.
        But when the guests were changed into beasts of burden by the 
innkeepers' wives; and when the father of Praestantius thought he was a 
packhorse and carried corn; it is to be noted that in these cases there were 
three deceptions.
        First, that those men were caused by a glamour to seem to be changed 
into beasts of burden, and this change was caused in the way we have said. 
Second, that devils invisibly bore those burdens up when they were too heavy 
to be carried. Third, that those who seemed to others to be changed in shape 
seemed also to themselves to be changed into beasts; as it happened to 
Nabuchodonosor, who lived for seven years eating straw like an ox.
        And as to the comrades of Diomedes being changed into birds and 
flying round his temple, it is to be said that this Diomedes was one of the 
Greeks who went to the siege of Troy; and when he wished to return home, he 
was drowned with his comrades in the sea; and then, at the suggestion of 
some idol, a temple was built to him that he might be numbered among the 
gods; and for a long time, to keep that error alive, devils in the shape of 
birds flew about in place of his companions. Therefore that superstition was 
one of the glamours we have spoken of; for it was not caused by the 
impression of mental images on the imaginative faculty, but by their flying 
in the sight of men in the assumed bodies of birds.
        But if it is asked whether the devils could have deluded the 
onlookers by the above-mentioned method of working upon the mental images, 
and not by assuming aerial bodies like flying birds, the answer is that they 
could have done so.
        For it was the opinion of some (as S. Thomas tells in the Second 
Book of Sentences, dist. 8, art. 2) that no Angel, good or bad, ever assumed 
a body; but that all that we read in the Scriptures about their appearances 
was caused by a glamour, or by the imaginary vision.
        And here the learned Saint notes a difference between a glamour and 
imaginary vision. For in a glamour there may be an exterior object which is 
seen, but it seems other than it is. But imaginary vision does not 
necessarily require an exterior object, but can be caused without that and 
only by those inner mental images impressed on the imagination.
        So, following their opinion, the comrades of Diomedes were not 
represented by devils in the assumed bodies and likeness of birds, but only 
by a fantastic and imaginary vision caused by working upon those mental 
images, etc.
        But the learned Saint condemns this as an erroneous and not a simple 
opinion (though, it is piously believed, it is not actually heretical), 
although such appearances of good and bad Angels may at times have been 
imaginary, with no assumed body. But, as he says, the saints are agreed that 
the Angels also appeared to the actual sight, and such appearance was in an 
assumed body. And the scriptural text reads more as if it speaks of bodily 
appearance than imaginary or prestidigitatory ones. Therefore we can say for 
the present concerning any visions like that of the comrades of Diomedes: 
that although those comrades could by the devil's work have appeared in the 
imaginary vision of the beholders in the manner we have said, yet it is 
rather presumed that they were caused to be seen by devils in assumed aerial 
bodies like flying birds; or else that other natural birds were caused by 
devils to represent them. 




Chapter IX  How Devils may enter the Human Body and the Head without doing 
any Hurt, when they cause such Metamorphosis by Means of Prestidigitation.  

        Concerning the method of causing these illusory transmutations it 
may further be asked: whether the devils are then inside the bodies and 
heads of those who are deceived, and whether the latter are to be considered 
as possessed by devils; how it can happen without injury to the inner 
perceptions and faculties that a mental image is transferred from one inner 
faculty to another; and whether or not such work ought to be considered 
miraculous.
        First we must again refer to a distinction between such illusory 
glamours; for sometimes the outer perceptions only are affected, and 
sometimes the inner perceptions are deluded and so affect the outer 
perceptions.
        In the former case the glamour can be caused without the devils' 
entering into the outer perceptions, and merely by an exterior illusion; as 
when the interposition of some other body, or in some other way; or when he 
himself assumes a body and imposes himself on the vision.
        But in the latter case it is necessary that he must first occupy the 
head and the faculties. And this is proved by authority and by reason.
        And it is not a valid objection to say that two created spirits 
cannot be in one and the same place, and that the soul pervades the whole of 
the body. For on this question there is the authority of S. John Damascene, 
when he says: Where the Angel is, there he operates. And S. Thomas, in the 
Second Book of Sentences, dist. 7, art. 5, says: All Angels, good and bad, 
by their natural power, which is superior to all bodily power, are able to 
transmute our bodies.
        And this is clearly true, not only by reason of the superior 
nobility of their nature, but because the whole mechanism of the world and 
all corporeal creatures are administered by Angels; as S. Gregory says in 
the 4th Dialogue: In this visible world nothing can be disposed except by an 
invisible creature. Therefore all corporeal matters are governed by the 
Angels, who are also called, not only by the Holy Doctors but also by all 
the Philosophers, the Powers which move the stars. It is clear also from the 
fact that all human bodies are moved by their souls, just as all other 
matter is moved by the stars and the Powers which move them. Any who wish 
may refer to S. Thomas in the First Part, Quest. 90, art. 1.
        From this it is concluded that, since devils operates there where 
they are, therefore when they confuse the fancy and the inner perceptions 
they are existing in them.
        Again, although to enter the soul is possible only to God Who 
created it, yet devils can, with God's permission, enter our bodies; and 
they an then make impressions on the inner faculties corresponding to the 
bodily organs. And by those impressions the organs are affected in 
proportion as the inner perceptions are affected in the way which has been 
shown: that the devil can draw out some image retained in a faculty 
corresponding to one of the senses; as he draws from the memory, which is in 
the back part of the head, an image of a horse, and locally moves that 
phantasm to the middle part of the head, where are the cells of imaginative 
power; and finally to the sense of reason, which is in the front of the 
head. And he causes such a sudden change and confusion, that such objects 
are necessarily thought to be actual things seen with the eyes. This can be 
clearly exemplified by the natural defect in frantic men and other maniacs.
        But if it is asked how he can do this without causing pain in the 
head, the answer is easy. For in the first place he does not cause any 
actual physical change in the organs, but only moves the mental images. And 
secondly, he does not effect these changes by injecting any active quality 
which would necessarily cause pain, since the devil is himself without any 
corporeal quality, and can therefore operate without the use of any such 
quality. Thirdly, as has been said, he effects these transmutations only by 
a local movement from one organ to another, and not by other movements 
through which painful transformations are sometimes caused.
        And as for the objection that two spirits cannot separately exist in 
the same place, and that, since the soul exists in the head, how can a devil 
be there also? It is to be said that the soul is thought to reside in the 
centre of the heart, in which it communicates with all the members by an 
outpouring of life. An example can be taken from a spider, which feels in 
the middle of its web when any part of the web is touched.
        However, S. Augustine says in his book On the Spirit and Soul, that 
it is all in all, and all in every part of the body. Granting that the soul 
is in the head, still the devil can work there; for his work is different 
from the work of the soul. The work of the soul is in the body, to inform it 
and fill it with life; so that it exists not merely locally, but in the 
whole matter. But the devil works in such a part and such a place of the 
body, effecting his changes in respect of the mental images. Therefore, 
since there is no confusion between their respective operations, they can 
both exist together in the same part of the body.
        There is also the question whether such men are to be considered 
obsessed or frenzied, that is, possessed of devils. But this is considered 
separately; namely, whether it is possible through the work of witches for a 
man to be obsessed with a devil, that is, that the devil should actually and 
bodily possess him. And this question is specially discussed in the 
following chapter, since it has this special difficulty, namely, whether 
this can be caused through the operations of witches.
        But as to the question whether the temporal works of witches and 
devils are to be considered as miracles or of a miraculous nature; it is to 
be said that they are so, in so far as they are beyond the order of created 
nature as known to us, and are done by creatures unknown to us. But they are 
not properly speaking miracles as are those which are outside the whole of 
created nature; as are the miracles of God and the Saints. (See what was 
written in the First Part of this work, in the Fifth Question, in the 
refutation of the third error.)
        But there are those who object that this sort of work must not be 
considered miracles, but simply works of the devil; since the purpose of 
miracles is the strengthening of the Faith, and they must not be conceded to 
the adversary of the Faith. And also because the signs of Antichrist are 
called lying signs by the Apostle.
        First it is to be said that to work miracles is the gift of freely 
given grace. And they can be done by bad men and bad spirits, up to the 
limits of the power which is in them.
        Wherefore the miracles wrought by the good can be distinguished from 
those wrought by the wicked in at least three ways. First, the signs which 
are given by the good are done by Divine power in such matters as are beyond 
the capacity of their own natural power, such as raising the dead, and 
things of that sort, which the devils are not able to accomplish in truth, 
but only by an illusion: so Simon Magus moved the head of a dead man; but 
such manifestations cannot last long. Secondly, they can be distinguished by 
their utility; for the miracles of the good are of a useful nature, as the 
healing of sickness, and such things. But the miracles done by witches are 
concerned with harmful and idle things; as when they fly in the air, or 
benumb the limbs of men, or such things. And S. Peter assigns this 
difference in the Itinerarium of Clement.
        The third difference relates to the Faith. For the miracles of the 
good are ordained for the edification of the Faith and of good living; 
whereas the miracles of the wicked are manifestly detrimental to the Faith 
and to righteousness.
        They are distinguished also by the way in which they are done. For 
the good do miracles in a pious and reverent invocation of the Divine Name. 
But witches and wicked men work them by certain ravings and invocations of 
devils.
        And there is no difficulty in the fact that the Apostle called the 
works of the devil and Antichrist lying wonders; for the marvels so done by 
Divine permission are true in some respects and false in others. They are 
true in so far as they are within the limits of the devil's power. But they 
are false when he appears to do things which are beyond his power, such as 
raising the dead, or making the blind to see. For when he appears to do the 
former, he either enters into the dead body or else removes it, and himself 
takes its place in an assumed aerial body; and in the latter case he takes 
away the sight by a glamour, and then suddenly restores it by taking away 
the disability he has caused, not by bringing light to the inner 
perceptions, as is told in the legend of Bartholomew. Indeed all the 
marvellous works of Antichrist and of witches can be said to be lying signs, 
insasmuch as their only purpose is to deceive. See S. Thomas, dist. 8, de 
Uirtute Daemonum.
        We may also quote here the distinction which is drawn in the 
Compendium of Theological Truth between a wonder and a miracle. For in a 
miracle four conditions are required: that it should be done by God; that it 
should be beyond the existing order of nature; thirdly, that it should be 
manifest; and fourthly, that it should be for the corroboration of the 
Faith. But since the works of witches fail to fulfil at least the first and 
last conditions, therefore they may be called wonderful works, but nor 
miracles.
        It can also be argued in this way. Although witches' works can in a 
sense be said to be miraculous, yet some miracles are supernatural, some 
unnatural, and some preternatural. And they are supernatural when they can 
be compared with nothing in nature, or in natural power, as when a virgin 
gives birth. They are unnatural when they are against the normal course of 
nature but do not overstep the limits of nature, such as causing the blind 
to see. And they are preternatural when they are done in a manner parallel 
to that of nature, as when rods are changed into serpents; for this can be 
done naturally also, through long putrefaction on account of seminal 
reasons; and thus the works of magicians may be said to be marvellous.
        It is expedient to recount an actual example, and then to explain it 
step by step. There is a town in the diocese of Strasburg, the name of which 
it is charitable and honourable to withhold, in which a workman was one day 
chopping some wood to burn in his house. A large cat suddenly appeared and 
began to attack him, and when he was driving it off, another even larger one 
came and attacked him with the first more fiercely. And when he again tried 
to drive them away, behold, three of them together attacked him, jumping up 
at his face, and biting and scratching his legs. In great fright and, as he 
said, more panic-stricken than he had ever been, he crossed himself and, 
leaving his work, fell upon the cats, which were swarming over the wood and 
again leaping at his face and throat, and with difficulty drove them away by 
beating one on the head, another on the legs, and another on the back. After 
the space of an hour, while he was again engaged upon his task, two servants 
of the town magistrates came and took him as a malefactor and led him into 
the presence of the bailiff or judge. And the judge, looking at him from a 
distance, and refusing to hear him, ordered him to be thrown into the 
deepest dungeon of a certain tower or prison, where those who were under 
sentence of death were placed. The man cried out, and for three days 
bitterly complained to the prison guards that he should suffer in that way, 
when he was conscious of no crime; but the more the guards tried to procure 
him a hearing, the more furious the judge became, expressing in the 
strongest terms his indignation that so great a malefactor had not yet 
acknowledged his crime, but dared to proclaim his innocence when the 
evidence of the facts proved his horrible crime. But although these could 
not prevail upon him, yet the judge was induced by the advice of the other 
magistrates to grant the man a hearing. So when he was brought out of prison 
into the presence of the judge, and the judge refused to look at him, the 
poor man threw himself before the knees of the other magistrates, pleading 
that he might know the reason for his misfortune; and the judge broke into 
these words: You most wicked of men, how can you not acknowledge your crime? 
At such a time on such a day you beat three respected matrons of this town, 
so that they lie in their beds unable to rise or to move. The poor man cast 
his mind back to the events of that day and that hour, and said: Never in 
all my life have I struck or beaten a woman, and I can prove by credible 
witnesses that at that time on that day I was busy chopping wood; and an 
hour afterwards your servants found me still engaged on that task. Then the 
judge again exclaimed in a fury: See how he tries to conceal his crime! The 
women are bewailing their blows, they exhibit the marks, and publicly 
testify that he struck them. Then the poor man considered more closely on 
that even, and said: I remember that I struck some creatures at that time, 
but they were not women. The magistrates in astonishment asked him to relate 
what sort of creatures he had struck; and he told, to their great amazement, 
all that had happened, as we have related it. So, understanding that it was 
the work of the devil, they released the poor man and let him go away 
unharmed, telling him not to speak of this matter to anyone. But it could 
not be hidden from those devout persons present who were zealous for the 
Faith. 

        Now concerning this it may be asked, whether the devils appeared 
thus in assumed shapes without the presence of the witches, or whether the 
witches were actually present, converted by some glamour into the shapes of 
those beasts. And in answering this it should be said that, although it was 
equally possible for the devils to act in either way, it is rather presumed 
that it was done in the second manner. For when the devils attacked the 
workman in the shapes of cats, they could suddenly, by local motion through 
the air, transfer the women to their houses with the blows which they 
received as cats from the workman; and no on doubts that this was because of 
a mutual pact formerly made between them. For in the same way they can cause 
injury or wound in a person whom they wish to bewitch, by means of 
puncturing a painted or molten image which represents the person whom they 
wish to injure. Many examples of this could be adduced.
        And it cannot be validly objected that perhaps those women who were 
so injured were innocent, because according to previously quoted examples it 
is shown that injuries may happen even to the innocent, when someone is 
unknowingly hurt by a witch by means of an artificial image. The example is 
not apposite; for it is one thing to be hurt by a devil through a witch, and 
another thing to be hurt by the devil himself without any witch. For the 
devil receives blows in the form of an animal, and transfers them to one who 
is bound to him by a pact, when it is with such an one's consent that he 
acts in this manner in such a shape. Therefore he can in this way hurt only 
the guilty who are bound to him by a pact, and never the innocent. But when 
devils seek to do injury by means of witches, then, with the permission of 
God for the avenging of so great a crime, they often afflict even the 
innocent.
        Nevertheless, devils at times, with God's permission, in their own 
persons hurt even the innocent; and formerly they injured the Blessed Job, 
although they were not personally present, nor did the devils make use of 
any such illusory apparition as in the example we have quoted, when they 
used the phantasm of a cat, an animal which is, in the Scriptures, an 
appropriate symbol of the perfidious, just as a dog is the symbol of 
preachers; for cats are always setting snares for each other. And the Order 
of Preaching Friars was represented in its first Founder by a dog barking 
against heresy.
        Therefore it is presumed that those three witches attacked the 
workman in the second manner, either because the first manner did not please 
them so much, or because the second suited more with their curiosity.
        And this was the order which they observed. First, they were urged 
to do this at the instance of the devils, and not the devils at the instance 
of the witches. For so we have often found in their confessions, that at the 
instance of devils who constantly spur them on to commit evil, they have to 
do more than they would. And it is likely that the witches would not, on 
their own account, have thought of attacking the poor man.
        And there is no doubt that the reason why the devils urged them to 
do this is that they knew well that, when a manifest crime remains 
unpunished, God is the more offended, the Catholic Faith is brought into 
disrepute, and the number of witches is the more increased. Secondly, having 
gained their consent, the devils transported their bodies with that ease 
which belongs to a spiritual power over a bodily power. Thirdly, having in 
the way which has been told been turned into the forms of beasts by some 
glamour, they had to attack the workman; and the devils did not defend them 
from the blows, although they could have done so just as easily as they had 
transported them; but they permitted them to be beaten, and the one who beat 
them to be known, in the knowledge that those crimes would, for the reasons 
we have mentioned, remain unpunished by faint-hearted men who had no zeal 
for the Faith.
        We read also of a certain holy man, who once found the devil 
preaching in the form of a devout priest preaching in a church, and knowing 
in his spirit that is was the devil, observed his words, whether he was 
teaching the people well or ill. And finding him irreproachable and 
inveighing against sin, he went up to him at the end of the sermon and asked 
him the reason for this. And the devil answered: I preach the truth, knowing 
that, because they are hearers of the word only, and not doers, God is the 
more offended and my gain is increased. 




Chapter X  Of the Method by which Devils through the Operations of Witches 
sometimes actually possess men.  

        It has been shown in the previous chapter how devils can enter the 
heads and other parts of the body of men, and can move the inner mental 
images from place to place. But someone may doubt whether they are able at 
the instance of witches to obsess men entirely; or fell some uncertainty 
about their various methods of causing such obsession without the instance 
of witches. And to clear up these doubts we must undertake three 
explanations. First, as to the various methods of possession. Secondly, how 
at the instance of witches and with God's permission devils at time possess 
men in all those ways. Thirdly, we must substantiate our arguments with 
facts and examples.
        With references to the first, we must make an exception of that 
general method by which the devil inhabits a man in any mortal sin. S. 
Thomas, in Book 3, quest. 3, speaks of this method where he considers the 
doubt whether the devil always substantially possesses a man when he commits 
mortal sin; and the reason for the doubt is that the indwelling Holy Ghost 
always forms a man with grace, according to I. Corinthians, iii: Ye are the 
temple of God, and the spirit of God dwelleth in you. And, since guilt is 
opposed to grace, it would seem that there were opposing forces in the same 
place.
        And there he proves that to possess a man can be understood in two 
ways: either with regard to the soul, or with regard to the body. And in the 
first way it is not possible for the devil to possess the soul, since God 
alone can enter that; therefore the devil is not in this way the cause of 
sin, which the Holy Spirit permits the soul itself to commit; so there is no 
similitude between the two.
        But as to the body, we may say that the devil can possess a man in 
two ways, just as there are two classes of men: those who are in sin, and 
those who are in grace. In the first way, we may say that, since a man is by 
any mortal sin brought into the devil's service, in so far as the devil 
provides the outer suggestion of sin either to the senses or to the 
imagination, to that extent he is said to inhabit the character of a man 
when he is moved by every stirring temptation, like a ship in the sea 
without a rudder.
        The devil can also essentially possess a man as is clear in the case 
of frantic men. But this rather belongs to the question of punishment than 
that of sin, as will be shown; and bodily punishments are not always the 
consequence of sin, but are inflicted now upon sinners and now upon the 
innocent. Therefore both those who are and those who are not in a state of 
grace can, in the depth of the incomprehensible judgement of God, be 
essentially possessed by devils. And though this method of possession is not 
quite pertinent to our inquire, we have set it down lest it should seem 
impossible to anyone that, with God's permission, men should at times be 
substantially inhabited by devils at the instance of witches.
        We may say, therefore, that just as there are five ways in which 
devils by themselves, without witches, can injure and possess men, so they 
can also do so in those ways at the instance of witches; since then God is 
the more offended, and greater power of molesting men is allowed to the 
devil through witches. And the methods are briefly the following, excepting 
the fact that they sometimes plague a man through his external possessions: 
sometimes they injure men only in their own bodies; sometimes in their and 
in their faculties; sometimes they only tempt them inwardly and outwardly; 
others they at times deprive of the use of their reason; others they change 
into the appearance of irrational beasts. We shall speak of these methods 
singly.
        But first we shall rehearse five reasons why God allows men to be 
possessed, for the sake of preserving a due order in our matter. For 
sometimes a man is possessed for his own advantage; sometimes for a slight 
sin of another; and sometimes for his own venial sin; sometimes for 
another's heavy sin. For all these reasons let no one doubt that God allows 
such things to be done by devils at the instance of witches; and it is 
better to prove each of them by the Scriptures, rather than by recent 
examples, since new things are always strengthened by old examples.
        For an example of the first is clearly shown in the Dialogue of 
Severus, a very dear disciple of S. Martin, where he tells that a certain 
Father of very holy life was so gifted by grace with the power of expelling 
devils, that they were put to flight not only by his words, but even by his 
letters or his hair-shirt. And since the Father became very famous in the 
world, and felt himself tempted with vainglory, although he manfully 
resisted that vice, yet, that he might be the more humiliated, he prayed 
with his whole heart to God that he might be for five months possessed by a 
devil; and this was done. For he was at once possessed and had to be put in 
chains, and everything had to applied to him which is customary in the case 
of demoniacs. But at the end of the fifth month he was immediately delivered 
both from all vainglory and from the devil. But we do not read, nor is it 
for the present maintained, that for this reason a man can be possessed by a 
devil through the witchcraft of another man; although, as we have said, the 
judgements of God are incomprehensible.
        For the second reason, when someone is possessed because of the 
light sin of another, S. Gregory gives an example. The Blessed Abbot 
Eleutherius, a most devout man, was spending the night near a convent of 
virgins, who unknown to him ordered to be put by his cell a young boy who 
used to be tormented all night by the devil. But on that same night the boy 
was delivered from the devil by the presence of the Father. When the Abbot 
learned of this, and the boy now being placed in the holy man's monastery, 
after many days he began to exult rather immoderately over the boy's 
liberation, and said to his brother monks: The devil was playing his pranks 
with those Sisters, but he had not presumed to approach this boy since he 
came to the servants of God. And behold! the devil at once began to torment 
the boy. And by the tears and fasting of the holy man and his brethren he 
was with difficulty delivered, but on the same day. And indeed that an 
innocent person should be possessed for the slight fault of another is not 
surprising when men are possessed by devils for their own light fault, or 
for another's heavy sin, or for their own heavy sin, and some also at the 
instance of witches.
        Cassia, in his First Collation of the Abbot Serenus, gives an 
example of how one Moses was possessed for his own venial sin. This Moses, 
he says, was a hermit of upright and pious life; but because on one occasion 
he engaged in a dispute with the Abbot Macharius, and went a little too far 
in the expression of a certain opinion, he was immediately delivered up to a 
terrible devil, who caused him to void his natural excrements through his 
mouth. And that this scourge was inflicted by God for the sake of purgation, 
lest any stain of his momentary fault should remain in him, is clear from 
his miraculous cure. For by continual prayers and submission to the Abbot 
Macharius, the vile spirit was quickly driven away and departed from him.
        A similar case is that related by S. Gregory in his First Dialogue 
of the nun who ate a lettuce without having first made the sign of the 
Cross, and was set free by the Blessed Father Equitius.
        In the same Dialogue St. Gregory tells an example of the fourth 
case, where someone in possessed because of the heavy sin of another. The 
Blessed Bishop Fortunatus had driven the devil from a possessed man, and the 
devil began to walk about the streets of the city in the guise of a pilgrim, 
crying out: Oh, the holy man Bishop Fortunatus! See, he has cast me, a 
pilgrim, out of my lodging, and I can find no rest anywhere. Then a certain 
man sitting with his wife and son invited the pilgrim to lodge with him, and 
asking why he had been turned out, was delighted with the derogatory story 
of the holy man which the pilgrim had invented. And thereupon the devil 
entered his son, and cast him upon the fire, and killed him. And then for 
the first time did the unhappy father understand whom he had received as a 
guest.
        And fifthly, we read many examples of men being possessed for their 
own heavy sin, both in the Holy Scripture and in the passions of the Saints. 
For in I. Kings xv, Saul was possessed for disobedience to God. And, as we 
have said, we have mentioned all these so that it need not seem to anyone 
impossible that men should also be possessed because of the crimes of, and 
at the instance of, witches. And we shall be able to understand the various 
methods of such possession by quoting actual examples.
        In the time of Pope Pius II the following was the experience of one 
of us two Inquisitors before he entered upon his office in the Inquisition. 
A certain Bohemian from the town of Dachov brought his only son, a secular 
priest, to Rome to be delivered, because he was possessed. It happened that 
I, one of us Inquisitors, went into a refectory, and that priest and his 
father came and sat down at the same table with me. We saluted each other, 
and talked together, as is customary; and the father kept sighing and 
praying Almighty God that his journey might prove to have been successful. I 
felt great pity for him, and began to ask what was the reason of his journey 
and of his sorrow. Then he, in the hearing of his son who was sitting next 
to me at the table, answered: “Alas! I have a son possessed by a devil, and 
with great trouble and expense I have brought him here to be delivered.” And 
when I asked where the son was, he showed me him sitting by my side. I was a 
little frightened, and looked at him closely; and because he took his food 
with such modesty, and answered piously to all questions, I began to doubt 
that he was not possessed, but that some infirmity had happened to him. Then 
the son himself told what had happened, showing how and for how long he had 
been possessed, and saying: “A certain witch brought this evil upon me. For 
I was rebuking her on some matter concerned with the discipline of the 
Church, upbraiding her rather strongly since she was of an obstinate 
disposition, when she said that after a few days that would happen to me 
which has happened. And the devil which possesses me has told me that a 
charm was placed by the witch under a certain tree, and that until it was 
removed I could not be delivered; but he would not tell me which was the 
tree.” But I would not in the least have believed his words if he had not at 
once informed me of the facts of the case. For when I asked him about the 
length of the intervals during which he had the use of his reason more than 
is usual in the case of persons possessed, he answered: “I am only deprived 
of the use of my reason when I wish to contemplate holy things or to visit 
sacred places. For the devil specifically told me in his own words uttered 
through my mouth that, because he had up to that time been much offended by 
my sermons to the people, we would in no way allow me to preach.” For 
according to his father, he was a preacher full of grace, and loved by all. 
But I, the Inquisitor, wishing for proofs, had him taken for a fortnight and 
more to various holy places, and especially to the Church of S. Praxedes the 
Virgin, where there is part of the marble pillar to which Our Saviour was 
bound when He was scourged, and to the place where S. Peter the Apostle was 
crucified; and in all these places he uttered horrible cries while he was 
being exorcised, now saying that he wished to come forth, and after a little 
maintaining the contrary. And as we have said before, in all his behaviour 
he remained a sober priest without any eccentricity, except during the 
process of any exorcisms; and when these were finished, and the stole was 
taken from his neck, he showed no sign of madness or any immoderate action. 
But when he passed any church, and genuflected in honour of the Glorious 
Virgin, the devil made him thrust his tongue far out of his mouth; and when 
he was asked whether he could not restrain himself from doing this, he 
answered: “I cannot help myself at all, for so he uses all my limbs and 
organs, my neck, my tongue, and my lungs, whenever he pleases, causing me to 
speak or to cry out; and I hear the words as if they were spoken by myself, 
but I am altogether unable to restrain them; and when I try to engage in 
prayer he attacks me more violently, thrusting out my tongue.” And there was 
in the Church of S. Peter a column brought from Solomon's Temple, by virtue 
of which many who are obsessed with devils are liberated, because Christ had 
stood near it when He preached in the Temple; but even here he could not be 
delivered, owing to the hidden purpose of God which reserved another method 
for his liberation. For though he remained shut in by the column for a whole 
day and night, yet on the following day, after various exorcisms had been 
performed upon him, with a great concourse of people standing round, he was 
asked by which part of the column Christ had stood; and he bit the column 
with his teeth, and, crying out, showed the place, saying: “Here He stood! 
Here He stood!” And at last he said, “I will not go forth.” And when he was 
asked why, he answered in the Italian tongue (although the poor priest did 
not understand that language), They all practise such and such things, 
naming the worst vice of lustfulness. And afterwards the priest asked me, 
saying, “Father, what did those Italian words mean which came from my 
mouth?” And when I told him, he answered, “I heard the words, but I could 
not understand them.” Eventually it proved that this demoniac was of that 
sort of which the Saviour spoke in the Gospel, saying: This sort goeth not 
out save by prayer and fasting. For a venerable Bishop, who had been driven 
from his see by the Turks, piously took compassion on him, and by fasting on 
bread and water for forty days, and by prayers and exorcisms, at last 
through the grace of God delivered him and sent him back to his home 
rejoicing. 

        Now it would be a miracle if anyone in this life could thoroughly 
explain in what and in how many ways the devil possesses or injures men: yet 
we can say that, leaving out of account his method of injuring men in their 
temporal fortunes, there are five ways. For some are affected only in their 
own bodies; some both in their bodies and in their inner perceptions; some 
only in their inner perceptions; some are so punished at to be at times only 
deprived of their reason; and others are turned into the semblance of 
irrational beasts. Now the priest we have just mentioned was possessed in 
the fourth manner. For he was not touched in his worldly fortunes or in his 
own body, as it happened to the Blessed Job, over whom the Scripture clearly 
tells us that God gave the devil power, saying to Satan: Behold, all that he 
hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. And this 
refers to exterior things. But afterwards He gave him power over his body, 
saying: Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.
        And it can also be said that Job was tormented in the third manner, 
that is, in the inner perceptions of his soul as well as his body; for it is 
said in Job xii: If it is said to the Lord, My bed will console me, and I 
will take comfort to myself on my couch, then Thou wilt terrify me with 
dreams, and shake me with the horror of visions: though these dreams were 
caused by the devil, according to Nicolas of Lyra and S. Thomas: Thou wilt 
terrify me with dreams, which appear to me in sleep, and with visions which 
come to me waking by a distortion of my inner perceptions. For the phantasms 
which occur to the thoughts in the day-time can become the terror of 
sleepers, and such were visited upon Job through the infirmity of his body. 
Therefore he was so shut off from all comfort that he saw no remedy or way 
of escaping from his misery except in death, and said that he was shaken 
with horror. And no one doubts that witches can injure men in these ways 
through devils, as will be shown in what follows, how they bring injuries 
upon the fortunes of men and upon the bodies of men and animals by means of 
hailstorms.
        And there is a third way of injuring the body and the inner 
perceptions, without taking away the reason, which is shown when witches, as 
has been said, so inflame the minds of men with unlawful lust that they are 
compelled to travel long distances in the night to go to their mistresses, 
being too fast bound in the net of carnal desire.
        We may mention an example which is said to have happened in Hesse, 
in the diocese of Marburg. A certain priest was possessed, and during an 
exorcism the devil was asked for how long he had inhabited that priest. He 
answered, For seven years. And when the exorcist objected, But you have 
tormented him for hardly three years; where were you for the rest of the 
time? He answered, I was hiding in his body. And when he asked in what part 
of the body, he answered, Generally in his head. And when he was again asked 
where he was when the priest was celebrating the Sacrament, he said, I hid 
myself under his tongue. And the other said: Wretch! How were you so bold as 
not to flee from the presence of your Creator? Then the devil said: Anyone 
may hide under a bridge while a holy man is crossing, as long as he does not 
pause in his walk. But with the help of Divine grace the priest was 
delivered, whether he told the truth or not; for both he and his father are 
liars.
        The fourth method applies to the case of the priest who was 
liberated in Rome, under the proposition that the devil can enter the body, 
but not the soul, which only God can enter. But when I say that the devil 
can enter the body, I do not mean that he can occupy the essential limits of 
the body.
        I will explain this further; and in doing so it will be shown how 
devils sometimes substantially occupy a man, and at times deprive him of his 
reason. For we may say that the limits of the body can be considered in two 
ways: they may be physical or essential limits. Whenever any Angel, good or 
bad, works within the physical limits of the body, he enters the body in 
such a way as to influence its physical capacities. And in this way the good 
Angels cause imaginary visions in the good. But they are never said to enter 
into the essence of the body, since they cannot do so, either as part of it 
or as a quality of it. Not as a part, for the angelic and the human essence 
are entirely different from each other; and not as a quality, as if giving 
it its character, for it has its character by creation from God. Wherefore 
He alone is able to influence its inner essence, and to preserve it when He 
is pleased in His mercy to preserve it.
        So we conclude that, speaking of all other perfections in the good 
or defects in the wicked, when these are caused by a spirit operating in the 
head and its attributes, such a spirit enters into the head within the 
physical limits of the physical capacities of the body.
        But if the spirit is working upon the soul, then again it works from 
the outside, but in various ways. And they are said to work on the soul when 
they represent phantasms or shapes to the intellect, and not only to the 
common understanding and the outer perceptions. And when bad Angels so 
operate, there follow temptations and evil thoughts and affections, caused 
by an indirect influence upon the intellect. But good Angels cause phantasms 
of revelation which enlighten the understanding. And there is this 
difference between them; that good Angels can even directly impress 
enlightening fancies upon the intellect; but bad Angels are said not to 
enlighten but rather to darken by means of their phantasms, and they cannot 
influence the intellect directly, but only indirectly, in so far as the 
intellect is bound to take such phantasms into consideration.
        But even a good Angel is not said to enter into the soul, although 
he enlightens it: similarly a superior Angel is not said to enter into an 
inferior, although he enlightens it; but he works only from the outside, and 
co-operates in the way we have said. Therefore far less can a bad Angel 
enter the soul.
        And so the devil occupied the body of the priest in three ways. 
First, as he could enter his body within its physical limits, so he occupied 
his head by substantially inhabiting it. Secondly, he could extrinsically 
work upon his reason. And he could have so tormented him without any 
intermission or respite; but we may say that the priest had this gift from 
God, that he should not be tormented by the devil without intermission. 
Thirdly, that although he was deprived of the power of the sane use of 
words, yet he was always conscious of his words, though not of their 
meaning. And this differs from the other methods of obsession, for we 
generally read that those who are possessed are afflicted by devils without 
intermission; as is clear in the case of the lunatic in the Gospel, whose 
father said to Jesus: Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is lunatic, and 
sore vexed (S. Matthew xvii); and of the woman whom Satan had crippled for 
eighteen years, who was bowed together and could in no wise lift herself up 
(S. Luke xiii). And in these ways devils can without doubt at the instance 
of witches and with God's permission inflict torments. 




Chapter XI  Of the Method by which they can Inflict Every Sort of Infirmity, 
generally Ills of the Graver Kind.  

        But there is no bodily infirmity, not even leprosy or epilepsy, 
which cannot be caused by witches, with God's permission. And this is proved 
by the fact that no sort of infirmity is excepted by the Doctors. For a 
careful consideration of what has already been written concerning the power 
of devils and the wickedness of witches will show that this statement offers 
no difficulty. Nider also deals with this subject both in his Book of 
Precepts and in his Formicarius, where he asks: Whether witches can actually 
injure men by their witchcraft. And the question makes no exception of any 
infirmity, however incurable. And he there answers that they can do so, and 
proceeds to ask in what way and by what means.
        And as to the first, he answers, as has been shown in the First 
Question of the First Part of this treatise. And it is proved also by S. 
Isidore where he describes the operations of witches (Etym. 8, cap. 9), and 
says that they are called witches on account of the magnitude of their 
crimes; for they disturb the elements by raising up storms with the help of 
devils, they confuse the minds of men in the ways already mentioned, by 
either entirely obstructing or gravely impeding the use of their reason. He 
adds also that without the use of any poison, but by the mere virulence of 
their incantations, they can deprive men of their lives.
        It is proved also by S. Thomas in the Second Book of Sentences, 
dist. 7 and 8, and in Book IV, dist. 34, and in general all the Theologians 
write that witches can with the help of the devil bring harm upon men and 
their affairs in all the ways in which the devil alone can injure or 
deceive, namely, in their affairs, their reputation, their body, their 
reason, and their life; which means that those injuries which are caused by 
the devil without any witch, can also be caused by a witch; and even more 
readily so, on account of the greater offence which is given to the Divine 
Majesty, as has been shown above.
        In Job i and ii is found a clear case of the injury in temporal 
affairs. The injury to reputation is shown in the history of the Blessed 
Jerome, that the devil transformed himself into the appearance of S. 
Silvanus, Bishop of Nazareth, a friend of S. Jerome. And this devil 
approached a noble woman by night in her bed and began first to provoke and 
entice her with lewd words, and then invited her to perform the sinful act. 
And when she called out, the devil in the form of the saintly Bishop hid 
under the woman's bed, and being sought for and found there, he in lickerish 
language declared lyingly that he was the Bishop Silvanus. On the morrow 
therefore, when the devil had disappeared, the holy man was scandalously 
defamed; but his good name was cleared when the devil confessed at the tomb 
of S. Jerome that he had done this in an assumed body.
        The injury to the body is shown in the case of the Blessed Job, who 
was stricken by the devil with terrible sores, which are explained as a form 
of leprosy. And Sigisbert and Vincent of Beauvais (Spec. Hist. XXV, 37) both 
tell that in the time of the Emperor Louis II, in the diocese of Mainz, a 
certain devil began to thrown stones and to beat at the houses as if with a 
hammer. And then by public statements, and secret insinuations, he spread 
discord ad troubled the minds of many. Then he excited the anger of all 
against one man, whose lodging, where he was resting, he set on fire, and 
said that they were all suffering for his sins. So at last that man had to 
find his lodging in the fields. And when the priests were saying a litany on 
this account, the devil stoned many of the people with stones till he hurt 
them to bleeding; and sometimes he would desist, and sometimes rage; and 
this continued for three years, until all the houses there were burned down.
        Exampled of the injury to the use of the reason, and of the 
tormenting of the inner perceptions, are seen in those possessed and 
frenzied men of whom the Gospels tell. And as for death, and that they 
deprive some of their lives, it is proved in Tobias vi, in the case of the 
seven husbands of the virgin Sara, who were killed because of their 
lecherous lust and unbridled desired for the virgin Sara, of whom they were 
not worthy to be the husbands. Therefore it is concluded that both by 
themselves, and all the more with the help of witches, devils can injure men 
in every way without exception.
        But if it is asked whether injuries of this sort are to be ascribed 
rather to devils than to witches, it is answered that, when the devils cause 
injuries by their own direct action, then they are principally to be 
ascribed to them. But when they work through the agency of witches for the 
disparagement and offending of God and the perdition of souls, knowing that 
by this means God is made more angry and allows them greater power of doing 
evil; and because they do indeed perpetuate countless witchcrafts which the 
devil would not be allowed to bring upon men if he wished to injure men 
alone by himself, but are permitted, in the just and hidden purpose of God, 
through the agency of witches, on account of their perfidy and abjuration of 
the Catholic Faith; therefore such injuries are justly ascribed to witches 
secondarily, however much the devil may be the principal actor.
        Therefore when a woman dips a twig in water and sprinkles the water 
in the air to make it rain, although she does not herself cause the rain, 
and could not be blamed on that account, yet, because she has entered into a 
pact with the devil by which she can do this as a witch, although it is the 
devil who causes the rain, she herself nevertheless deservedly bears the 
blame, because she is an infidel and does the devil's work, surrendering 
herself to his service.
        So also when a witch makes a waxen image or some such thing in order 
to bewitch somebody; or when an image of someone appears by pouring molten 
lead into water, and some injury is done upon the image, such as piercing it 
or hurting it in any other way, when it is the bewitched man who is in 
imagination being hurt; although the injury is actually done to the image by 
some witch or some other man, and the devil in the same manner invisibly 
injures the bewitched man, yet it is deservedly ascribed to the witch. For, 
without her, God would never allow the devil to inflict the injury, nor 
would the devil on his own account try to injure the man.
        But because it has been said that in the matter of their good name 
the devils can injure men on the own account and without the co-operation of 
witches, there may arise a doubt whether the devils cannot also defame 
honest women so that they are reputed to be witches, when they appear in 
their likeness to bewitch someone; from which it would happen that such a 
woman would be defamed without cause.
        In answering this we must premise a few remarks. First, it has been 
said that the devil can do nothing without the Divine permission, as is 
shown in the First Part of this work in the last Question. It has also been 
shown that God does not allow so great power of evil against the just and 
those who live in grace, as against sinners; and as the devils have more 
power against sinners (see the text: When a strong man armed, etc.) so they 
are permitted by God to afflict them more than the just. Finally, although 
they can, with God's permission, injure the just in their affairs, their 
reputation, and their bodily health, yet, because they know that this power 
is granted them chiefly for the increase of the merits of the just, they are 
the less eager to injure them.
        Therefore it can be said that in this difficulty there are several 
points to be considered. First, the Divine permission. Secondly, the man who 
is thought to be righteous, for they who are so reputed are not always 
actually in a state of grace. Thirdly, the crime of which an innocent man 
would be suspected; for that crime in its very origin exceeds all the crimes 
of the world. Therefore it is to be said that it is granted that, with God's 
permission, an innocent person, whether or not he is in a state of grace, 
may be injured in his affairs to this particular crime and the gravity of 
the accusation (for we have often quoted S. Isidore's saying that they are 
called witches from the magnitude of their crimes), it can be said that for 
an innocent person to be defamed by the devil in a way that has been 
suggested does not seem at all possible, for many reasons.
        In the first place, it is one thing to be defamed in respect of 
vices which are committed without any expressed or tacit contract with the 
devil, such as theft, robbery, or fornication; but quite another matter to 
be defamed in respect of vices which it is impossible to accuse a man of 
having perpetrated unless he has entered upon an expressed contract with the 
devil; and such are the works of witches, which cannot be laid at their door 
unless it is by the power of devils that they bewitch men, animals and the 
fruits of the earth. Therefore, although the devil can blacken men's 
reputations in respect of other vices, yet it does not seem possible for him 
to do so in respect of this vice which cannot be perpetrated without his co-
operation.
        Besides, it has never hitherto been known to have happened that an 
innocent person has been defamed by the devil to such an extent that he was 
condemned to death for this particular crime. Furthermore, when a person is 
only under suspicion, he suffers no punishment except that which the Canon 
prescribes for his purgation, as will be shown in the Third Part of this 
work in the second method of sentencing witches.
        And it is set down there that, if such a man fails in his purgation, 
he is to be considered guilty, but that he should be solemnly adjured before 
the punishment due to his sin is proceeded with and enforced. But here we 
are dealing with actual events; and it has never yet been known that an 
innocent person has been punished on suspicion of witchcraft, and there is 
no doubt that God will never permit such a thing to happen.
        Besides, He does not suffer the innocent who are under Angelic 
protection to be suspected of smaller crimes, such as robbery and such 
things; then all the more will He preserve those who are under that 
protection from suspicion of the crime of witchcraft.
        And it is no valid objection to quote the legend of S. Germanius, 
when devils assumed the bodies of other women and sat down at table and 
slept with the husbands, deluding the latter into the belief that those 
women were in their own bodies eating and drinking with them, as we have 
mentioned before. For the women in this case are not to be held guiltless. 
For in the Canon (Episcopi 26. q. 2) such women are condemned for thinking 
that they are really and actually transported, when they are so only in 
imagination; although, as we have shown above, they are at times bodily 
transported by devils.
        But our present proposition is that they can, with God's permission, 
cause all other infirmities, with no exception; and it is to be concluded 
from what we have said that this is so. For no exception is made by the 
Doctors, and there is no reason why there should be any, since, as we have 
often said, the natural power of devils is superior to all corporeal power. 
And we have found in our experience that this is true. For although greater 
difficulty may be felt in believing that witches are able to cause leprosy 
or epilepsy, since these diseases arise from some long-standing physical 
predisposition or defect, none the less it has sometimes been found that 
even these have been caused by witchcraft. For in the diocese of Basel, in 
the district of Alsace and Lorraine, a certain honest labourer spoke roughly 
to a certain quarrelsome woman, and she angrily threatened him that she 
would soon avenge herself on him. He took little notice of her; but on the 
same night he felt a pustule grow upon his neck, and he rubbed it a little, 
and found his whole face and neck puffed up and swollen, and a horrible form 
of leprosy appeared all over his body. He immediately went to his friends 
for advice, and told them of the woman's threat, and said that he would 
stake his life on the suspicion that this had been done to him by the magic 
art of that same witch. In short, the woman was taken, questioned, and 
confessed her crimes. But when the judge asked her particularly about the 
reason for it, and how she had done it, she answered: “When that man used 
abusive words to me, I was angry and went home; and my familiar began to ask 
the reason for my ill humour. I told him, and begged him to avenge me on the 
man. And he asked what I wanted him to do to him; and I answered that I 
wished he would always have a swollen face. And the devil went away and 
afflicted the man even beyond my asking; for I had not hoped that he would 
infect him with such sore leprosy.” And so the woman was burned.
        And in the diocese of Constance, between Breisach and Freiburg, 
there is a leprous woman (unless she has paid the debt of all flesh within 
these two years) who used to tell to many people how the same thing had 
happened to her by reason of a similar quarrel which took place between her 
and another woman. For one night when she went out of the house to do 
something in front of the door, a warm wind came from the house of the other 
woman, which was opposite, and suddenly struck her face; and from that time 
she had been afflicted with the leprosy which she now suffered.
        And lastly, in the same diocese, in the territory of the Black 
Forest, a witch was being lifted by a gaoler on to the pile of wood prepared 
for her burning, and she said: ”I will pay you”; and blew into his face. And 
he was at once afflicted with a horrible leprosy all over his body, and did 
not survive many days. For the sake of brevity, the fearful crimes of this 
witch, and many more instances could be recounted, are omitted. For we have 
often found that certain people have been visited with epilepsy or the 
falling sickness by means of eggs which have been buried with dead bodies, 
especially the dead bodies of witches, together with other ceremonies of 
which we cannot speak, particularly when these eggs have been given to a 
person either in food or drink. 




Chapter XII  Of the Way how in Particular they Afflict Men with Other Like 
Infirmities 

        But who can reckon the number of infirmities which they have 
inflicted upon men, such as blindness, the sharpest pains, and contortions 
of the body? Yet we shall set down a few examples which we have seen with 
our eyes, or have been related to one of us Inquisitors.
        When an inquisition was being held on some witches in the town of 
Innsbruck, the following case, among others, was brought to light. A certain 
honest woman who had been legally married to one of the household of the 
Archduke formally deposed the following. In the time of her maidenhood she 
had been in the service of one of the citizens, whose wife became afflicted 
with grievous pains in the head; and a woman came who said she could cure 
her, and so began certain incantations and rites which she said would 
assuage the pains. And I carefully watched (said this woman) what she did, 
and saw that, against the nature of water poured into a vase, she caused 
water to rise in its vessel, together with other ceremonies which there is 
no need to mention. And considering that the pains in my mistress' head were 
not assuaged by these means, I addressed the witch in some indignation with 
these words: “I do not know what you are doing, but whatever it is, it is 
witchcraft, and you are doing it for your own profit.” Then the witch at 
once replied: “You will know in three days whether I am a witch or not.” And 
so it proved; for on the third day when I sat down and took up a spindle, I 
suddenly felt a terrible pain in my body. First it was inside me, so that it 
seemed that there was no part of my body in which I did not feel horrible 
shooting pains; then it seemed to me just as if burning coals were being 
continually heaped upon my head; thirdly, from the crown of my head to the 
soles of my feet there was no place large enough for a pinprick that was not 
covered with a rash of white pustules; and so I remained in these pains, 
crying out and wishing only for death, until the fourth day. At last my 
mistress' husband told me to go to a certain tavern; and with great 
difficulty I went, whilst he walked before, until we were in front of the 
tavern. “See!” he said to me; “there is a loaf of white bread over the 
tavern door.” “I see,” said I. Then he said: “Take it down, if you possibly 
can, for it may do you good.” And I, holding on to the door with one hand as 
much as I could, got hold of the loaf with the other. “Open it” (said my 
master) “and look carefully at what is inside.” Then, when I had broken open 
the loaf, I found many things inside it, especially some white grains very 
like the pustules on my body; and I saw also some seeds and herbs such as I 
could not eat or even look at, with the bones of serpents and other animals. 
In my astonishment I asked my master what was to be done; and he told me to 
throw it all into the fire. I did so; and behold! suddenly, not in an hour 
or even a few minutes, but at the moment when that matter was thrown into 
the fire, I regained all my former health.
        And much more was deposed against the wife of the citizen in whose 
service this woman had been, by reason of which she was not lightly but very 
strongly suspected, and especially because she had used great familiarity 
with known witches. It is presumed that, having knowledge of the spell of 
witchcraft hidden in the loaf, she had told it to her husband; and then, in 
the way described, the maid-servant recovered her health.
        To bring so great a crime into detestation, it is well that we 
should tell how another person, also a woman, was bewitched in the same 
town. An honest married woman deposed the following an oath.
        Behind my house (she said) I have a greenhouse, and my neighbour's 
garden borders on it. One day I noticed that a passage had been made from my 
neighbour's garden to my greenhouse, not without some damage being cause; 
and as I was standing in the door of my greenhouse reckoning to myself and 
bemoaning both the passage and the damage, my neighbour suddenly came up and 
asked if I suspected her. But I was frightened because of her bad 
reputation, and only answered, “The footprints on the grass are proof of the 
damage.” Then she was indignant because I had not, as she hoped, accused her 
with the actionable words, and went away murmuring; and though I could hear 
her words, I could not understand them. After a few days I became very ill 
with pains in the stomach, and the sharpest twinges shooting from my left 
side to my right, and conversely, as if two swords or knives were thrust 
through my breast; whence day and night I disturbed all the neighbours with 
my cries. And when they came from all sides to console me, it happened that 
a certain clay-worker, who was engaged in an adulterous intrigue with the 
witch, my neighbour, coming to visit me, took pity on my illness, and after 
a few words of comfort went away. But the next day he returned in a hurry, 
and, after consoling me, added: “I am going to test whether your illness is 
due to witchcraft, and if I find that it is, I shall restore your health.” 
So he took some molten lead and, while I was lying in bed, poured it into a 
bowl of water which he placed on my body. And when the lead solidified into 
a certain image and various shapes, he said: “See! your illness has been 
caused by witchcraft; and one of the instruments of that witchcraft is 
hidden under the threshold of your house door. Let us go, then, and remove 
it, and you will feel better.” So my husband and he went to remove the 
charm; and the clay-worker, taking up the threshold, told my husband to put 
his hand into the hold which then appeared, and take out whatever he found; 
and he did so. And first he brought out a waxen image about a palm long, 
perforated all over, and pierced through the sides with two needles, just in 
the same way that I felt the stabbing pains from side to side; and then 
little bags containing all sorts of things, such as grains and seeds and 
bones. And when all these things were burned, I became better, but not 
entirely well. For although the shootings and twinges stopped, and I quite 
regained my appetite for food, yet even now I am by no means fully restored 
to health. — And when we asked her why it was that she had not been 
completely restored, she answered: There are some other instruments of 
witchcraft hidden away which I cannot find. And when I asked the man how he 
knew where the first instruments were hidden, he answered: “I knew this 
through the love which prompts a friend to tell things to a friend; for your 
neighbour revealed this to me when she was coaxing me to commit adultery 
with her.” This is the story of the sick woman.
        But if I were to tell all the instances that were found in that one 
town I should need to make a book of them. For countless men and women who 
were blind, or lame, or withered, or plagued with various infirmities, 
severally took their oath that they had strong suspicions that their 
illnesses, both in general and in particular, were caused by witches, and 
that they were bound to endure those ills either for a period or right up to 
their deaths. And all that they said and testified was true, either as 
regards a specified illness or as regards a specified illness or as regards 
the death of others. For that country abounds in henchmen and knights who 
have leisure for vice, and seduce women, and then wish to cast them off when 
they desire to marry an honest woman. But they can rarely do this without 
incurring the vengeance of some witchcraft upon themselves or their wives. 
For when those women see themselves despised, they persist in tormenting not 
so much the husband as the wife, in the fond hope that, if the wife should 
die, the husband would return to his former mistress.
        For when a cook of the Archduke had married an honest girl from a 
foreign country, a witch, who had been his mistress, met them in the public 
road and, in the hearing of other honest people, foretold the bewitching and 
death of the girl, stretching out her hand and saying: “Not for long will 
you rejoice in your husband.” And at once, on the following day, she took to 
her bed, and after a few days paid the debt of all flesh, exclaiming just as 
she expired: Lo! thus I die, because that woman, with God's permission, has 
killed me by her witchcraft; yet verily I go to another and better marriage 
with God.
        In the same way, according to the evidence of public report, a 
certain soldier was slain by witchcraft, and many others whom I omit to 
mention.
        But among them there was a well-known gentleman, whom his mistress 
wished to come to her on one occasion to pass the night; but he sent his 
servant to tell her that he could not visit her that night because he was 
busy. She promptly flew into a rage, and said to the servant: Go and tell 
your master that he will not trouble me for long. On the very next day he 
was taken ill, and he was buried within a week.
        And there are witches who can bewitch their judges by a mere look or 
glance from their eyes, and publicly boast that they cannot be punished; and 
when malefactors have been imprisoned for their crimes, and exposed to the 
severest torture to make them tell the truth, these witches can endow them 
with such an obstinacy of preserving silence that they are unable to lay 
bare their crimes.
        And there are some who, in order to accomplish their evil charms and 
spells, beat and stab the Crucifix, and utter the filthiest words against 
the Purity of the Most Glorious Virgin MARY, casting the foulest aspersions 
on the Nativity of Our Saviour from Her inviolate womb. It is not expedient 
to repeat those vile words, nor yet to describe their detestable crimes, as 
the narrative would give too great offence to the ears of the pious; but 
they are all kept and preserved in writing, detailing the manner in which a 
certain baptized Jewess had instructed other young girls. And one of them, 
named Walpurgis, being in the same year at the point of death, and being 
urged by those who stood round her to confess her sins, exclaimed: I have 
given myself body and soul to the devil; there is no hope of forgiveness for 
me; and so died.
        These particulars have not been written to the shame, but rather to 
the praise and glory of the most illustrious Archduke. For he was truly a 
Catholic Prince, and laboured very zealously with the Church at Brixen to 
exterminate witches. But they are written rather in hate and loathing of so 
great a crime, and that men may not cease to avenge their wrongs, and the 
insults and offences these wretches offer to the Creator and our Holy Faith, 
to say nothing of the temporal losses which they cause. For this is their 
greatest and gravest crime, namely, that they abjure the Faith. 




Chapter XIII  How Witch Midwives commit most Horrid Crimes when they either 
Kill Children or Offer them to Devils in most Accursed Wise.  

        We must not omit to mention the injuries done to children by witch 
midwives, first by killing them, and secondly by blasphemously offering them 
to devils. In the diocese of Strasburg and in the town of Zabern there is an 
honest woman very devoted to the Blessed Virgin MARY, who tells the 
following experience of hers to all the guests that come to the tavern which 
she keeps, known by the sign of the Black Eagle.
        I was, she says, pregnant by my lawful husband, now dead, and as my 
time approached, a certain midwife importuned me to engage her to assist at 
the birth of my child. But I knew her bad reputation, and although I had 
decided to engage another woman, pretended with conciliatory words to agree 
to her request. But when the pains came upon me, and I had brought in 
another midwife, the first one was very angry, and hardly a week later came 
into my room one night with two other women, and approached the bed where I 
was lying. And when I tried to call my husband, who was sleeping in another 
room, all the use was taken away from my limbs and tongue, so that except 
for seeing and hearing I could not move a muscle. And the witch, standing 
between the other two, said: “See! this vile woman, who would not take me 
for her midwife, shall not win through unpunished.” The other two standing 
be her pleaded for me, saying: “She has never harmed any of us.” But the 
witch added: “Because she has offended me I am going to put something into 
her entrails; but, to please you, she shall not feel any pain for half a 
year, but after that time she shall be tortured enough.” So she came up and 
touched my belly with her hands; and it seemed to me that she took out my 
entrails, and put in something which, however, I could not see. And when 
they had gone away, and I had recovered my power of speech, I called my 
husband as soon as possible, and told him what had happened. But he put it 
down to pregnancy, and said: “You pregnant women are always suffering from 
fancies and delusions.” And when he would by no means believe me, I replied: 
“I have been given six months' grace, and if, after that time, no torment 
comes to me, I shall believe you.”
        She related this to her son, a cleric who was then Archdeacon of the 
district, and who came to visit her on the same day. And what happened? When 
exactly six months had passed, such a terrible pain came into her belly that 
she could not help disturbing everybody with her cries day and night. And 
because, as has been said, she was most devout to the Virgin, the Queen of 
Mercy, she fasted with bread and water every Saturday, so that she believed 
that she was delivered by Her intercession. For one day, when she wanted to 
perform an action of nature, all those unclean things fell from her body; 
and she called her husband and son, and said: “Are those fancies? Did I not 
say that after a half a year the truth would be known? Or who ever saw me 
ear thorns, bones, and even bits of wood?” For there were brambles as long 
as a palm, as well as a quantity of other things.
        Moreover (as was said in the First Part of the work), it was shown 
by the confession of the servant, who was brought to judgement at Breisach, 
that the greatest injuries to the Faith as regards the heresy of witches are 
done by midwives; and this is made clearer than daylight itself by the 
confessions of some who were afterwards burned.
        For in the diocese of Basel at the town of Dann, a witch who was 
burned confessed that she had killed more than forty children, by sticking a 
needle through the crowns of their heads into their brains, as they came out 
from the womb.
        Finally, another woman in the diocese of Strasburg confessed that 
she had killed more children than she could count. And she was caught in 
this way. She had been called from one town to another to act as midwife to 
a certain woman, and, having performed her office, was going back home. But 
as she went out of the town gate, the arm of a newly born child fell out of 
the cloak she had wrapped around her, in whose folds the arm had been 
concealed. This was seen by those who were sitting in the gateway, and when 
she had gone on, they picked up from the ground what they took to be a piece 
of meat; but when they looked more closely and saw that it was not a piece 
of meat, but recognized it by its fingers as a child's arm, they reported it 
to the magistrates, and it was found that a child had died before baptism, 
lacking an arm. So the witch was taken and questioned, and confessed the 
crime, and that she had, as has been said, killed more children than she 
could count.
        Now the reason for such practices is as follows: It is to be 
presumed that witches are compelled to do such things at the command of evil 
spirits, and sometimes against their own wills. For the devil knows that, 
because of the pain of loss, or original sin, such children are debarred 
from entering the Kingdom of Heaven. And by this means the Last Judgement is 
delayed, when the devils will be condemned to eternal torture; since the 
number of the elect os more slowly completed, on the fulfilment of which the 
world will be consumed. And also, as has already been shown, witches are 
taught by the devil to confect from the limbs of such children an unguent 
which is very useful for their spells.
        But in order to bring so great a sin into utter detestation, we must 
not pass over in silence the following horrible crime. For when they do not 
kill the child, they blasphemously offer it to the devil in this manner. As 
soon as the child is born, the midwife, if the mother herself is not a 
witch, carries it out of the room on the pretext of warming it, raises it 
up, and offers it to the Prince of Devils, that is Lucifer, and to all the 
devils. And this is done by the kitchen fire.
        A certain man relates that he noticed that his wife, when her time 
came to give birth, against the usual custom of women in childbirth, did not 
allow any woman to approach the bed except her own daughter, who acted as 
midwife. Wishing to know the reason for this, he hid himself in the house 
and saw the whole order of the sacrilege and dedication to the devil, as it 
has been described. He saw also, as it seemed to him, that without any human 
support, but by the power of the devil, the child was climbing up the chain 
by which the cooking-pots were suspended. In great consternation both at the 
terrible words of the invocation of the devils, and at the other iniquitous 
ceremonies, he strongly insisted that the child should be baptized 
immediately. While it was being carried to the next village, where there was 
a church, and when they had to cross a bridge over a certain river, he drew 
his sword and ran at his daughter, who was carrying the child, saying in the 
hearing of two others who were with them: “You shall not carry the child 
over the bridge; for either it must cross the bridge by itself, or you shall 
be drowned in the river.” The daughter was terrified and, together with the 
other women in company, asked him if he were in his right mind (for he had 
hidden what had happened from all the others except the two men who were 
with him). Then he answered: “You vile drab, by your magic arts you made the 
child climb the chain in the kitchen; now make it cross the bridge with no 
on carrying it, or I shall drown you in the river.” And so, being compelled, 
she put the child down on the bridge, and invoked the devil by her art; and 
suddenly the child was seen on the other side of the bridge. And when the 
child had been baptized, and he had returned home, since he now had 
witnesses to convict his daughter of witchcraft (for he could not prove the 
former crime of the oblation to the devil, inasmuch as he had been the only 
witness of the sacrilegious ritual), he accused bother daughter and mother 
before the judge after their period of purgation; and they were both burned, 
and the crime of midwives of making that sacrilegious offering was 
discovered.
        But here the doubt arises: to what end or purpose is the 
sacrilegious offering of children, and how does it benefit the devils? To 
this it can be said that the devils do this for three reasons, which serve 
three most wicked purposes. The first reason arises from their pride, which 
always increases; as it is said: “They that hate Thee have lifted up the 
head.” For they try as far as possible to conform with divine rites and 
ceremonies. Secondly, they can more easily deceive men under the mask of an 
outwardly seeming pious action. For in the same way they entice young 
virgins and boys into their power; for though they might solicit such by 
means of evil and corrupt men, yet they rather deceive them by magic mirrors 
and reflections seen in witches' finger-nails, and lure them on in the 
belief that they love chastity, whereas they hate it. For the devil hates 
above all the Blessed Virgin, because she bruised his head. Just so in this 
oblation of children they deceive the minds of witches into the vice of 
infidelity under the appearance of a virtuous acts. And the third reason is, 
that the perfidy of witches may grow, to the devils' own gain, when they 
have witches dedicated to them from their very cradles.
        And this sacrilege affects the child in three ways. In the first 
place, visible offerings to God are made of visible things, such as wine of 
bread or the fruits of the earth, as a sign of honour and subjection to Him, 
as it is said in Ecclesiasticus xxv: Thou shalt not appear empty before the 
Lord. And such offerings cannot and must not afterwards be put to profane 
uses. Therefore the holy Father, S. John Damascene, says: The oblations 
which are offered in church belong only to the priests, but not that they 
should divert them to their own uses, but that they should faithfully 
distribute them, partly in the observance of divine worship, and partly for 
the use of the poor. From this it follows that a child who has been offered 
to the devil in sign of subjection and homage to him cannot possibly be 
dedicated by Catholics to a holy life, in worthy and fruitful service to God 
for the benefit of himself and others.
        For who can say that the sins of the mothers and of other do not 
redound in punishment upon the children? Perhaps someone will quote that 
saying of the prophet: “The sons shall not bear the iniquity of the father.” 
But there is that other passage in Exodus xx: I am a jealous God, visiting 
the sins of the father upon the children unto the third and fourth 
generation. Now the meaning of these two sayings is as follows. The first 
speaks of spiritual punishment in the judgement of Heaven or God, and not in 
the judgement of men. And this is the punishment of the soul, such as loss 
or the forfeiture of glory, or the punishment of pain, that is, of the 
torment of eternal fire. And with such punishments no one is punished except 
for his own sin, either inherited as original sin or committed as actual 
sin.
        The second text speaks of those who imitate the sins of their 
father, as Gratian has explained (I, q. 4, etc.); and there he gives other 
explanations as to how the judgement of God inflicts other punishments on a 
man, not only for his own sins which he has committed, or which he might 
commit (but is prevented by punishment from committing), but also for the 
sins of others.
        And it cannot be argued that when a man is punished without cause, 
and without sin, which should be the cause of punishment. For according to 
the rule of law, no one must be punished without sin, unless there is some 
cause of punishment. And we can say that there is always a most just cause, 
though it may not be known to us: see S. Augustine, XXIV, 4. And if we 
cannot in the result penetrate the depth of God's judgement, yet we know 
that what He has said is true, and what He has done is just.
        But there is this distinction to be observed in innocent children 
who are offered to devils not by their mothers when they are witches, but by 
midwives who, as we have said, secretly take from the embrace and the womb 
of an honest mother. Such children are not so cut off from grace that they 
must necessarily become prone to such crimes; but it is piously to be 
believed that they may rather cultivate their mothers' virtues.
        The second result to the children of this sacrilege is as follows. 
When a man offers himself as a sacrifice to God, he recognizes God as his 
Beginning and his End; and this sacrifice is more worthy than all the 
external sacrifices which he makes, having its beginning in his creation and 
its end in his glorification, as it is said: A sacrifice to God is an 
afflicted spirit, etc. In the same way, when a witch offers a child to the 
devils, she commends it body and soul to him as its beginning and its end in 
eternal damnation; wherefore not without some miracle can the child be set 
free from the payment of so great a debt.
        And we read often in history of children whom their mothers, in some 
passion or mental disturbance, have unthinkingly offered to the devil from 
the very womb, and how it is only with the very greatest difficulty that 
they can, when they have grown to adult age, be delivered from that bondage 
which the devil has, with God's permission, usurped to himself. And of this 
the Book of Examples, Most Blessed Virgin MARY, affords many illustrations; 
a notable instance being that of the man whom the Supreme Pontiff was unable 
to deliver from the torments of the devil, but at last he was sent to a holy 
man living in the East, and finally with great difficulty was delivered from 
his bondage through the intercession of the Most Glorious Virgin Herself.
        And if God so severely punishes even such a thoughtless, I will not 
say sacrifice, but commendation used angrily by a mother when her husband, 
after copulating with her, says, I hope a child will come of it; and she 
answers, May the child go to the devil! How much greater must be the 
punishment when the Divine Majesty is offended in the way we have described! 

        The third effect of this sacrilegious oblation is to inculcate an 
habitual inclination to cast spells upon men, animals, and the fruits of the 
earth. This is shown by S. Thomas in the 2nd Book, quest, 108, where he 
speaks of temporal punishment, how some are punished for the sins of others. 
For he says that, bodily speaking, sons are part of their fathers' 
possessions, and servants and animals belong to their masters; therefore 
when a man is punished in all his possessions, it follows that often the 
sons suffer for the fathers.
        And this is quite a different matter from what has been said about 
God visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and 
fourth generation. For there it is a question of those who imitate their 
fathers' sins, but here we speak of those who suffer instead of their 
fathers, when they do not imitate their sins by committing them in fact, but 
only inherit the results of their sins. For in this way the son born to 
David in adultery died very soon; and the animals of the Amalekites were 
ordered to be killed. Nevertheless, there is much mystery in all this.
        Taking into consideration all that we have said, we may well 
conclude that such children are always, up to the end of their lives, 
predisposed to the perpetration of witchcraft. For just as God sanctifies 
that which is dedicated to Him, as is proved by the deeds of the Saints, 
when parents offer to God the fruit which they have generated; so also the 
devil does not cease to infect with evil that which is offered to him. Many 
examples can be found in the Old and New Testaments. For so were many of the 
Patriarchs and Prophets, such as Isaac, Samuel, and Samson; and so were 
Alexis and Nicolas, and many more, guided by much grace to a holy life.
        Finally, we know from experience that the daughters of witches are 
always suspected of similar practises, as imitators of their mothers' 
crimes; and that indeed the whole of a witch's progeny is infected. And the 
reason for this and for all that has been said before is, that according to 
their pact with the devil, they always have to leave behind them and 
carefully instruct a survivor, so that they may fulfil their vow to do all 
they can to increase the number of witches. For how else could it happen, as 
it has very often been found, that tender girls of eight or ten years have 
raised up tempests and hailstorms, unless they had been dedicated to the 
devil under such a pact by their mothers. For the children could not do such 
things of themselves by abjuring the Faith, which is how all adult witches 
have to begin, since they have no knowledge of any single article of the 
Faith. We will recount an example of such a child.
        In the duchy of Swabia a certain farmer went to his fields with his 
little daughter, hardly eight years old, to look at his crops, and began 
complaining about the drought, saying: Alas! when will it rain? The girl 
heard him, and in the simplicity of her heart said: Father, if you want it 
to rain, I can soon make it come. And her father said to her: What? Do you 
know how to make it rain? And the girl answered: I can make it rain, and I 
can make hailstorms and tempests too. And the father asked: Who taught you? 
And she answered: My mother did, but she told me not to tell anybody. Then 
the father asked: How did she teach you? And she answered: She sent me to a 
master who will do anything I ask at any time. But her father said: Have you 
ever seen him? And she said: I have sometimes seen men coming in and out to 
my mother; and when I asked her who they were, she told that they were our 
masters to whom she had given me, and that they were powerful and rich 
patrons. The father was terrified, and asked her if she could raise a 
hailstorm then. And the girl said: Yes, if I had a little water. Then he led 
the girl by the hand to a stream, and said: Do it, but only on our land. 
Then the girl put her hand in the water and stirred it in the name of her 
master, as her mother had taught her; and behold! the rain fell only on that 
land. Seeing this, the father said: Make it hail now, but only on one of our 
fields. And when the girl had done this, the father was convinced by the 
evidence, and accused his wife before the judge. And the wife was taken and 
convicted and burned; but the daughter was reconciled and solemnly dedicated 
to God, since which hour she could no more work these spells and charms. 




Chapter XIV  Here followeth how Witches Injure Cattle in Various Ways.  

        When S. Paul said, Doth God care for oxen? he meant that, though all 
things are subject to Divine providence, both man and beast each in its 
degree, as the Psalmist says, yet the sons of men are especially in His 
governance and under the protection of His wings. I say, therefore, if men 
are injured by witches, with God's permission, both the innocent and just as 
well as sinners, and if parents are bewitched in their children, as being 
part of their possessions, who can then presume to doubt that, with God's 
permission, various injuries can be brought by witches upon cattle and the 
fruits of the earth, which are also part of men's possessions? For so was 
Job stricken by the devil and lost all his cattle. So also there is not even 
the smallest farm where women do not injure each other's cows, by drying up 
their milk, and very often killing them.
        But first let us consider the smallest of these injuries, that of 
drying up the milk. If it is asked how they can do this, it can be answered 
that, according to Blessed Albert in his Book on Animals, milk is naturally 
menstrual in any animal; and, like another flux in women, when it is not 
stopped by some natural infirmity, it is due to witchcraft that it is 
stopped. Now the flow of milk is naturally stopped when the animal becomes 
pregnant; and it is stopped by an accidental infirmity when the animal eats 
some herb the nature of which is to dry up the milk and make the cow ill.
        But they can cause this in various ways by witchcraft. For on the 
more holy nights according to the instructions of the devil and for the 
greater offence to the Divine Majesty of God, a witch will sit down in a 
corner of her house with a pail between her legs, stick a knife or some 
instrument in the wall or a post, and make as if to milk it with her hands. 
Then she summons her familiar who always works with her in everything, and 
tells him that she wishes to milk a certain cow from a certain house, which 
is healthy and abounding in milk. And suddenly the devil takes the milk from 
the udder of that cow, and brings it to where the witch is sitting, as if it 
were flowing from the knife.
        But when this is publicly preached to the people they get no bad 
information by it; for however much anyone may invoke the devil, and think 
that by this alone he can do this thing, he deceives himself, because he is 
without the foundation of that perfidy, not having rendered homage to the 
devil or abjured the Faith. I have set this down because some have thought 
that several of the matter of which I have written ought not to be preacher 
to the people, on account of the danger of giving them evil knowledge; 
whereas it is impossible for anyone to learn from a preacher how to perform 
any of the things that have been mentioned. But they have been written 
rather to bring so great a crime into detestation, and should be preached 
from the pulpit, so that judges may be more eager to punish the horrible 
crime of the abnegation of the Faith. Yet they should not always be preached 
in this way; for the secular mind pays more attention to temporal losses, 
being more concerned with earthly than spiritual matters; therefore when 
witches can be accused of inflicting temporal loss, judges are more zealous 
to punish them. But who can fathom the cunning of the devil?
        I know of some men in a certain city who wished to eat some May 
butter one May time. And as they were walking along they came to a meadow 
and say down by a stream; and one of them, who had formed some open or tacit 
pact with the devil, said: I will get you the best May butter. And at once 
he took off his clothes and went into the stream, not standing up but 
sitting with his back against the current; and while the others looked on, 
he uttered certain words, and moved the water with his hands behind his 
back; and in a short time he brought out a great quantity of butter of the 
sort that the country women sell in the market in May. And the others tasted 
it and declared that it was the very best butter.
        From this we can deduce first the following fact concerning their 
practices. They are either true witches, by reason of an expressed pact 
formed with the devil, or they know by some tacit understanding that the 
devil will do what they ask. In the first case there is no need for any 
discussion, for such are true witches. But in the second case, then they 
owed the devil's help to the fact that they were blasphemously offered to 
the devil by a midwife or by their own mothers.
        But it may be objected that the devil perhaps brought the butter 
without any compact, expressed or tacit, and without any previous dedication 
to himself. It is answered that no one can ever use the devil's help in such 
matters without invoking him; and that by that very act of seeking help from 
the devil he is an apostate from the Faith. This is the decision of S. 
Thomas in the Second Book of Sentences, dist. 8, on the question, Whether it 
is apostasy from the Faith to use the devil's help. And although Blessed 
Albert the Great agrees with the other Doctors, yet he says more expressly 
that in such matters there is always apostasy either in word or in deed. For 
if invocations, conjurations, fumigations and adorations are used, then an 
open pact is formed with the devil, even if there has been no surrender of 
body and soul together with explicit abjuration of the Faith either wholly 
or in part. For by the mere invocation of the devil a man commits open 
verbal apostasy. But if there is no spoken invocation, but only a bare 
action from which follows something that could not be done without the 
devil's help, then whether a man does it be beginning in the name of the 
devil, or with some other unknown words, or without any words but with that 
intention; then, says Blessed Albert, it is apostasy of deed, because that 
action is looked for from the devil. But since to expect or receive anything 
from the devil is always a disparagement of the Faith, it is also apostasy.
        So it is concluded that, by whatever means that sorcerer procured 
the butter, it was done with either a tacit or an expressed pact with the 
devil; and since, if it had been with an expressed pact, he would have 
behaved after the usual manner of witches, it is probably that there was a 
tacit or secret pact, originating either from himself or from his mother or 
a midwife. And I say that it arose from himself, since he only went through 
certain motions, and expected the devil to produce the effect.
        The second conclusion we can draw from this and similar practices is 
this. The devil cannot create new species of things; therefore when natural 
butter suddenly came out of the water, the devil did not do this by changing 
the water into milk, but by taking butter from some place where it was kept 
and bringing it to the man's hand. Or else he took natural milk from a 
natural cow and suddenly churned it into natural butter; for while the art 
of women takes a little time to make butter, the devil could do it in the 
shortest space of time and bring it to the man.
        It is in the same way that certain dealers in magic, when they find 
themselves in need of wine or some such necessity, merely go out in the 
night with a flask or vessel, and bring it back suddenly filled with wine. 
For then the devil takes natural wine from some vessel and fills their 
flasks for them.
        And with regard to the manner whereby witches kill animals and 
cattle, it should be said that they act very much as they do in the case of 
men. They can bewitch them by a touch and a look, or by a look only; or by 
placing under the threshold of the stable door, or near the place where they 
go to water, some charm or periapt of witchcraft.
        For in this way those witches who were burned at Ratisbon, of whom 
we shall say more later on, were always incited by the devil to bewitch the 
best horses and the fattest cattle. And when they were asked how they did 
so, one of them named Agnes said that they hid certain things under the 
threshold of the stable door. And, asked what sort of things, she said: The 
bones of different kinds of animals. She was further asked in whose name 
they did this, and answered, In the name of the devil and all the other 
devils. And there was another of them, named Anna, who had killed twenty-
three horses in succession belonging to one of the citizens who was a 
carrier. This man at last, when he had bought his twenty-fourth horse and 
reduced to extreme poverty, stood in his stable and said to the witch, who 
was standing in the door of her house: “See, I have bought a horse, and I 
swear to God and His Holy Mother that if this horse dies I shall kill you 
with my own hands.” At that the witch was frightened, and left the horse 
alone. But when she was taken and asked how she had done these things, she 
answered that she had done nothing but dig a little hole, after which the 
devil had put in it certain things unknown to her. From this it is concluded 
that the witch co-operates sufficiently if it is only by a touch or a look; 
for the devil is permitted no power of injuring creatures without some co-
operation on the part of the witch, as has been shown before. And this is 
for the great offence to the Divine Majesty.
        For shepherds have often seen animals in the fields give three or 
four jumps into the air, and then suddenly fall to the ground and die; and 
this is caused by the power of witches at the instance of the devil.
        In the diocese of Strasburg, between the town of Fiessen and Mount 
Ferrer, a certain very rich man affirmed that more than forty oxen and cows 
belonging to him and others had been bewitched in the Alps within the space 
of one year, and that there had been no natural plague or sickness to cause 
it. To prove this, he said that when cattle die from some change plague or 
disease, they do not do so all at once, but by degrees; but that this 
witchcraft had suddenly taken all the strength from them, and therefore 
everyone judged that they had been killed by witchcraft. I have said forty 
head of cattle, but I believe he put the number higher than that. However, 
it is very true that many cattle are said to have been bewitched in some 
districts, especially in the Alps; and it is known that this form of 
witchcraft if unhappily most widespread. We shall consider some similar 
cases later, in the chapter where we discuss the remedies for cattle that 
have been bewitched. 




Chapter XV  How they Raise and Stir up Hailstorms and Tempests, and Cause 
Lightning to Blast both Men and Beasts.  

        That devils and their disciples can by witchcraft cause lightnings 
and hailstorms and tempests, and that the devils have power from God to do 
this, and their disciples do so with God's permission, is proved by Holy 
Scripture in Job i and ii. For the devil received power from God, and 
immediately caused it to happen that the Sabeans took away from Job fifty 
yoke of oxen and five hundred asses, and then fire came from heaven and 
consumed seven thousand camels, and a great wind came and smote down this 
house, killing his seven sons and his three daughters, and all the young 
men, that is to say, the servants, except him who brought the news, were 
killed; and finally the devil smote the body of the holy man with the most 
terrible sores, and caused his wife and his three friends to vex him 
grievously.
        S. Thomas in his commentary on Job says as follows: It must be 
confessed that, with God's permission, the devils can disturb the air, raise 
up winds, and make the fire fall from heaven. For although, in the matter of 
taking various shapes, corporeal nature is not at the command of any Angel, 
either good or bad, but only at that of God the Creator, yet in the matter 
of local motion corporeal nature has to obey the spiritual nature. And this 
truth is clearly exemplified in man himself; for at the mere command of the 
will, which exists subjectively in the soul, the limbs are moved to perform 
that which they have been willed to do. Therefore whatever can be 
accomplished by mere local motion, this not only good but bad spirits can by 
their natural power accomplish, unless God should forbid it. But winds and 
rain and other similar disturbances of the air can be caused by the mere 
movement of vapours released from the earth or the water; therefore the 
natural power of devils is sufficient to cause such things. So says S. 
Thomas.
        For God in His justice using the devils as his agents of punishment 
inflicts the evils which come to us who live in this world. Therefore, with 
reference to that in the Psalms: “He called a famine on the land, and wasted 
all their substance of bread.”; the gloss says: God allowed this evil to be 
caused by the bad Angels who are in charge of such matters; and by famine is 
meant the Angel in charge of famine.
        We refer the reader also to what has been written above on the 
question as to whether witches must always have the devil's help to aid them 
in their works, and concerning the three kinds of harm which the devils at 
times inflict without the agency of a witch. But the devils are more eager 
to injure men with the help of a witch, since in this way God is the more 
offended, and greater power is given to them to torment and punish.
        And relevant to this subject is what the Doctors have written in the 
Second book of Sentences, dist. 6, on the question whether there is a 
special place assigned to the bad Angels in the clouds of the air. For in 
devils there are three things to be considered - their nature, their duty 
and their sin; and by nature they belong to the empyrean of heaven, through 
sin to the lower hell, but by reason of the duty assigned to them, as we 
have said, as ministers of punishment to the wicked and trial to the good, 
their place is in the clouds of the air. For they do not dwell here with us 
on the earth lest they should plague us too much; but in the air and around 
the fiery sphere they can so bring together the active and passive agents 
that, when God permits, they can bring down fire and lightning from heaven.
        A story is told in the Formicarius of a certain man who had been 
taken, and was asked by the judge how they went about to raise up hailstorms 
and tempests, and whether it was easy for them to do so. He answered: We can 
easily cause hailstorms, but we cannot do all the harm that we wish, because 
of the guardianship of good Angels. And he added: We can only injure those 
who are deprived of God's help; but we cannot hurt those who make the sign 
of the Cross. And this is how we got to work: first we use certain words in 
the fields to implore the chief of the devils to send one of his servants to 
strike the man whom we name. Then, when the devil has come, we sacrifice to 
him a black cock at two cross-roads, throwing it up into the air; and when 
the devil has received this, he performs our wish and stirs up the air, but 
not always in the places which we have named, and, according to the 
permission of the living God, sends down hailstorms and lightnings.
        In the same work we hear of a certain leader or heresiarch of 
witches named Staufer, who lived in Berne and the adjacent country, and used 
publicly to boast that, whenever he liked, he could change himself into a 
mouse in the sight of his rivals and slip through the hands of his deadly 
enemies; and that he had often escaped from the hands of his mortal foes in 
this manner. But when the Divine justice wished to put an end to his 
wickedness, some of his enemies lay in wait for him cautiously and saw him 
sitting in a basket near a window, and suddenly pierced him through with 
swords and spears, so that he miserably died for his crimes. Yet he left 
behind him a disciple, named Hoppo, who had also for his master that Stadlin 
whom we have mentioned before in the sixth chapter.
        These two could, whenever they pleased, cause the third part of the 
manure or straw or corn to pass invisibly from a neighbour's field to their 
own; they could raise the most violent hailstorms and destructive winds and 
lightning; could cast into the water in the sight of their parents children 
walking by the water-side, when there was no one else in sight; could cause 
barrenness in men and animals; could reveal hidden things to others; could 
in many ways injure men in their affairs or their bodies; could at times 
kill whom they would by lightning; and could cause many other plagues, when 
and where the justice of God permitted such things to be done.
        It is better to add an instance which came within our own 
experience. For in the diocese of Constance, twenty-eight German miles from 
the town of Ratisbon in the direction of Salzburg, a violent hailstorm 
destroyed all the fruit, crops and vineyards in a belt one mile wide, so 
that the vines hardly bore fruit for three years. This was brought to the 
notice of the Inquisition, since the people clamoured for an inquiry to be 
held; many beside all the townsmen being of the opinion that it was caused 
by witchcraft. Accordingly it was agreed after fifteen days' formal 
deliberation that it was a case of witchcraft for us to consider; and among 
a large number of suspects, we particularly examined two women, one named 
Agnes, a bath-woman, and the other Anna von Mindelheim. These two were taken 
and shut up separately in different prisons, neither of them knowing in the 
least what had happened to the other. On the following day the bath-woman 
was very gently questioned in the presence of a notary by the chief 
magistrate, a justice named Gelre very zealous for the Faith, and by the 
other magistrates with him; and although she was undoubtedly well provided 
with that evil gift of silence which is the constant bane of judges, and at 
the first trial affirmed that she was innocent of any crime against man or 
woman; yet, in the Divine mercy that so great a crime should not pass 
unpunished, suddenly, when she had been freed from her chains, although it 
was in the torture chamber, she fully laid bare all the crimes which she had 
committed. For when she was questioned by the Notary of the Inquisition upon 
the accusations which had been brought against her of harm done to men and 
cattle, by reason of which she had been gravely suspected of being a witch, 
although there had been no witness to prove that she had abjured the Faith 
or performed coitus with an Incubus devil (for she had been most secret); 
nevertheless, after she had confessed to the harm which she had caused to 
animals and men, she acknowledged also all that she was asked concerning the 
abjuration of the Faith, and copulation committed with an Incubus devil; 
saying that for more than eighteen years she had given her body to an 
Incubus devil, with a complete abnegation of the Faith.
        After this she was asked whether she knew anything about the 
hailstorm which we have mentioned, and answered that she did. And, being 
asked how and in what way, she answered: “I was in my house, and at midday a 
familiar came to me and told me to go with a little water on to the field or 
plain of Kuppel (for so is it named). And when I asked what he wanted to do 
with the water, he said that he wanted to make it rain. So I went out at the 
town gate, and found the devil standing under a tree.” The judge asked her, 
under which tree; and she said, “Under that one opposite that tower,” 
pointing it out. Asked what she did under the tree, she said, “The devil 
told me to dig a hole and pour the water into it.” Asked whether they say 
down together, she said, “I sat down, but the devil stood up.” Then she was, 
with what words and in what manner she had stirred the water; and she 
answered, “I stirred it with my finger, and called on the name of the devil 
himself and all the other devils.” Again the judge asked what was done with 
the water, and she answered: “It disappeared, and the devil took it up into 
the air.” Then she was asked if she had any associate, and answered: “Under 
another tree opposite I had a companion (naming the other capture witch, 
Anna von Mindelheim), but I do not know what she did.” Finally, the bath-
woman was asked how long it was between the taking up of the water the 
hailstorm; and she answered: “There was just sufficient interval of time to 
allow me to get back to my house.”
        But (and this is remarkable) when on the next day the other witch 
had at first been exposed to the very gentlest questions, being suspended 
hardly clear of the ground by her thumbs, after she had been set quite free, 
she disclosed the whole matter without the slightest discrepancy from what 
the other had told; agreeing as to the place, that it was under such a tree 
and the other had been under another; as to the method, namely, of stirring 
water poured into a hole in the name of the devil and all the devils; and as 
to the interval of time, that the hailstorm had come after her devil had 
taken the water up into the air and she had returned home. Accordingly, on 
the third day they were burned. And the bath-woman was contrite and 
confessed, and commended herself to God, saying that she would die with a 
willing heart if she could escape the tortures of the devil, and held in her 
hand a cross which she kissed. But the other witch scorned her for doing so. 
And this one had consorted with an Incubus devil for more than twenty years 
with a complete abjuration of the Faith, and had done far more harm than the 
former witch to men, cattle and the fruits of the earth, as is shown in the 
preserved record of their trial.
        These instances must serve, since indeed countless examples of this 
sort of mischief could be recounted. But very often men and beasts and 
storehouses are struck by lightning by the power of devils; and the cause of 
this seems to be more hidden and ambiguous, since it often appears to happen 
by Divine permission without the co-operation of any witch. However, it has 
been found that witches have freely confessed that they have done such 
things, and there are various instances of it, which could be mentioned, in 
addition to what has already been said. Therefore it is reasonable to 
conclude that, just as easily as they raise hailstorms, so can they cause 
lightning and storms at sea; and so no doubt at all remains on these points. 




Chapter XVI  Of Three Ways in which Men and Women may be Discovered to be 
Addicted to Witchcraft: Divided into Three Heads: and First of the 
Witchcraft of Archers.  

        For our present purpose the last class of witchcraft is that which 
is practised in three forms by men; and first we must consider the seven 
deadly and horrible crimes which are committed by wizards who are archers. 
For first, on the Sacred Day of the Passion of Our Lord, that is to say, on 
Good Friday, as it is called, during the solemnization of the Mass of the 
Presanctified they shoot with arrows, as at a target, at the most sacred 
image of the Crucifix. Oh, the cruelty and injury to the Saviour! Secondly, 
though there is some doubt whether they have to utter a verbal form of 
apostasy to the devil in addition to that apostasy of deed, yet whether it 
be so or not, no greater injury to the Faith can be done by a Christian. For 
it is certain that, if such things were done by an infidel, they would be of 
no efficacy; for no such easy method of gratifying their hostility to the 
Faith is granted to them. Therefore these wretches ought to consider the 
truth and power of the Catholic Faith, for the confirmation of which God 
justly permits such crimes.
        Thirdly, such an archer has to shoot three or four arrows in this 
way, and as a consequence he is able to kill on any day just the same number 
of men. Fourthly, they have the following assurance from the devil; that 
though they must first actually set eyes on the man they wish to kill, and 
must bend their whole will on killing him, yet it matter not where the man 
may shut himself up, for he cannot be protected, but the arrows which have 
been shot will be carried and struck into him by the devil.
        Fifthly, they can shoot an arrow with such precision as to shoot a 
penny from a person's head without hurting his head, and they can continue 
to do this indefinitely. Sixthly, in order to gain this power they have to 
offer homage of body and soul to the devil. We shall give some instances of 
this sort of practice.
        For a certain prince of the Rhineland, named Eberhard Longbeard 
because he let his beard grow, had, before he was sixty years old, acquired 
for himself some of the Imperial territory, and was besieging a certain 
castle named Lendenbrunnen because of the raids which were made by the men 
of the castle. And he had in his company a wizard of this sort, named 
Puncker, who so molested the men of the castle that he killed them all in 
succession with his arrows, except one. And this is how he proceeded. 
Whenever he had looked at a man, it did not matter where that man went to or 
hid himself, he had only to loose an arrow and that man was mortally wounded 
and killed; and he was able to shoot three such arrows every day because he 
had shot three arrows at the image of the Saviour. It is probable that the 
devil favours the number three more than any other, because it represents an 
effective denial of the Holy Trinity. But after he had shot those three 
arrows, he could only shoot with the same uncertainty as other men. At last 
one of the men of the castle called out to him mockingly, “Puncker, will you 
not at least spare the ring which hangs in the gate?” And he answered from 
outside in the night, “No; I shall take it away on the day that the castle 
is captured.” And he fulfilled his promise: for when, as has been said, all 
were killed except one, and the castle had been taken, he took that ring and 
hung it in his own house at Rorbach in the diocese of Worms, where it can be 
seen hanging to this day. But afterwards he was one night killed with their 
spades by some peasants whom he had injured, and he perished in his sins.
        It is told also of this man, that a very eminent person wished to 
have proof of his skill, and for a test placed his little son before the 
target with a penny on his cap, and ordered him to shoot the penny away 
without removing the cap. The wizard said that he would do it, but with 
reluctance, not being sure whether the devil was seducing him to his death. 
But, yielding to the persuasions of the prince, he placed one arrow in 
readiness in the cord which was slung over his should, fitted another to his 
bow, and shot the penny from the cap without hurting the boy. Seeing this, 
the prince asked him why he had placed the arrow in that cord; and he 
answered: “If I had been deceived by the devil and had killed my son, since 
I should have had to die I would quickly have shot you with the other arrow 
to avenge my death.”
        And though such wickedness is permitted by God for the proving and 
chastisement of the faithful, nevertheless more powerful miracles are 
performed by the Saviour's mercy for the strengthening and glory of the 
Faith.
        For in the diocese of Constance, near the castle of Hohenzorn and a 
convent of nuns, there is a newly-built church where may be seen an image of 
Our Saviour pierced with an arrow and bleeding. And the truth of this 
miracle is shown as follows. A miserable wretch who wished to be assured by 
the devil of having three or four arrows with which he could, in the manner 
we have told, kill whom he pleased, shot and pierced with an arrow (just as 
it is still seen) a certain Crucifix at a crossroad; and when it 
miraculously began to bleed, the wretch was stuck motionless in his steps by 
Divine power. And when he was asked by a passer-by why he stood fixed there, 
he shook his head, and trembling in his arms and his hands, in which he held 
the bow, and all over his body, could answer nothing. So the other looked 
about him, and saw the Crucifix with the arrow and the blood, and said: “You 
villain, you have pierced the image of Our Lord!” And calling some others, 
he told them to see that he did not escape (although, as has been said, he 
could not move), and ran to the castle and told what had happened. And they 
came down and found the wretched man in the same place; and when they had 
questioned him, and he had confessed his crime, he was removed from that 
district by public justice, and suffered a miserable death in merited 
expiation of his deeds.
        But, alas! how horrible it is to think that human perversity is not 
afraid to countenance such crimes. For it is said that in the halls of the 
great such men are maintained to glory in their crimes in open contempt of 
the Faith, to the heavy offence of the Divine Majesty, and in scorn of Our 
Redeemer; and are permitted to boast of their deeds.
        Wherefore such protectors, defenders and patrons are to be judged 
not only heretics, but even apostates from the Faith, and are to be punished 
in the manner that will be told. And this is the seventh deadly sin of these 
wizards. For first they are by very law excommunicated; and if the patrons 
are clerics they are degraded and deprived of all office and benefit, nor 
can they be restored except by a special indulgence from the Apostolic See. 
Also, if after their proscription such protectors remain obstinate in their 
excommunication for the period of a year, they are to be condemned as 
heretics.
        This is in accordance with the Canon Law; for, in Book VI, it 
touches on the question of direct or indirect interference with the 
proceedings of Diocesans and Inquisitors in the cause of the Faith, and 
mentions the aforesaid punishment to be inflicted after a year. For it say: 
We forbid any interference from Potentates, temporal Lords and Rulers, and 
their Officials, etc. Anyone may refer to the chapter.
        And further, that witches and their protectors are by very law to be 
excommunicated is shown in the Canon of the suppressing of the heresy of 
witchcraft; especially where it says: We excommunicate and anathematize all 
heretics, Catharists, Sectaries . . . and others, by whatever names they are 
known, etc. And with these it includes all their sympathizers and 
protectors, and others; saying later on: Also we excommunicate all 
followers, protectors, defenders and patrons of such heretics.
        The Canon Law prescribes various penalties which are incurred within 
the space of a year by such heretics, whether laymen or clerics, where it 
says: We place under the ban of excommunication all their protectors, 
patrons and defenders, so that when any such has been so sentenced and has 
scorned to recant his heresy, within a year from that time he shall be 
considered an outlaw, and shall not be admitted to any office or council, 
nor be able to vote in the election of such officers, nor be allowed free 
opportunity of giving evidence; he shall not succeed to any inheritance, and 
no one shall be held responsible for any business transaction with him. If 
he be a judge, his judgement shall not stand, nor shall any case be brought 
to his hearing. If he be an advocate, he shall not be allowed to plead. If 
he be a notary, no instrument drawn up by him shall have any weight, but is 
to be condemned together with its condemned author; and similar penalties 
are decreed for the holders of other offices. But if he be a cleric, he is 
to be degraded from all office and benefice; for, his guilt being the 
greater, it is more heavily avenged. And if any such, after they have been 
marked down by the Church, contemptuously try to ignore their punishment, 
the sentence of excommunication is to be rigorously applied to them to the 
extreme limits of vengeance. And the clergy shall not administer the 
Sacraments of the Church to such heretics, nor presume to give them 
Christian burial, nor accept their alms and oblations, on pain of being 
deprived of their office, to which they can in no way be restored without a 
special indulgence from the Apostolic See.
        There are, finally, many other penalties incurred by such heretics 
even when they do not persist in their obstinacy for a year, and also by 
their children and grandchildren: for they can be degraded by a Bishop or by 
an Inquisitor, declared deprived of all titles, possessions, honours and 
ecclesiastical benefits, in fine of all public offices whatsoever. But this 
is only when they are persistently and obstinately impenitent. Also their 
sons to the second generation may be disqualified and unable to obtain 
either ecclesiastical preferment or public office; but this is to be 
understood only of the descendants on the father's side, and not on the 
mother's, and only of those who are impenitent. Also all their followers, 
protectors, fautors and patrons shall be denied all right of petition or 
appeal; and this is explained as meaning that, after a verdict has been 
returned that they are such heretics, then can they make no appeal before 
their sentence, however much they may have been in any respect ill-used or 
treated with undue severity. Much more could be adduced in support of our 
standpoint, but this is sufficient.
        Now for the better understanding of what has been said, some few 
points are to be discussed. And first, if a prince or secular potentate 
employ such a wizard as we have described for the destruction of some castle 
in a just war, and with his help crushes the tyranny of wicked men; is his 
whole army to be considered as protectors and patrons of that wizard, and to 
be subjected to the penalties we have mentioned? The answer seems to be that 
the rigour of justice must be tempered on account of their numbers. For the 
leader, with his counsellors and advisers, must be considered to have aided 
and abetted such witchcraft, and they are by law implicated in the aforesaid 
penalties when, after being warned by their spiritual advisers, they have 
persisted in their bad course; and then they are to be judged protectors and 
patrons, and are to be punished. But the rest of the army, since they have 
no part in their leaders' council, but are simply prepared to risk their 
lives in defence of their country, although they may view with approval the 
feats of the wizard, nevertheless escape the sentence of excommunication; 
but they must in their confession acknowledge the guilt of the wizard, and 
in their absolution by the confessor must receive a solemn warning to hold 
all such practices for ever in detestation, and as far as they are able 
drive from their land all such wizards.
        It may be asked by whom such princes are to be absolved when they 
come to their senses, whether by their own spiritual advisers or by the 
Inquisitors? We answer that, if they repent, they may be absolved either by 
their spiritual advisers, or by the Inquisitors. This is provided in the 
Canon Law concerning the proceedings to be taken, in the fear of God and as 
a warning to men, against heretics, their followers, protectors, patrons and 
fautors, as also against those who are accused or suspected of heresy. But 
if any of the above, forswearing his former lapse into heresy, wish to 
return to the unity of the Church, he may receive the benefit of absolution 
provided by Holy Church.
        A prince, or any other, may be said to have returned to his senses 
when he has delivered up the wizard to be punished for his offences against 
the Creator; when he has banished from his dominions all who have been found 
guilty of witchcraft or heresy; when he is truly penitent for the past; and 
when, as becomes a Catholic prince, he is firmly determined in his mind not 
to show any favour to any other such wizard. 

        But it may be asked to whom should such a man be surrendered, in 
what court he should be tried, and whether he is to be judged as one openly 
apprehended in heresy? The first difficulty is specially dealt with at the 
beginning of the Third part; namely, whether it is the business of a secular 
or of an ecclesiastical judge to punish such men. It is manifestly stated in 
the Canon Law that no temporal magistrate or judge is competent to try a 
case of heresy without a licence from the Bishops and Inquisitors, or at 
least under the hand of someone who has authority from them. But when it 
says that the secular courts have no jurisdiction in this matter because the 
crime of heresy is exclusively ecclesiastical, this does not seem to apply 
to the case of witches; for the crimes of witches are not exclusively 
ecclesiastical, but are also civil on account of the temporal damage which 
they do. Nevertheless, as will be shown later, although the ecclesiastical 
judge must try and judge the case, yet it is for the secular judge to carry 
out the sentence and inflict punishment, as is shown in the chapters of the 
Canon no the abolition of heresy, and on excommunication. Wherefore, even if 
he does surrender the witch to the Ordinary to be judged, the secular judge 
has still the power of punishing him after he has been delivered back by the 
Bishop; and with the consent of the Bishop, the secular judge can even 
perform both offices, that is, he can both sentence and punish.
        And it is no valid objection to say that such wizards are rather 
apostates than heretics; for both these are offenders against the Faith; but 
whereas a heretic is only in some partial or total doubt with regard to the 
Faith, witchcraft in its very essence implies apostasy intent from the 
Faith. For it is a heavier sin to corrupt the Faith, which is the life of 
the soul, than to falsify money, which is a prop to the life of the body. 
And if counterfeiters of money, and other malefactors, are immediately 
sentenced to death, how much more just and equitable it is that such 
heretics and apostates should be immediately put to death when they are 
convicted.
        Here was have also answered the second difficulty, namely, by what 
court and judge such men are to be punished. But this will be more fully 
considered in the Third Part of this work, where we treat of the methods of 
sentencing the offenders, and how one taken in open heresy is to be 
sentenced (see the eighth and twelfth methods), and of the question whether 
one who becomes penitent is still to be put to death.
        For if a simple heretic constantly backslides as often as he 
repents, he is to be put to death according to the Canon Law; and this is 
reasonable according to S. Thomas, as being for the general good. For if 
relapsed heretics are often and often received back and allowed to live and 
keep their temporal goods, it might prejudice the salvation of others, both 
because they might infect others if they fell again, and because, if they 
were to escape without punishment, others would have less fear in being 
infected with heresy. And their very relapse argues that they are not 
constant in the Faith, and they are therefore justly to be put to death. And 
so we ought to say here that, if a mere suspicion of inconstancy is 
sufficient warrant for an ecclesiastical judge to hand over such a 
backslider to the secular court to be put to death, much more must he do so 
in the case of one who refuses to prove his penitence and change of heart by 
handing over to the secular court an apostate or any witch, but rather 
leaves free and unchecked one whom the secular judge wishes to put to death 
as a witch according to the law, on account of the temporal injuries of 
which he has been guilty. But if the witch is penitent, the ecclesiastical 
judge must first absolve him from the excommunication which he has incurred 
because of the heresy of witchcraft. Also when a heretic is penitent, he can 
be received back into the bosom of the Church for the salvation of his soul. 
This matter is further discussed in the First Question of the Third Part, 
and this is ample for the present. Only let all Rulers consider how strictly 
and minutely they will be called to account by that terrible Judge; for 
indeed there will be a severe judgement on those in authority who allow such 
wizards to live and work their injuries against the Creator.
        The other two classes of wizards belong to the general category of 
those who can use incantations and sacrilegious charms so as to render 
certain weapons incapable of harming or wounding them; and these are divided 
into two kinds. For the first class resemble the archer-wizards of whom we 
have just spoken, in that they also mutilate the image of Christ crucified. 
For example, if they wish their head to be immune from any wound from a 
weapon or from any blow, they take off the head of the Crucifix; if they 
wish their neck to be invulnerable, they take off its neck; if their arm, 
they take off, or at least shorten, the arm, and so on. And sometimes they 
take away all above the waist, or below it. And in proof of this, hardly one 
in ten of the Crucifixes set up at cross-roads or in the fields can be found 
whole and intact. And some carry the limbs thus broken off about with them, 
and others procure their invulnerability by means of sacred or unknown 
words: therefore there is this difference between them. The first sort 
resemble the archer-wizards in their contempt of the Faith and their 
mutilation of the image of the Saviour, and are therefore to be considered 
as true apostates, and so much be judged when they do not approach them in 
wickedness. For they seem only to act for the protection of their own 
bodies, either above the waist or below it, or of the whole body. Therefore 
they are not to be judged as penitent heretics and not relapsed, when they 
have been convicted as wizards and have repented; and they are to be imposed 
a penance according to the eighth manner, with solemn adjuration and 
incarceration, as is shown in the Third Part of this work.
        The second sort can magically enchant weapons so that they can walk 
on them with bare feet, and similar strange feats do they perform (for 
according to S. Isidore, Etym. VIII, enchanters are those who have some 
skill to perform wonders by means of words). And there is a distinction to 
be made between them; for some perform their incantations by means of sacred 
words, or charms written up over the sick, and these are lawful provided 
that seven conditions are observed, as will be shown later where we deal 
with the methods of curing those who are bewitched. But incantations made 
over weapons by certain secret words, or cases where the charms written for 
the sick have been taken down, are matters for the judge's attention. For 
when they use words of which they do not themselves know the meaning, or 
characters and signs which are not the sign of the Cross, such practices are 
altogether to be repudiated, and good men should beware of the cruel arts of 
these warlocks. And if they will not desist from such deeds, they must be 
judges as suspects although lightly, and the manner of sentencing such after 
the second method will be shown later. For they are not untainted with the 
sin of heresy; for deeds of this kind can only be done with the help of the 
devil, and, as we have shown, he who uses such help is judged to be an 
apostate from the Faith. Yet on the plea of ignorance or of mending their 
ways they may be dealt with more leniently than the archer-wizards.
        It is more commonly found that traders and merchants are in the 
habit of carrying about them such charms and runes; and since they partake 
of the nature of incantations, a complete riddance must be made of them, 
either by the father confessor in the box, or in open court by the 
ecclesiastical judge. For these unknown words and characters imply a tacit 
compact with the devil, who secretly uses such things for his own purpose, 
granting their wearers their wishes, that he may lure them on to worse 
things. Therefore in the court of law such men must be warned and sentenced 
after the second method. In the box, the confessor must examine the charm, 
and if he is unwilling to throw it away altogether, he must delete the 
unknown words and signs, but may keep any Gospel words or the sign of the 
Cross.
        Now with regard to all these classes of wizards, and especially the 
archers, it must be noted, as has been declared above, whether they are to 
be judged as heretics openly taken in that sin; and we have touched on this 
matter even before in the First Question of the First Part. And there it is 
shown that S. Bernard says that there are three ways by which a man can be 
convicted of heresy: either by the evidence of the fact when in simply 
heresy he publicly preaches his errors, or by the credible evidence of 
witnesses, or by a man's own confession. S. Bernard also explains the 
meaning of some of the words of the Canon Law in this connexion, as was 
shown in the First Question of the First Part of this work.
        It is clear, therefore, that archer-wizards, and those mages who 
enchant other weapons, are to be considered as manifestly guilty of flagrant 
heresy, through some expressed pact with the devil, since it is obvious that 
their feats would not be possible without the devil's help.
        Secondly, it is equally clear that the patrons, protectors and 
defenders of such men are manifestly to be judged in the same way, and 
subjected to the prescribed punishments. For there is not in their case, as 
there may be in that of several others, any doubt as to whether they are to 
be regarded as lightly or strongly or gravely suspected; but they are always 
very grave sinners against the Faith, and are always visited by God with a 
miserable death.
        For it is told that a certain prince used to keep such wizards in 
his favour, and by their help unduly oppressed a certain city in matters of 
commerce. And when one of his retainers remonstrated with him over this, he 
threw away all fear of God and exclaimed, “God grant that I may die in this 
place if I am oppressing them unjustly.” Divine vengeance quickly followed 
these words, and he was stricken down with sudden death. And this vengeance 
was not so much on account of his unjust oppression as because of his 
patronage of heresy.
        Thirdly, it is clear that all Bishops and Rulers who do not essay 
their utmost to suppress crimes of this sort, with their authors and 
patrons, are themselves to be judged as evident abettors of the crime, and 
are manifestly to be punished in the prescribed manner. 




QUESTION II 



Question II  The Methods of Destroying and Curing Witchcraft
Introduction, wherein is Set Forth the Difficulty of this Question.  

        Is it lawful to remove witchcraft by means of further witchcraft, or 
by any other forbidden means?
        It is argued that it is not; for it has already been shown that in 
the Second Book of Sentences, and the 8th Distinction, all the Doctors agree 
that it is unlawful to use the help of devils, since to do so involves 
apostasy from the Faith. And, it is argued, no witchcraft can be removed 
without the help of devils. For it is submitted that it must be cured either 
by human power, or by diabolic, or by Divine power. It cannot be by the 
first; for the lower power cannot counteract the higher, having no control 
over that which is outside its own natural capacity. Neither can it be by 
Divine power; for this would be a miracle, which God performs only at His 
own will, and not at the instance of men. For when His Mother besought 
Christ to perform a miracle to supply the need for wine, He answered: Woman, 
what have I to do with thee? And the Doctors explain this as meaning, “What 
association is there between you and me in the working of a miracle?” Also 
it appears that it is very rarely that men are delivered from a bewitchment 
by calling on God's help or the prayers of the Saints. Therefore it follows 
that they can only be delivered by the help of devils; and it is unlawful to 
seek such help.
        Again it is pointed out that the common method in practice of taking 
off a bewitchment, although it is quite unlawful, is for the bewitched 
persons to resort to wise women, by whom they are very frequently cured, and 
not by priests or exorcists. So experience shows that such curses are 
effected by the help of devils, which it is unlawful to seek; therefore it 
cannot be lawful thus to cure a bewitchment, but it must patiently be borne.
        It is further argued that S. Thomas and S. Bonaventura, in Book IV, 
dist. 34, have said that a bewitchment must be permanent because it can have 
no human remedy; for if there is a remedy, it is either unknown to men or 
unlawful. And these words are taken to mean that this infirmity is incurable 
and must be regarded as permanent; and they add that, even if God should 
provide a remedy by coercing the devil, and the devil should remove his 
plague from a man, and the man should be cured, that cure would not be a 
human one. Therefore, unless God should cure it, it is not lawful for a man 
to himself to try in any way to look for a cure.
        In the same place these two Doctors add that it is unlawful even to 
seek a remedy by the superadding of another bewitchment. For they say that, 
granting this to be possible, and that the original spell be removed, yet 
the witchcraft is none the less to be considered permanent; for it is in no 
way lawful to invoke the devil's help through witchcraft.
        Further, it is submitted that the exorcisms of the Church are not 
always effective in the repression of devils in the matter of bodily 
afflictions, since such are cured only at the discretion of God; but they 
are effective always against those molestations of devils against which they 
are chiefly instituted, as, for example, against men who are possessed, or 
in the matter of exorcising children.
        Again, it does not follow that, because the devil has been given 
power over someone on account of his sins, that power must come to an end on 
the cessation of the sin. For very often a man may cease from sinning, but 
his sins still remain. So it seems from these sayings that the two Doctors 
we have cited were of the opinion that it is unlawful to remove a 
bewitchment, but that it must be suffered, just as it is permitted by the 
Lord God, Who can remove it when it seems good to Him.
        Against this opinion it is argued that just as God and Nature do not 
abound in superfluities, so also they are not deficient in necessities; and 
it is a necessity that there should be given to the faithful against such 
devils' work not only a means of protection (of which we treat in the 
beginning of this Second Part), but also curative remedies. For otherwise 
the faithful would not be sufficiently provided for by God, and the works of 
the devil would seem to be stronger than God's work.
        Also there is the gloss on that text in Job. There is no power on 
earth, etc. The gloss says that, although the devil has power over all 
things human, he is nevertheless subject to the merits of the Saints, and 
even to the merits of saintly men in this life.
        Again, S. Augustine (De moribus Ecclesiae) says: No Angel is more 
powerful than our mind, when we hold fast to God. For if power is a virtue 
in this world, then the mind that keeps close to God is more sublime than 
the whole world. Therefore such minds can undo the works of the devil.
        Answer. Here are two weighty opinions which, it seems, are at 
complete variance with each other.
        For there are certain Theologians and Canonists who agree that it is 
lawful to remove witchcraft even by superstitious and vain means. And of 
this opinion are Duns Scotus, Henry of Segusio, and Godfrey, and all the 
Canonists. But it is the opinion of the other Theologians, especially the 
ancient ones, and of some of the modern ones, such as S. Thomas, S. 
Bonaventura, Blessed Albert, Peter a Palude, and many others, that in no 
case must evil be done that good may result, and that a man ought rather to 
die than consent to be cured by superstitious and vain means.
        Let us now examine their opinions, with a view to bringing them as 
far as possible into agreement. Scotus, in his Fourth Book, dist. 34, on 
obstructions and impotence caused by witchcraft, says that it is foolish to 
maintain that it is unlawful to remove a bewitchment even by superstitious 
and vain means, and that to do so is in no way contrary to the Faith; for he 
who destroys the work of the devil is not an accessory to such works, but 
believes that the devil has the power and inclination to help in the 
infliction of an injury only so long as the outward token or sign of that 
injury endures. Therefore when that token is destroyed he puts an end to the 
injury. And he adds that it is meritorious to destroy the works of the 
devil. But, as he speaks of tokens, we will give an example.
        There are women who discover a witch by the following token. When a 
cow's supply of milk has been diminished by witchcraft, they hang a pail of 
milk over the fire, and uttering certain superstitious words, beat the pail 
with a stick. And though it is the pail that the women beat, yet the devil 
carries all those blows to the back of the witch; and in this way both the 
witch and the devil are made weary. But the devil does this in order that he 
may lead on the woman who beats the pail to worse practices. And so, if it 
were not for the risk which it entails, there would be no difficulty in 
accepting the opinion of this learned Doctor. Many other examples could be 
given.
        Henry of Segusio, in his eloquent Summa on genital impotence caused 
by witchcraft, says that in such cases recourse must be had to the remedies 
of physicians; and although some of these remedies seem to be vain and 
superstitious cantrips and charms, yet everyone must be trusted in his own 
profession, and the Church may well tolerate the suppression of vanities by 
means of others vanities.
        Ubertinus also, in his Fourth Book, uses these words: A bewitchment 
can be removed either by prayer or by the same art by which it was 
inflicted.
        Godfrey says in his Summa: A bewitchment cannot always be removed by 
him who caused it, either because he is dead, or because he does not know 
how to cure it, or because the necessary charm is lost. But if he knows how 
to effect relief, it is lawful for him to cure it. Our author is speaking 
against those who said that an obstruction of the carnal act could not be 
caused by witchcraft, and that it could never be permanent, and therefore 
did not annul a marriage already contracted.
        Besides, those who maintained that no spell is permanent were moved 
by the following reasons: they thought that every bewitchment could be 
removed either by another magic spell, or by the exorcisms of the Church 
which are ordained for the suppression of the devil's power, or by true 
penitence, since the devil has power only over sinners. So in the first 
respect they agree with the opinion of the others, namely, that a spell can 
be removed by superstitious means.
        But S. Thomas is of the contrary opinion when he says: If a spell 
cannot be revoked except by some unlawful means, such as the devil's help or 
anything of that sort, even if it is known that it can be revoked in that 
way, it is nevertheless to be considered permanent; for the remedy is not 
lawful.
        Of the same opinion are S. Bonaventura, Peter a Palude, Blessed 
Albert, and all the Theologians. For, touching briefly on the question of 
invoking the help of the devil either tacitly or expressedly, they seem to 
hold that such spells may only be removed by lawful exorcism or true 
penitence (as is set down in the Canon Law concerning sortilege), being 
moved, as it seems, by the considerations mentioned in the beginning of this 
Question.
        But it is expedient to bring these various opinions of the learned 
Doctors as far as possible into agreement, and this can be done in one 
respect. For this purpose it is to be noted that the methods by which a 
spell of witchcraft can be removed are as follows: - either by the agency of 
another witch and another spell; or without the agency of a witch, but by 
means of magic and unlawful ceremonies. And this last method may be divided 
into two; namely, the use of ceremonies which are both unlawful and vain, or 
the use of ceremonies which are vain but not unlawful.
        The first remedy is altogether unlawful, in respect both of the 
agent and of the remedy itself. But it may be accomplished in two ways; 
either with some injury to him who worked the spell, or without an injury, 
but with magic and unlawful ceremonies. In the latter case it can be 
included with the second method, namely, that by which the spell is removed 
not by the agency of a witch, but by magic and unlawful ceremonies; and in 
this case it is still to be judged unlawful, though not to the same extent 
as the first method.
        We may summarize the position as follows. There are three conditions 
by which a remedy is rendered unlawful. First, when a spell is removed 
through the agency of another witch, and by further witchcraft, that is, by 
the power of some devil. Secondly, when it is not removed by a witch, but by 
some honest person, in such a way, however, that the spell is by some 
magical remedy transferred from one person to another; and this again is 
unlawful. Thirdly, when the spell is removed without imposing it on another 
person, but some open or tacit invocation of devils is used; and then again 
it is unlawful.
        And it is with reference to these methods that the Theologians say 
that it is better to die than to consent to them. But there are two other 
methods by which, according to the Canonists, it is lawful, or not idle and 
vain, to remove a spell; and that such methods may be used when all the 
remedies of the Church, such as exorcisms and the prayers of the Saints and 
true penitence, have been tried and have failed. But for a clearer 
understanding of these remedies we will recount some examples known to our 
experience.
        In the time of Pope Nicolas there had come to Rome on some business 
a certain Bishop from Germany, whom it is charitable not to name although he 
had now paid the debt of all nature. There he fell in love with a girl, and 
sent her to his diocese in charge of two servants and certain other of his 
possessions, including some rich jewels, which were indeed very valuable, 
and began to think in her heart that, if only the Bishop were to die through 
some witchcraft, she would be able to take possession of the rings, the 
pendants and carcanets. The next night the Bishop suddenly fell ill, and the 
physicians and his servants gravely suspected that he had been poisoned; for 
there was such a fire in his breast that he had to take continual draughts 
of cold water to assuage it. On the third day, when there seemed no hope of 
his life, an old woman came and begged that she might see him. So they let 
her in, and she promised the Bishop that she could heal him if he would 
agree to her proposals. When the Bishop asked what it was to which he had to 
agree in order to regain his health, as he so greatly desired, the old woman 
answered: Your illness has ben caused by a spell of witchcraft, and you can 
only be healed by another spell, which will transfer the illness from you to 
the witch who caused it, so that she will die. The Bishop was astounded; and 
seeing that he could be healed in no other way, and not wishing to come to a 
rash decision, decided to ask the advice of the Pope. Now the Holy Father 
loved him very dearly, and when he learned that he could only be healed by 
the death of the witch, he agreed to permit the lesser of two evils, and 
signed this permission with his seal. So the old woman was again approached 
and told that both he and the Pope had agreed to the death of the witch, on 
condition that he was restored to his former health; and the old woman went 
away, promising him that he would be healed on the following night. And 
behold! when about the middle of the night he felt himself cured and free 
from all illness, he sent a messenger to learn what had happened to the 
girl; and he came back and reported that she had suddenly been taken ill in 
the middle of the night while sleeping by her mother's side.
        It is to be understood that at the very same hour and moment the 
illness left the Bishop and afflicted the girl witch, through the agency of 
the old witch; and so the evil spirit, by ceasing to plague the Bishop, 
appeared to restore him to health by chance, whereas it was not he but God 
who permitted him to afflict im, and it was God Who properly speaking 
restored him; and the devil, by reason of his compact with the second witch, 
who envied the fortune of the girl, has to afflict the Bishop's mistress. 
And it must be thought that those two evil spells were not worked by one 
devil serving two persons, but by two devils serving two separate witches. 
For the devils do not work against themselves, but work as much as possible 
in agreement for the perdition of souls. 

        Finally, the Bishop went out of compassion to visit the girl; but 
when he entered the room, she received him with horrible execrations, crying 
out: May you and she who wrought your cure be damned for ever! And the 
Bishop tried to soften her mind to penitence, and told her that he forgave 
her all her wrongs; but she turned her face away and said: I have no hope of 
pardon, but commend my soul to all the devils in hell; and died miserably. 
But the Bishop returned home with joy and thankfulness.
        Here it is to be noted that a privilege granted to one does not 
construe a precedent for all, and the dispensation of the Pope in this case 
does not argue that it is lawful in all cases.
        Nider in his Formicarius refers to the same master, for he says: The 
following method is sometimes employed for removing or taking vengeance for 
a spell of witchcraft. Someone who has been bewitched either in himself or 
in his possessions comes to a witch desiring to know how has injured him. 
Then the witch pours molten lead into water until, by the work of the devil, 
some image is formed by the solidified lead. On this, the witch asks his 
enemy to be hurt, so that he may recognize him by that hurt. And when he has 
chosen, the witch immediately pierces or wounds with a knife the leaden 
image in the same part, and shows him the place by which he can recognize 
the guilty person. And it is found by experience that, just in the same way 
as the leaden image is hurt, so is the witch hurt who cast the spell.
        But of this sort of remedy I say, and of others like it, that 
generally they are unlawful; although human weakness, in the hope of 
obtaining pardon from God, is very often ensnared in such practices, being 
more careful for the health of the body than for that of the soul.
        The second kind of cure which is wrought by witches who remove a 
spell again requires an expressed pact with the devil, but is not 
accompanied by any injury to another person. And in what light such witches 
should be considered, and how they are to be recognized, will be shown later 
in the fifteenth method of sentencing witches, for they are always found at 
intervals of one or two German miles, and these seem to be able to cure any 
who have been bewitched by another witch in their own district. Some of them 
claim to be able to effect such cures at all times; some that they can only 
cure those bewitched in the neighbouring signiory; others that they can only 
perform their cures with the consent of the witch who cast the original 
spell.
        And it is known that these women have entered into an open pact with 
the devil, because they reveal secret matters to those who come to them to 
be cured. For they suddenly disclose to such a person the cause of his 
calamity, telling him that he has been bewitched either in his own person or 
in his possessions because of some quarrel he has had with a neighbour or 
with some other woman or man; and at times, in order to keep their criminal 
practices secret, they enjoin upon their clients some pilgrimage or other 
pious work. But to approach such women in order to be cured is all the more 
pernicious because they seem to bring greater contempt upon the Faith than 
others who effect their cures by means of a merely tacit compact with the 
devil.
        For they who resort to such witches are thinking more of their 
bodily health than of God, and besides that, God cuts short their lives to 
punish them for taking into their own hands the vengeance for their wrongs. 
For so the Divine vengeance overtook Saul, because he first cast out of the 
land all magicians and wizards, and afterwards consulted a witch; wherefore 
he was slain in battle with his sons, I. Samuel xxviii, and I. Paralipomenon 
x. And for the same reason the sick Ochozias had to die, IV. Kings i 
(Ahaziah; II. Kings i. A.V.).
        Also the who consult such witches are regarded as defamed, and 
cannot be allowed to bring an accusation, as will be shown in the Third 
Part; and they are by law to be sentenced to capital punishment, as was said 
in the First Question of this work.
        But alas! O Lord God, Who art just in all Thy judgements, who shall 
deliver the poor who are bewitched and cry out in their ceaseless pains? For 
our sins are so great, and the enemy is so strong; and where are they who 
can undo the works of the devil by lawful exorcisms? This one remedy appears 
to be left; that judges should, by various penalties, keep such wickedness 
as far as possible in check by punishing the witches who are the cause of 
it; that so they may deprive the sick of the opportunity of consulting 
witches. But, alas! no one understands this in his heart; but they all seek 
for their own gain instead of that of JESUS Christ.
        For so many people used to go to be freed from spells to that witch 
in Reichshofen, whom we have already mentioned, that the Count of the castle 
set up a toll-booth, and all who were bewitched in their own persons or in 
their possessions had to pay a penny before they could visit her house; and 
he boasted that he made a substantial profit by this means.
        We know from experience that there are many such witches in the 
diocese of Constance: not that this diocese is more infected than others, 
since this form of infidelity is general in all dioceses; but this diocese 
has been more thoroughly sifted. It was found that daily resort was being 
made to a man named Hengst by a very large concourse of poor folk who had 
been bewitched, and with our own eyes we saw such crowds in the village of 
Eningen, that certainly the poor never flocked to any shrine of the Blessed 
Virgin, or to a Holy Well or a Hermitage, in such numbers as they went to 
that sorcerer. For in the very coldest winter weather, when all the highways 
and byways were snow-bound, they came to him from two or three miles round 
in spite of the greatest difficulties; and some were cured, but others not. 
For I suppose that all spells are not equally easy to remove, on account of 
various obstacles, as has been said before. And these witches remove spells 
by means of an open invocation of devils after the manner of the second kind 
of remedies, which are unlawful, but not to the same extent as the first 
kind.
        The third kind of remedy is that which is wrought by means of 
certain superstitious ceremonies, but without any injury to anyone, and not 
by an overt witch. An example of this method is as follows:
        A certain market merchant in the town of Spires deposed that the 
following experience had happened to him. I was staying, he said, in Swabia 
in a well-known nobleman's castle, and one day after dinner I was strolling 
at my ease with two of the servants in the fields, when a woman met us. But 
while she was still a long way off my companions recognized her, and one of 
them said to me, “Cross yourself quickly,” and the other one urged me in 
like manner. I asked them what they feared, and they answered, “The most 
dangerous witch in the whole Province is coming to meet us, and she can cast 
a spell on men by only looking at them.” But I obstinately boasted that I 
had never been afraid of such; and hardly had I uttered the words before I 
felt myself grievously hurt in the left foot, so that I could not move it 
from the ground or take a step without the greatest pain. Whereupon they 
quickly sent to the castle for a horse for me, and thus led me back. But the 
pains went on increasing for three days.
        The people of the castle, understanding that I had been bewitched, 
related what had happened to a certain peasant who lived about a mile away, 
whom they knew to have skill in removing spells. This man quickly came and, 
after examining my foot, said, “I will test whether these pains are due to a 
natural cause; and if I find that they are due to witchcraft, I will cure 
you with the help of God; but if they are not, you must have recourse to 
natural remedies.” Whereupon I made reply, “If I can be cured without any 
magic, and with the help of God, I will gladly agree; but I will have 
nothing to do with the devil, nor do I wish for his help.” And the peasant 
promised that he would use none except lawful means, and that he would cure 
me by the help of God, provided that he could make certain that my pains 
were due to witchcraft. So I consented to his proposals. Then he took molten 
lead (in the manner of another witch whom we have mentioned), and held it in 
an iron ladle over my foot, and poured it into a bowl of water; and 
immediately there appeared the shapes of various things, as if thorns and 
hairs and bones and such things had been put into the bowl. “Now,” he said, 
“I see that this infirmity is not natural, but certainly due to witchcraft.” 
And when I asked him how he could tell this from the molten lead, he 
answered, “There are seven metals belonging to the seven planets; and since 
Saturn is the Lord of lead, when lead is poured out over anyone who has been 
bewitched, it is his property to discover the witchcraft by his power. And 
so it has surely proved, and you will soon be cured; yet I must visit you 
for as many days as you have been under this spell.” And he asked me how 
many days had passed; and when I told him that was the third day, he came to 
see me on each of the next three days, and merely by examining and touching 
my foot and by saying over to himself certain words, he dissolved the charm 
and restored me to complete health.
        In this case it is clear that the healer is not a witch, although 
his method is something superstitious. For in that he promised a cure by the 
help of God, and not by devils' work, and that he alleged the influence of 
Saturn over lead, he was irreproachable and rather to be commended. But 
there remains some small doubt as to the power by which the witch's spell 
was removed, and the figures caused in the lead. For no witchcraft can be 
removed by any natural power, although it may be assuaged, as will be proved 
later where we speak of the remedies for those who are possessed: therefore 
it seems that he performed this cure by means of at least some tacit pact 
with a devil. And we call such a pact tacit when the practitioner agrees 
tacitly, at any rate, to employ the devil's aid. And in this way many 
superstitious works are done, but with a varying degree of offence to the 
Creator, since there may be far more offence to Him in one operation than in 
another.
        Yet because this peasant was certain of effecting a cure, and 
because he had to visit the patient for as many days as he had been ill, and 
although he used no natural remedies, yet cured him according to the promise 
made; for these reasons, although he had entered into no open pact with the 
devil, he is to be judged not only as a suspect, but as one plainly guilty 
of heresy, and must be considered as convicted and subject at least to the 
penalties set out below in the second method of sentencing; but his 
punishment must be accompanied with a solemn adjuration, unless he is 
protected by other laws which seem to be of a contrary intention; and what 
the Ordinary should do in such a case will be shown later in the solution of 
the arguments.
        The fourth class of remedies, concerning which the Canonists are in 
partial agreement with some of the Theologians, is said to be no worse than 
idle and vain; since it is superstitious only, and there is no pact either 
open or tacit with the devil as regards the intention or purpose of the 
practitioner. And I say that the Canonists and some Theologians are only 
partially agreed that this sort of remedy is to be tolerated; for their 
agreement or non-agreement depends upon whether or not they class this sort 
of remedies together with the third sort. But this sort of vain remedy is 
exemplified above in the case of the women who beat the pail hung over the 
fire in order that the witch may be beaten who has caused a cow to be 
drained of milk; although this may be done either in the name of the devil 
or without any reference to him.
        We may adduce other examples of the same kind. For sometimes when a 
cow has been injured in this way, and they wish to discover who has 
bewitched it, they drive it out into the fields with a man's trousers, or 
some unclean thing, upon its head or back. And this they do chiefly on Feast 
Days and Holy Days, and possibly with some sort of invocation of the devil; 
and they beat the cow with a stick and drive it away. Then the cow runs 
straight to the house of the witch, and beats vehemently upon the door with 
its horns, lowing loudly all the while; and the devil causes the cow to go 
on doing this until it is pacified by some other witchcraft.
        Actually, and according to the aforesaid Doctors, such remedies can 
be tolerated, but they are not meritorious, as some try to maintain. For S. 
Paul says that everything which we do, in word or deed, must be done in the 
name of Our Lord JESUS Christ. Now in this sort of remedy there may be no 
direct invocation of the devil, and yet the devil's name may be mentioned: 
and again there may be no intention to do such things by means of any open 
or tacit pact with the devil, yet a man may say, “I wish to do this, whether 
the devil has any part in it or not”; and that very temerity, by putting 
aside the fear of God, offends God, Who therefore grants the devil power to 
accomplish such cures. Therefore they who use such practices must be led 
into the way of penitence, and urged to leave such things and turn rather to 
the remedies of which we shall speak later, though we have touched upon them 
before, namely, the use of Holy Water and Blessed Salt and exorcisms, etc. 

        In the same light should be regarded those who use the following 
method. When an animal has been killed by witchcraft, and they wish to find 
out the witch, or to make certain whether its death was natural or due to 
witchcraft, they go to the place where dead animals are skinned, and drag 
the intestines along the ground up to their house; not into the house 
through the main door, but over the threshold of the back entrance into the 
kitchen; and then they make a fire and put the intestines over it on a 
hurdle. Then, according to what we have very often been told, just as the 
intestines get hot and burn, so are the intestines of the witch afflicted 
with burning pains. But when they perform this experiment they take great 
care that the door is securely locked; because the witch is compelled by her 
pains to try to enter the house, and if she can take a coal from the fire, 
all her pains will disappear. And we have often been told that, when she is 
unable to enter the house, she surrounds it inside and out with the densest 
fog, with such horrible shrieks and commotions that at last all those in the 
house think the roof is verily going to fall down and crush them unless they 
open the door.
        Certain other experiments are of the same nature. For sometimes 
people pick out the witches from a number of women in church by causing the 
witches to be unable to leave the church without their permission, even 
after the service is finished. And they do it in this way. On a Sunday they 
smear the shoes of the young men with grease, lard or pigs' fat, as is their 
wont when they wish to repair and renew the freshness of the leather, and 
thus the juvenals enter the church, whence it is impossible for any witches 
who are present to make their way out or depart until those who are anxious 
to espy them either go away themselves or give them express leave to make 
their way to their homes (see note).
        It is the same with certain words, which it is not expedient to 
mention lest anyone should be seduced by the devil to use them. For judges 
and magistrates should not attach too much weight to the evidence of those 
who pretend to discover witches by this means, for fear lest the devil, that 
wily enemy, should induce them under this pretext to defame innocent women. 
Therefore such persons must be enjoined to seek the remedy of penitence. 
However, practices of this kind are on occasion to be tolerated and allowed.
        In this way we have answered the arguments that no spell of 
witchcraft must be removed. For the first two remedies are altogether 
unlawful. The third remedy is tolerated by the law, but needs very careful 
examination on the part of the ecclesiastical judge. And what the civil law 
tolerates is shown in the chapter on witches, where it is said that those 
who have skill to prevent men's labours from being vitiated by tempests and 
hailstorms are worthy, not of punishment, but of reward. S. Antoninus also, 
in his Summa, points out this discrepancy between the Canon Law and civil 
law. Therefore it seems that the civil law concedes the legality of such 
practices for the preservation of crops and cattle, and that in any event 
certain men who use such arts are not only to be tolerated but even 
rewarded. Wherefore the ecclesiastical judge must take particular note 
whether the methods used in counteraction of hailstorms and tempests are 
within the spirit of the law, or whether they are in any way superstitious; 
and then, if no scandal to the Faith is involved, they can be tolerated. But 
actually this does not belong to the third method, but to the fourth, and 
also to the fifth, of which we shall speak later in the following chapters, 
where we deal with the ecclesiastical and lawful remedies, with which are 
sometimes included certain superstitious practices belonging to the fourth 
method. 




Chapter I  The Remedies prescribed by the Holy Church against Incubus and 
Succubus Devils.  

        IN the foregoing chapters on the First Question we have treated of 
the methods of bewitching men, animals and the fruits of the earth, and 
especially of the behaviour of witches in their own persons; how they seduce 
young girls in order to increase their numbers; what is their method of 
profession and of offering homage; how they offer to devils their own 
children and the children of others; and how they are transported from place 
to place. Now I say that there is no remedy for such practises, unless 
witches be entirely eradicated by the judges, or at least punished as an 
example to all who may wish to imitate them; but we are not immediately 
treating of this point, which will be dealt with in the last Part of this 
work, where we set forth the twenty ways of proceeding against and 
sentencing witches.
        For the present we are concerned only with the remedies against the 
injuries which they inflict; and first how men who are bewitched can be 
cured; secondly, beasts, and thirdly, how the fruits of the earth may be 
secured from blight or phylloxera.
        With regard to the bewitchment of human beings by means of Incubus 
and Succubus devils, it is to be noted that this can happen in three ways. 
First, when women voluntarily prostitute themselves to Incubus devils. 
Secondly, when men have connexion with Succubus devils; yet it does not 
appear that men thus devilishly fornicate with the same full degree of 
culpability; for men, being by nature intellectually stronger than women, 
are more apt to abhor such practises.
        There is in the town of Coblenz a poor man who is bewitched in this 
way. In the presence of his wife he is in the habit of acting after the 
manner of men with women, that is to say, of practising coition, as it were, 
and he continues to do this repeatedly, nor have the cries and urgent 
appeals of his wife any effect in making him desist. And after he has 
fornicated thus two or three times, he bawls out, “We are going to start all 
over again”; when actually there is no person visible to mortal sight lying 
with him. And after an incredible number of such bouts, the poor man at last 
sinks to the floor utterly exhausted. When he has recovered his strength a 
little and is asked how this happened to him, and whether he has had any 
women with him, he answers that he saw nothing, but his mind is in some way 
possessed so that he can by no means refrain from such priapism. And indeed 
he harbours a great suspicion that a certain woman bewitched him in this 
way, because he had offended her, and she had cursed him with threatening 
words, telling him what she would like to happen to him.
        But there are no laws or ministers of justice which can proceed to 
the avenging of so great a crime with no other warrant than a vague charge 
or a grave suspicion; for it is held that no one ought to be condemned 
unless he has been convicted by his own confession, or by the evidence of 
three trustworthy witnesses, since the mere fact of the crime coupled with 
even the gravest suspicions against some person is not sufficient to warrant 
the punishment of that person. But this matter will be dealt with later.
        As for instances where young maidens are molested by Incubus devils 
in this way, it would take too long to mention even those that have been 
known to happen in our own time, for there are very many well-attested 
stories of such bewitchments. But the great difficulty of finding a remedy 
for such afflictions can be illustrated from a story told by Thomas of 
Brabant in his Book on Bees.
        I saw, he writes, and heard the confession of a virgin in a 
religious habit, who said at first that she had never been a consenting 
party to fornication, but at the same time have been known in this way. This 
I could not believe, but narrowly charged and exhorted her, with the most 
solemn adjurations, to speak the truth on peril of her very soul. At last, 
weeping bitterly, she acknowledged that she had been corrupted rather in 
mind than in body; and that though she had afterwards grieved almost to 
death, and had daily confessed with tears, yet by no device or study or art 
could she be delivered from an Incubus devil, nor yet by the sign of the 
Cross, nor by Holy Water, which are specially ordained for the expulsion of 
devils, nor even by the Sacrament of the Body of Our Lord, which even the 
Angels fear. But at last after many years of prayer and fasting she was 
delivered.
        It may be believed (saving a better judgement) that, after she 
repented and confessed her sin, the Incubus devil should be regarded rather 
in the light of a punishment for sin than as a sin in itself.
        A devout nun, named Christina, in the Low Country of the Duchy of 
Brabant, told me the following concerning this same woman. On the vigil of 
one Pentacost the woman came to her complaining that she dared not take the 
Sacrament because of the importunate molestation of a devil. Christina, 
pitying her, said: “Go, and rest assured that you will receive the Body of 
Our Lord to-morrow; for I will take your punishment upon myself.” So she 
went away joyfully, and after praying the night slept in peace, and rose up 
in the morning and communicated in all tranquility of the soul. But 
Christina, not thinking of the punishment she had taken upon herself, went 
to her rest in the evening, and as she lay in bed hear, as it were, a 
violent attack being made upon her; and, seizing whatever it was by the 
throat, tried to throw it off. She lay down again, but was again molested, 
and rose up in terror; and this happened many times, whilst all the straw of 
her bed was turned over and thrown about everywhere, so at length she 
perceived that she was being persecuted by the malice of a devil. Thereupon 
she left her pallet, and passed a sleepless night; and when she wished to 
pray, she was so tormented by the devil that she said she had never suffered 
so much before. In the morning, therefore, saying to the other woman, “I 
renounce your punishment, and I am hardly alive to renounce it,” she escaped 
from the violence of that wicked tempter. From this it can be seen how 
difficult it is to cure this sort of evil, whether or not it is due to 
witchcraft.
        However, there are still some means by which these devils may be 
driven away, of which Nider writes in his Formicarius. He says that there 
are five ways by which girls or men can be delivered: first, by Sacramental 
Confession; second, by the Sacred Sign of the Cross, or by the recital of 
the Angelic Salutation; third, by the use of exorcisms; fourth, by moving to 
another place; and fifth, by means of excommunication prudently employed by 
holy men. It is evident from what has been said that the first two methods 
did not avail the nun; but they are not on that account to be neglected, for 
that which cures one person does not necessarily cure another, and 
conversely. And it is a recorded fact that Incubus devils have often been 
driven away by the Lord's Prayer, or by the sprinkling of Holy Water, and 
also especially by the Angelic Salutation.
        For S. Caesarius tells in his Dialogue that, after a certain priest 
had hanged himself, his concubine entered a convent, where she was carnally 
solicited by an Incubus. She drove him away by crossing herself and using 
Holy Water, yet he immediately returned. But when she recited the Angelic 
Salutation, he vanished like an arrow shot from a bow; still he came back, 
although he did not dare to come near her, because of the Ave MARIA.
        S. Caesarius also refers to the remedy of Sacramental Confession. 
For he says that the aforesaid concubine was entirely abandoned by the 
Incubus after she was clean confessed. He tells also of a man in Leyden who 
was plagued by a Succubus, and was entirely delivered after Sacramental 
Confession.
        He adds yet another example, of an enclosed nun, a contemplative, 
whom an Incubus would not leave in spite of prayers and confession and other 
religious exercises. For he persisted in forcing his way to her bed. But 
when, acting on the advice of a certain religious man, she uttered the word 
Benedicite, the devil at once left her.
        Of the fourth method, that of moving to another place, he says that 
a certain priest's daughter had been defiled by an Incubus and driven 
frantic with grief; but when she went away across the Rhine, she was left in 
peace by the Incubus. Her father, however, because he had sent her away, was 
so afflicted by the devil that he died within three days.
        He also maintains a woman who was often molested by an Incubus in 
her own bed, and asked a devout friend of hers to come and sleep with her. 
She did so, and was troubled all night with the utmost uneasiness and 
disquiet, and then the first woman was left in peace. William of Paris notes 
also that Incubus seem chiefly to molest women and girls with beautiful 
hair; either because they devote themselves too much to the care and 
adornment of their hair, or because they are boastfully vain about it, or 
because God in His goodness permits this so that women may be afraid to 
entice men by the very means by which the devils wish them to entice men.
        The fifth method, that of excommunication, which is perhaps the same 
as exorcism, is exemplified in a history of S. Bernard. In Aquitaine a woman 
had for six years been molested by an Incubus with incredible carnal abuse 
and lechery; and she heard the Incubus threaten her that she must not go 
near the holy man, who was coming that way, saying: “It will avail you 
nothing: for when he was gone away, I, who have till now been your lover, 
will become the cruellest of tyrants to you.” None the less she went to S. 
Bernard, and he said to her: “Take my staff and set it in your bed, and may 
the devil do what he can.” When she had done this, the devil did not dare to 
enter the woman's room, but threatened her terribly from outside, saying 
that he would persecute her when S. Bernard had gone away. When S. Bernard 
heard this from the woman, he called the people together, bidding them carry 
lighted candles in their hands, and, with the whole assembly which was 
gathered, excommunicated the devil, forbidding him evermore to approach that 
woman or any other. And so she was delivered from that punishment.
        Here it is to be noted that the power of the Keys granted to S. 
Peter and his successors, which resounds on the earth, is really a power of 
healing granted to the Church on behalf of travellers who are subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Papal power; therefore is seems wonderful that even the 
Powers of the air can be warded off by this virtue. But it must be 
remembered that persons who are molested by devils are under the 
jurisdiction of the Pope and his Keys; and therefore it is not surprising if 
such Powers are indirectly kept at bay by the virtue of the Keys, just as by 
the same virtue the souls in purgatory can indirectly by delivered from the 
pains of fire; insasmuch as this Power availeth upon the earth, ay, and to 
the relief of souls that are under the earth.
        But it is not seemly to discuss the Power of the Keys granted to the 
Head of the Church as Christ's Vicar; since it is know that, for the use of 
the Church, Christ granted to the Church and His Vicar as much power as it 
is possible for God to grant to mere man.
        And it is piously to be believed that, when infirmities inflicted by 
witches through the power of devils, together with the witches and devils 
themselves, are excommunicated, those who were afflicted will no longer be 
tormented; and that they will be delivered all the sooner by the use of 
other lawful exorcisms in addition.
        There is a common report current in the districts of the river 
Etsch, as also in other places, that by the permission of God a swarm of 
locusts came and devoured all the vines, green leaves and crops; and that 
they were suddenly put to flight and dispersed by means of this kind of 
excommunication and cursing. Now it any wish that this should ascribed to 
some holy man, and not to the virtue of the Keys, let ie be so, in the name 
of the Lord; but of one thing we are certain, that both the power to perform 
miracles and the power of the Keys necessarily presuppose a condition of 
grace in him who performs that act of grace, since both these powers proceed 
from grace granted to men who are in a state of grace.
        Again, it is to be noted that, if none of the aforesaid remedies are 
of any avail, then recourse must be had to the usual exorcisms, of which we 
shall treat later. And if even these are not sufficient to banish the 
iniquity of the devil, then that affliction must be considered to be an 
expiatory punishment for sin, which should be borne in all meekness, as are 
other ills of this sort which oppress us that they may, as it were, drive us 
to seek God.
        But it must also be remarked that sometimes persons only think they 
are molested by an Incubus when they are not so actually; and this is more 
apt to be the case with women than with men, for they are more timid and 
liable to imagine extraordinary things.
        In this connexion William of Paris is often quoted. He says: Many 
phantastical apparitions occur to person suffering fro a melancholy disease, 
especially to women, as is shown by their dreams and visions. And the reason 
for this, as physicians know, is that women's souls are by nature far more 
easily and lightly impressionable than men's souls. And he adds: I know that 
I have seen a woman who thought that a devil copulated with her from inside, 
and said she was physically conscious of such incredible things.
        At time also women think they have been made pregnant by an Incubus, 
and their bellies grow to an enormous size; but when the time of parturition 
comes, their swelling is relieved by no more than the expulsion of a great 
quantity of wind. For by taking ants' eggs in drink, or the seeds of spurge 
or of the black pine, an incredible amount of wind and flatulence is 
generated in the human stomach. And it is very easy for the devil to cause 
these and even greater disorders in the stomach. This has been set down in 
order that too easy credence should not be given to women, but only to those 
whom experience has shown to be trustworthy, and to those who, by sleeping 
in their beds or near them, know for a fact that such things as we have 
spoken of are true. 




Chapter II  Remedies prescribed for Those who are Bewitched by the 
Limitation of the Generative Power.  

        Although far more women are witches than men, as was shown in the 
First Part of the work, yet men are more often bewitched than women. And the 
reason for this lies in the fact that God allows the devil more power over 
the venereal act, by which the original sin is handed down, than over other 
human actions. In the same way He allows more witchcraft to be performed by 
means of serpents, which are more subject to incantations than other 
animals, because that was the first instrument of the devil. And the 
venereal act can be more readily and easily bewitched in a man than in a 
woman, as has been clearly shown. For there are five ways in which the devil 
can impede the act of generation, and they are more easily operated against 
men. 
        As far as possible we shall set out the remedies which can be 
applies in each separate kind of obstruction; and let him who is bewitched 
in this faculty take note to which class of obstruction he belongs. For 
there are five classes, according to Peter a Palude in his Fourth Book, 
dist. 34, of the trial of this sort of bewitchment. 
        For the devil, being a spirit, has by his very nature power, with 
God's permission, over a bodily creature, especially to promote or to 
prevent local motion. So by this power they can prevent the bodies of men 
and women from approaching each other; and this either directly or 
indirectly. Directly, when they remove one to a distance from another, and 
do not allow him to approach the other. Indirectly, when they cause some 
obstruction, or when they interpose themselves in an assumed body. So it 
happened that a young Pagan who had married an idol, but none the less 
contracted a marriage with a girl; but because of this he was unable to 
copulate with her, as has been shown above. 
        Secondly, the devil can inflame a man towards one woman and render 
him impotent towards another; and this he can secretly cause by the 
application of certain herbs or other matters of which he well knows the 
virtue for this purpose. 
        Thirdly, he can disturb the apperception of a man or a woman, so 
that he makes one appear hideous to the other; for, as has been shown, he 
can influence the imagination. 
        Fourthly, he can suppress the vigour of that member which is 
necessary for procreation; just as he can deprive any organ of the power of 
local motion. 
        Fifthly, he can prevent the flow of the semen to the members in 
which is the motive power, by as it were closing the seminal duct so that it 
does not descend to the genital vessels, or does not ascend again from them, 
or cannot come forth, or is spent vainly. 
        But if a man should say: I do not know by which of these different 
methods I have been bewitched; all I know is that I cannot do anything with 
my wife: he should be answered in this way. If he is active and able with 
regard to other women, but not with his wife, then he is bewitched in the 
second way; for he can be certified as to the first way, that he is being 
deluded by Succubus or Incubus devils. Moreover, if he does not find his 
wife repellent, and yet cannot know her, but can know other women, then 
again it is the second way; but if he finds her repellent and cannot 
copulate with her, then it is the second and the third way. If he does not 
find her repellent and wishes to have connexion with her, but has no power 
in his member, then it is the fourth way. But if he has power in his member, 
yet cannot emit his semen, then it is the fifth way. The method of curing 
these will be shown where we consider whether those who live in grace and 
those who do not are equally liable to be bewitched in these manners; and we 
answer that they are not, with the exception of the fourth manner, and even 
then very rarely. For such an affliction can happen to a man living in grace 
and righteousness; but the reader must understand that in this case we speak 
of the conjugal act between married people; for in any other case they are 
all liable to bewitchment; for every venereal act outside wedlock is a 
mortal sin, and is only committed by those who are not in a state of grace. 
        We have, indeed, the authority of the whole of Scriptural teaching 
that God allows the devil to afflict sinners more than the just. For 
although that most just man, Job, was stricken, yet he was not so 
particularly or directly in respect of the procreant function. And it may be 
said that, when a married couple are afflicted in this way, either both the 
parties or one of them is not living in a state of grace; and this opinion 
is substantiated in the Scriptures both by authority and by reason. For the 
Angel said to Tobias: The devil receives power against those who are given 
over to lust: and he proved it in the slaying of the seven husbands of the 
virgin Sara. 
        Cassian, in his Collation of the Fathers, quotes S. Antony as saying 
that the devil can in no way enter our mind or body unless he has first 
deprived it of all holy thoughts and made it empty and bare of spiritual 
contemplation. These words should not be applies to an evil affliction over 
the whole of the body, for when Job was so afflicted he was not denuded of 
Divine grace; but they have particular reference to a particular infirmity 
inflicted upon the body for some sin. And the infirmity we are considering 
can only be due to the sin of incontinence. For, as we have said, God allows 
the devil more power over that act than over other human acts, because of 
its natural nastiness, and because by it the first sin was handed down to 
posterity. Therefore when people joined in matrimony have for some sin been 
deprived of Divine help, God allows them to be bewitched chiefly in their 
procreant functions. 
        But if it is asked of what sort are those sins, it can be said, 
according to S. Jerome, that even in a state of matrimony it is possible to 
commit the sin of incontinence in various ways. See the text: He who loves 
his wife to excess is an adulterer. And they who love in this way are more 
liable to be bewitched after the manner we have said. 
        The remedies of the Church, then, are twofold: one applicable in the 
public court, the other in the tribunal of the confessional. As for the 
first, when it has been publicly found that the impotence is due to 
witchcraft, then it must be distinguished whether it is temporary or 
permanent. If it is only temporary, it does not annul the marriage. And it 
is assumed to be temporary if, within the space of three years, by using 
every possible expedient of the Sacraments of the Church and other remedies, 
a cure can be caused. But if, after that time, they cannot be cured by any 
remedy, then it is assumed to be permanent. 
        Now the disability either precedes both the contract and the 
consummation of marriage; and in this case it impedes the contract: or it 
follows the contract but precedes the consummation; and in this case it 
annuls the contract. For men are very often bewitched in this way because 
they have cast off their former mistresses, who, hoping that they were to be 
married and being disappointed, so bewitch the men that they cannot copulate 
with another woman. And in such a case, according to the opinion of many, 
the marriage already contracted is annulled, unless, like Our Blessed Lady 
and S. Joseph they are willing to live together in holy continence. This 
opinion is supported by the Canon where it says (23, q. I) that a marriage 
is confirmed by the carnal act. And a little later it says that impotence 
before such confirmation dissolves the ties of marriage. 
        Or else the disability follows the consummation of a marriage, and 
then it does not dissolve the bonds of matrimony. Much more to this effect 
is noted by the Doctors, where in various writings they treat of the 
obstruction due to witchcraft; but since it is not precisely relevant to the 
present inquiry, it is here omitted. 
        But some may find it difficult to understand how this function can 
be obstructed in respect of one woman but not of another. S. Bonaventura 
answers that this may be because some witch has persuaded the devil to 
effect this only with respect to one woman, or because God will not allow 
the obstruction to apply save to some particular woman. The judgement of God 
in this matter is a mystery, as in the case of the wife of Tobias. But how 
the devil procures this disability is plainly shown by what has already been 
said. And S. Bonaventura says that he obstructs the procreant function, not 
intrinsically by harming the organ, but extrinsically by impeding its use; 
and it is an artificial, not a natural impediment; and so he an cause it to 
apply to one woman and not to another. Or else he takes away all desire for 
one or another woman; and this he does by his own power, or else by means of 
some herb or stone or some occult creature. And in this he is in substantial 
agreement with Peter a Palude. 
        The ecclesiastical remedy in the tribunal of God is set forth in the 
Canon where it says: If with the permission of the just and secret judgement 
of God, through the arts of sorceresses and witches and the preparation of 
the devil, men are bewitched in their procreant function, they are to be 
urged to make clean confession to God and His priest of all their sins with 
a contrite heart and a humble spirit; and to make satisfaction to God with 
many tears and large offerings and prayers and fasting. 
        From these words it is clear that such afflictions are only on 
account of sin, and occur only to those who do not live in a state of grace. 
It proceeds to tell how the ministers of the Church can effect a cure by 
means of exorcisms and the other protections and cures provided by the 
Church. In this way, with the help of God, Abraham cured by his prayers 
Abimelech and his house. 
        In conclusion we may say that there are five remedies which may 
lawfully be applied to those who are bewitched in this way: namely, a 
pilgrimage to some holy and venerable shrine; true confession of their sins 
with contrition; the plentiful use of the sign of the Cross and devout 
prayer; lawful exorcism by solemn words, the nature of which will be 
explained later; and lastly, a remedy can be effected by prudently 
approaching the witch, as was shown in the case of the Count who for three 
years was unable to cohabit carnally with a virgin whom he had married. 




Chapter III  Remedies prescribed for those who are Bewitched by being 
Inflamed with Inordinate Love or Extraordinary Hatred.  

        JUST as the generative faculty can be bewitched, so can inordinate 
love or hatred be caused in the human mind. First we shall consider the 
cause of this, and then, as far as possible, the remedies.
        Philocaption, or inordinate love of one person for another, can be 
caused in three ways. Sometimes it is due merely to a lack of control over 
the eyes; sometimes to the temptation of devils; sometimes to the spells of 
necromancers and witches, with the help of devils.
        The first is spoken of in S. James i. 14, 15: Every man is tempted 
by his own concupiscence, being drawn away and allured. Then when 
concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: but sin, when it is 
completed, begetteth death. And so, when Shecham saw Dinah going out to see 
the daughters of the land, he loved her, and ravished her, and lay with her, 
and his soul clave unto her (Genesis xxxiv). And here the gloss says that 
this happened to an infirm spirit because she left her own concerns to 
inquire into those of other people; and such a soul is seduced by bad 
habits, and is led to consent to unlawful practices.
        The second cause arises from the temptation of devils. In this way 
Amnon loved his beautiful sister Tamar, and was so vexed that he fell sick 
for love of her (II. Samuel xiii). For he could not have been so totally 
corrupt in his mind as to fall into so great a crime of incest unless he had 
been grievously tempted by the devil. The book of the Holy Fathers refers to 
this kind of love, where it says that even in their hermitages they were 
exposed to every temptation, including that of carnal desires; for some of 
them were at times tempted with the love of women more than it is possible 
to believe. S. Paul also says, in II. Corinthians xii: There was given to me 
a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me: and the gloss 
explains this as referring to the temptation of lust.
        But it is said that when a man does not give way to temptation he 
does not sin, but it is an exercise for his virtue; but this is to be 
understood of the temptation of the devil, not of that of the flesh; for 
this is a venial sin even if a man does not yield to it. Many examples of 
this are to be read.
        As for the third cause, by which inordinate love proceeds from 
devils' and witches' works, the possibility of this sort of witchcraft has 
been exhaustively considered in the Questions of the First Part as to 
whether devils through the agency of witches can turn the minds of men to 
inordinate love or hatred, and it was proved by examples which had fallen 
within our own experience. Indeed this is the best known and most general 
form of witchcraft.
        But the following question may be asked: Peter has been seized with 
an inordinate love of this description, but he does not know whether it is 
due to the first or the second or the third cause. It must be answered that 
it can be by the work of the devil that hatred is stirred up between married 
people so as to cause the crime of adultery. But when a man is so bound in 
the meshes of carnal lust and desire that he can be made to desist from it 
by no shame, words, blows or action; and when a man often puts away his 
beautiful wife to cleave to the most hideous of women, and when he cannot 
rest in the night, but is so demented that he must go by devious ways to his 
mistress; and when it is found that those of noblest birth, Governors, and 
other rich men, are the most miserably involved in this sin (for this age is 
dominated by women, and was foretold by S. Hildegard, as Vincent of Beauvais 
records in the Mirror of History, although he said it would note endure for 
as long as it already has); and when the world is now full of adultery, 
especially among the most highly born; when all this is considered, I say, 
of what use is it to speak of remedies to those who desire no remedy? 
Nevertheless, for the satisfaction of the pious reader, we will set down 
briefly some of the remedies for Philocaption when it is not due to 
witchcraft.
        Avicenna mentions seven remedies which may be used when a man is 
made physically ill by this sort of love; but they are hardly relevant to 
our inquiry except in so far as they may be of service to the sickness of 
the soul. For he says, in Book III, that the root of the sickness may be 
discovered by feeling the pulse and uttering the name of the object of the 
patient's love; and then, if the law permits, he may be cured by yielding to 
nature. Or certain medicines may be applied, concerning which he gives 
instructions. Or the sick man may be turned from his love by lawful remedies 
which will cause him to direct his love to a more worthy object. Or he may 
avoid her presence, and so distract his mind from her. Or, if he is open to 
correction, he may be admonished and expostulated with, to the effect that 
such love is the greatest misery. Or he may be directed to someone who, as 
far as he may with God's truth, will vilify the body and disposition of his 
love, and so blacken her character that she may appear to him altogether 
base and deformed. Or, finally, he is to be set to arduous duties which may 
distract his thoughts.
        Indeed, just as the animal nature of man may be cured by such 
remedies, so may they all be of use in reforming his inner spirit. Let a man 
obey the law of his intellect rather than that of nature, let him turn his 
love to safe pleasures, let him remember how momentary is the fruition of 
lust and how eternal the punishment, let him seek his pleasure in that life 
where joys begin never to end, and let him consider that if he cleaves to 
this earthly love, that will be his sole reward, but he will lose the bliss 
of Heaven, and be condemned to eternal fire: behold! the three irrevocable 
losses which proceed from inordinate lust.
        With regard to Philocaption caused by witchcraft, the remedies 
detailed in the preceding chapter may not inconveniently be applied here 
also; especially the exorcisms by sacred words which the bewitched person 
can himself use. Let him daily invoke the Guardian Angel deputed to him by 
God, let him use confession and frequent the shrines of the Saints, 
especially of the Blessed Virgin, and without doubt he will be delivered.
        But how abject are those strong men who, discarding their natural 
gifts and the armour of virtue, cease to defend themselves; whereas the 
girls themselves in their invincible frailty use those very rejected weapons 
to repel this kind of witchcraft. We give one out of many examples in their 
praise.
        There was in a country village near Lindau in the diocese of 
Constance a grown maid fair to see and of even more elegant behaviour, at 
sight of whom a certain man of loose principles, a cleric in sooth, but not 
a priest, was smitten with violent pangs of love. And being unable to 
conceal the wound in his heart any longer, he went to the place where the 
girl was working, and with fair words showed that he was in the net of the 
devil, beginning by venturing in words only to persuade the girl to grant 
him her love. She, perceiving by Divine instinct his meaning, and being 
chaste in mind and body, bravely answered him: Master, do not come to my 
house with such words, for modesty itself forbids. To this he replied: 
Although you will not be persuaded by gentle words to love me, yet I promise 
you that soon you will be compelled by my deeds to love me. Now that man was 
a suspected enchanter and wizard. The maiden considered his words as but 
empty air, and until then felt in herself no spark of carnal love for him; 
but after a short time she began to have amorous thoughts. Perceiving this, 
and being inspired by God, she sought the protection of the Mother of Mercy, 
and devoutly implored Her to intercede with Her Son to help her. Anxious, 
moreover, she went on a pilgrimage to a hermitage, where there was a church 
miraculously consecrated in that diocese to the Mother of God. There she 
confessed her sins, so that no evil spirit could enter her, and after her 
prayers to the Mother of Pity all the devil's machinations against her 
ceased, so that these evil crafts thenceforth never afflicted her.
        None the less there are still some strong men cruelly enticed by 
witches to this sort of love, so that it would seem that they could never 
restrain themselves from their inordinate lust for them, yet these often 
most manfully resist the temptation of lewd and filthy enticements, and by 
the aforesaid defences overcome all the wiles of the devil.
        A rich young man in the town of Innsbruck provides us with a notable 
pattern of this sort of struggle. He was so importuned by witches that it is 
hardly possible for pen to describe his strivings, but he always kept a 
brave heart, and escaped by means of the remedies we have mentioned. 
Therefore it may justly be concluded that these remedies are infallible 
against this disease, and that they who use such weapons will most surely be 
delivered.
        And it must be understood that what we have said concerning 
inordinate love applies also to inordinate hatred, since the same discipline 
is of benefit for the two opposite extremes. But though the degree of 
witchcraft is equal in each, yet there is this difference in the case of 
hatred; the person who is hated must seek another remedy. For the man who 
hates his wife and puts her out of his heart will not easily, if he is an 
adulterer, be turned back again to his wife, even though he go on many a 
pilgrimage.
        Now it has been learned from witches that they cause this spell of 
hatred by means of serpents; for the serpent was the first instrument of the 
devil, and by reason of its curse inherits a hatred of women; therefore they 
cause such spells by placing the skin or head of a serpent under the 
threshold of a room or house. For this reason all the nooks and corners of 
the house where such a woman lives are to be closely examined and 
reconstructed as far as possible; or else she must be lodged in the houses 
of others.
        And when it is said the bewitched men can exorcise themselves, it is 
to be understood that they can wear the sacred words or benedictions of 
incantations round their necks, if they are unable to read or pronounce the 
benedictions; but it will be shown later in what way this should be done. 




Chapter IV  Remedies presribed for those who by Prestidigitative Art have 
lost their Virile Members or have seemingly been Transformed into the Shapes 
of Beasts.  

        In what has already been written it has clearly enough been shown 
the remedies which are available for the relief of those who are deluded by 
a glamour, and think that they have lost their virile member, or have been 
metamorphosed into animals. For since such men are entirely destitute of 
Divine grace, according to the essential condition of those who are so 
bewitched, it is not possible to apply a healing salve while the weapon 
still remains in the wound. Therefore before all things they must be 
reconciled to God by a good confession. Again, as was shown in the seventh 
chapter of the First Question of the Second Part, such members are never 
actually taken away from the body, but are only hidden by a glamour from the 
senses of sight and touch. It is clear, too, that those who live in grace 
are not so easily deluded in this way, either actively or passively, in such 
a manner, that is, that they seem to lose their members, or that those of 
others should appear to them to be missing. Therefore the remedy as well as 
the disease is explained in that chapter, namely, that they should as far as 
possible come to an amicable agreement with the witch herself. 
        As to those who think that they have been changed into beasts, it 
must be known that this kind of witchcraft is more practised in Easter 
countries than in the West; that is to say, in the East witches more often 
bewitch other people in this way, but it appears that the witches so 
transform themselves more frequently in our part of the world; namely, when 
they change themselves, in full sight, into the shapes of animals, as was 
told in the eighth chapter. Therefore in their case the remedies to be used 
are those set out in the Third Part of this work, where we deal with the 
extermination of witches by the secular arm of the law. 
        But in the East the following remedy is used for such delusions. For 
we have learned much of this matter from the Knights of the Order of S. John 
of Jerusalem in Rhodes; and especially this case which happened in the city 
of Salamis in the kingdom of Cyprus. For that is a seaport, and once when a 
vessel was being laden with merchandise suitable for a ship which is sailing 
into foreign parts, and all her company were providing themselves with 
victuals, one of them, a strong young man, went to the house of a woman 
standing outside the city on the seashore, and asked her if she had any eggs 
to sell. The woman, seeing that he was a strong young man, and a merchant 
far away from his own country, thought that on that account the people of 
the city would feel less suspicion if he were to be lost, and said to him: 
“Wait a little, and I will get you all that you want.” And when she went in 
and shut the door and kept him waiting, the young man outside began to call 
out to her to hurry, lest he should miss the ship. Then the woman brought 
some eggs and gave them to the young man, and told him to hurry back tot he 
ship in case he should miss it. So he hastened back to the ship, which was 
anchored by the shore, and before going on board, since the full company of 
his companions was not yet returned, he decided to eat the eggs there and 
refresh himself. And behold! an hour later he was made dumb as if he had no 
power of speech; and, as he afterwards said, he wondered what could have 
happened to him, but was unable to find out. Yet when he wished to go on 
board, he was driven off with sticks by those who yet remained ashore, and 
who all cried out: “Look what this ass is doing! Curse the beast, you are 
not coming on board.” The young man being thus driven away, and 
understanding from their words that they thought he was an ass, reflected 
and began to suspect that he had been bewitched by the woman, especially 
since he could utter no word, although he understood all that was said. And 
when, on again trying to board the ship, he was driven off with heavier 
blows, he was in bitterness of heart compelled to remain and watch the ship 
sail away. And so, as he ran here and there, since everybody thought he was 
an ass, he was necessarily treated as such. At last, under compulsion, he 
went back to the woman’s house, and to keep himself alive served her at her 
pleasure for three years, doing no work but to bring to the house such 
necessities as wood and corn, and to carry away what had to be carried away 
like a beast of burden: the only consolation that was left to him being that 
although everyone else took him for an ass, the witches themselves, 
severally and in company, who frequented the house, recognized him as a man, 
and he could talk and behave with them as a man should. 
        Now if it is asked how burdens were placed upon him as if he were a 
beast, we must say that this case is analogous to that of which S. Augustine 
speaks in his De Ciuitate Dei, Book XVIII, chapter 17, where he tells of the 
tavern women who changed their guests into beasts of burden; and to that of 
the father Praestantius, who thought he was a pack-horse and carried corn 
with other animals. For the delusion caused by this glamour was threefold. 
        First in its effect on the men who saw the young man not as a man 
but as an ass; and it is shown above in Chapter VIII how devils can easily 
cause this. Secondly, those burdens were no illusion; abut when they were 
beyond the strength of the young man, the devil invisible carried them. 
Thirdly, that when he was consorting with others, the young man himself 
considered in his imagination and perceptive faculties at least, which are 
faculties belonging to the bodily organs, that he was an ass; but not in his 
reason: for he as not so bound but that he knew himself to be a man, 
although he was magically deluded into imagining himself a beast. 
Nabuchodonosor provides an example of the same delusion. 
        After three years had passed in this way, in the fourth year it 
happened that the young man went one morning into the city, with the woman 
following a long way behind; and he passed by a church where Holy Mass was 
being celebrated, and heard the sacred-bell ring at the elevation of the 
Host (for in that kingdom the Mass is celebrated according to the Latin, and 
not according to the Greek rite). And he turned towards the church, and, not 
daring to enter for fear of being driven off with blows, knelt down outside 
by bending the knees of his hind legs, and lifted his forelegs, that is, his 
hands, joined together over his ass’s head, as it was thought to be, and 
looked upon the elevation of the Sacrament. And when some Genoese merchants 
saw this prodigy, they followed the ass in astonishment, discussing this 
marvel among themselves; and behold! the witch came and belaboured the ass 
with her stick. And because, as we have said, this sort of witchcraft is 
better known in those parts, at the instance of the merchants the ass and 
the witch were taken before the judge; where, being questioned and tortured, 
she confessed her crime and promised to restore the young man to his true 
shape if she might be allowed to return to her house. So she was dismissed 
and went back to her house, where the young man was restored to his former 
shape; and being again arrested, she paid the debt which her crimes merited. 
And the young man returned joyfully to his own country. 




Chapter V  Prescribed Remedies for those who are Obsessed owing to some 
Spell.  

        We have shown in Chapter X of the preceding Question that sometimes 
devils, through witchcraft, substantially inhabit certain men, and why they 
do this: namely, that it may be for some grave crime of the man himself, and 
for his own ultimate benefit; or sometimes for the slight fault of another 
man; sometimes for a man's own venial sin; and sometimes for another man's 
grave sin. For any of these reasons a man may in varying degrees be 
possessed by a devil. Nider in his Formicarius states that there is no cause 
for wonder if devils, at the instance of witches and with God's permission, 
substantially take possession of men.
        It is clear also from the details given in that chapter what are the 
remedies by which such men can be liberated; namely, by the exorcisms of the 
Church; and by true contrition and confession, when a man is possessed for 
some mortal sin. An example is the manner in which that Bohemian priest was 
set free. But there are three other remedies besides, which are of virtue; 
namely, the Holy Communion of the Eucharist, the visitation of shrines and 
the prayers of holy men, and by lifting the sentence of excommunication. Of 
these we shall speak, although they are plainly set out in the discourses of 
the Doctors, since all have not easy access to the necessary treatises.
        Cassian, in his Collation of the Abbots, speaks in these words of 
the Eucharist: We do not remember that our elders ever forbade the 
administration of the Holy Communion to those possessed by evil spirits; it 
should even be given to them every day if possible. For it must be believed 
that It is of great virtue in the purgation and protection of both soul and 
body; and that when a man receives It, the evil spirit which afflicts his 
members or lurks hidden in them is driven away as if it were burned with 
fire. And lately we saw the Abbot Andronicus healed in this way; and the 
devil will rage with mad fury when he feels himself shut out by the heavenly 
medicine, and he will try the harder and the oftener to inflict his 
tortures, as he feels himself driven farther off by this spiritual remedy. 
So says S. John Cassian.
        And again he adds: Two things must be steadfastly believed. First, 
that without the permission of God no one is altogether possessed by these 
spirits. Second, that everything which God permits to happen to us, whether 
it seem to be sorrow or gladness, is sent for out good as from a pitying 
Father and merciful Physician. For the devils are, as it were, schoolmasters 
of humility, so that they who descend from this world may either be purged 
for the eternal life or be sentenced to the pain of their punishment; and 
such, according to S. Paul, are in the present life delivered unto Satan for 
the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the 
Lord Jesus Christ.
        But here there arises a doubt. For S. Paul says: Let a man examine 
himself, and so eat of the Bread: then how can a man who is possessed 
communicate, since he has not the use of his reason? S. Thomas answers this 
in his Third Part, Question 80, saying that there are distinct degrees in 
madness. For to say that a man has not the use of his reason may mean two 
things. In one case he has some feeble power of reason; as a man is said to 
be blind when he can nevertheless see imperfectly. And since such men can to 
some extent join in the devotion of this Sacrament, it is not to be denied 
to them.
        But others are said to be mad because they have been so from birth; 
and such may not partake of the Sacrament, since they are in no way able to 
engage in devout preparation for it.
        Or perhaps they have not always been without the use of their 
reason; and then, if when they were sane they appeared to appreciate the 
devotion due to the Sacrament, It should be administered to them when they 
are at the point of death, unless it is feared that they may vomit or spew 
It out.
        The following decision is recorded by the Council of Carthage (26, 
q. 6). When a sick man wishes to confess, and if on the arrival of the 
priest he is rendered dumb by his infirmity, or falls into a frenzy, those 
who have heard him speak must give their testimony. And if he is thought to 
be at the point of death, let him be reconciled with God by the laying on of 
hands and the placing of the Sacrament in his mouth. S. Thomas also says 
that the same procedure may be used with baptized people who are bodily 
tormented by unclean spirits, and with other mentally distracted persons. 
And he adds, in Book IV, dist. 9, that the Communion must not be denied to 
demoniacs unless it is certain that they are being tortured by the devil for 
some crime. To this Peter of Palude adds: In this case they are to be 
considered as persons to be excommunicated and delivered up to Satan.
        From this it is clear that, even if a man be possessed by a devil 
for his own crimes, yet if he has lucid intervals and, while he has the use 
of his reason, is contrite and confesses his sins, since he is absolved in 
the sight of God, he must in no way be deprived of the Communion of the 
Divine Sacrament of the Eucharist.
        How those who are possessed may be delivered by the intercessions 
and prayers of the Saints is found in the Legends of the Saints. For by the 
merits of Saints, Martyrs, Confessors and Virgins the unclean spirits are 
subdued by their prayers in the land where they live, just as the Saints in 
their earthly journey subdued them.
        Likewise we read that the devout prayers of wayfarers have often 
obtained the deliverance of those possessed. And Cassian urges them to pray 
for them, saying: If we hold the opinion or rather faith of which I have 
written above, that everything is sent by the Lord for the good of our souls 
and the betterment of the universe, we shall in no way despise those who are 
possessed; but we shall incessantly pray for them as for our own selves, and 
pity them with our whole heart.
        As for the last method, that of releasing the sufferer from 
excommunication, it must be known that this is rare, and only lawfully 
practised by such as have authority and are informed by revelation that the 
man has become possessed on account of the excommunication of the Church: 
such was the case of the Corinthian fornicator (I. Corinthians v) who was 
excommunicated by S. Paul and the Church, and delivered unto Satan for the 
destruction of the flesh, that his spirit might be saved in the day of our 
Lord JESUS Christ; that is, as the gloss says, either for the illumination 
of grace by contrition or for judgement.
        And he delivered to Satan false teachers who had lost the faith, 
such as Hymenaeus and Alexander, that they might learn not to blaspheme (I. 
Timothy i). For so great was the power and the grace of S. Paul, says the 
gloss, that by the mere words of his mouth he could deliver to Satan those 
who fell away from the faith.
        S. Thomas (IV. 18) teaches concerning the three effects of 
excommunication as follows. If a man, he says, is deprived of the prayers of 
the Church, he suffers a threefold loss corresponding with the benefits 
which accrue to one who is in communion with the Church. For those who are 
excommunicated are bereft of the source from which flows an increase of 
grace to those who have it, and a mean to obtain grace for those who have it 
not; and, being deprived of grace, they lose also the power of preserving 
their uprightness; although it must not be thought that they are altogether 
shut out from God's providence, but only from that special providence which 
watches over the sons of the Church; and they lose also a strong source of 
protection against the Enemy, for greater power is granted to the devil to 
injure such men, both bodily and spiritually.
        For in the primitive Church, when men had to be drawn into the faith 
by signs, just as the Holy Spirit was made manifest by a visible sign, so 
also a bodily affliction by the devil was the visible sign of a man who was 
excommunicated. And it is not unfitting that a man whose case is not quite 
desperate should be delivered to Satan; for he is not given to the devil as 
one to be damned, but to be corrected, since it is in the power of the 
Church, when she pleases, to deliver him again from the hands of the devil. 
So says S. Thomas. Therefore the lifting of the ban of excommunication, when 
prudently used by a discreet exorcist, is a fitting remedy for those who are 
possessed.
        But Nider adds that the exorcist must particularly beware of making 
too presumptive a use of his powers, or of mingling any ribaldry or jesting 
with the serious work of God, or adding to it anything that smacks of 
superstition or witchcraft; for otherwise he will hardly escape punishment, 
as he shows by an example.
        For Blessed Gregory, in his First Dialogue, tells of a certain woman 
who, against her conscience, yielded to her husband's persuasions to take 
pare in the ceremonies at the vigil of the dedication of the Church of S. 
Sebastian. And because she joined in the Church's procession against her 
conscience, she became possessed and raged publicly. When the priest of that 
church saw this, he took the cloth from the altar and covered her with it; 
and the devil suddenly entered into the priest. And because he had presumed 
beyond his strength, he was constrained by his torments to reveal who he 
was. So says S. Gregory.
        And to show that no spirit of ribaldry must be allowed to enter into 
the holy office of exorcism, Nider tells that he saw in a monastery at 
Cologne a brother who was given to speaking jestingly, but was a very famous 
expeller of devils. This man was casting a devil out of a man possessed in 
the monastery, and the devil asked him to give him some place to which he 
could go. This pleased the Brother, and he jokingly said, “Go to my privy.” 
So the devil went out; and when in the night the Brother wished to go and 
purge his belly, the devil attacked him so savagely in the privy that he 
with difficulty escaped with his life.
        But especial care is to be taken that those who are obsessed through 
witchcraft should not be induced to go to witches to be healed. For S. 
Gregory goes on to say of the woman we have just mentioned: Her kindred and 
those who loved her in the flesh took her to some witches to be healed, by 
whom she was taken to a river and dipped in the water with many incantation; 
and upon this she was violently shaken, and instead of one devil being cast 
out, a legion entered into her, and she began to cry out in their several 
voices. Therefore her kindred confessed what they had done, and in great 
grief brought her to the holy Bishop Fortunatus, who by daily prayers and 
fasting entirely restored her to health.
        But since it has been said that exorcists must beware lest they make 
use of anything savouring of superstition or witchcraft, some exorcist may 
doubt whether it is lawful to use certain unconsecrated herbs and stones. In 
answer we say that it is so much the better if the herbs are consecrated; 
but that if they are not, then it is not superstitious to use a certain herb 
called Demonifuge, or even the natural properties of stones. But he must not 
think that he is casting out devils by the power of these; for then he would 
fall into the error of believing that he could use other herbs and 
incantations in the same way; and this is the error of necromancers, who 
think that they can perform this kind of work through the natural and 
unknown virtues of such objects.
        Therefore S. Thomas says, Book IV. dist. 7, art. the last: It must 
not be any corporeal powers; and therefore they are not to be influenced by 
invocations or any acts of sorcery, except in so far as they have entered 
into a pact with a witch. Of this Esaias (xxviii) speaks: We have made a 
covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement. And he thus explains 
the passage in Job xli: Canst thou draw out Leviathan with an hook? and the 
following words. For he says: If one rightly considers all that has been 
said before, it will seem that it belongs to the heretical presumption of 
necromancers when anyone tries to make an agreement with devils, or to 
subject them in any way to his own will.
        Having, then, shown that man cannot of his own power overcome the 
devil, he concludes by saying: Place your hand upon him; but understand 
that, if you have any power, it is yet by Divine virtue that he is overcome. 
And he adds: Remember the battle which I wage against him; that is to say, 
the present being put for the future, I shall fight against him on the 
Cross, where Leviathan will be taken with an hook, that is, by the divinity 
hidden under the bait of humanity, since he will think our Saviour to be 
only a man. And afterwards it says: There is no power on earth to be 
compared with him: by which it is meant that no bodily power can equal the 
power of the devil, which is a purely spiritual power. So says S. Thomas.
        But a man possessed by a devil can indirectly be relieved by the 
power of music, as was Saul by David's harp, or of a herb, or of any other 
bodily matter in which there lies some natural virtue. Therefore such 
remedies may be used, as can be argued both from authority and by reason. 
For S. Thomas, XXVI. 7, says that stones and herbs may be used for the 
relief of a man possessed by a devil. And there are the words of S. Jerome.
        And as for the passage in Tobias, where the Angel says: Touching the 
heart and the liver (which you took from the fish), if a devil or an evil 
spirit trouble any, we must make a smoke thereof before the man or the 
woman, and the party shall be no more vexed; S. Thomas says: We ought not to 
marvel at this, for the smoke of a certain tree when it is burned seems to 
have the same virtue, as if it has in it some spiritual sense, or power of 
spiritual prayer for the future.
        Of the same opinion are Blessed Albert, in his commentary on S. Luke 
ix, and Nicolas of Lyra and Paul of Burgos, on I. Samuel xvi. The last-named 
homilist comes to this conclusion: that it must be allowed that those 
possessed by a devil can not only be relieved, but even entirely delivered 
by means of material things, understanding that in the latter case they are 
not very fiercely molested. And he proves this by reasoning as follows: 
Devils cannot alter corporeal matter just at their will, but only by 
bringing together complementary active and passive agents, as Nicolas says. 
In the same way some material object can cause in the human body a 
disposition which makes it susceptible to the operations of the devil. For 
example, according to physicians, mania very much predisposes a man to 
dementia, and consequently to demoniac obsession: therefore if, in such a 
case, the predisposing passive agent be remove, it will follow that the 
active affliction of the devil will be cured.
        In this light we may consider the fish's liver; and the music of 
David, by which Saul was at first relieved and then entirely delivered of 
the evil spirit; for it says: And the evil spirit departed from him. But it 
is not consonant with the meaning of the Scripture to say that this was done 
by the merits or prayers of David; for the Scripture says nothing of any 
such matter, whereas it would have spoken notably in his praise if this had 
been so. This reasoning we take fro Paul of Burgos. There is also the reason 
which we gave in Question V of the First Part: that Saul was liberated 
because by the harp was prefigured the virtue of the Cross on which were 
stretched the Sacred Limbs of Christ's Body. And more is written there which 
may be considered together with the present inquiry. But we shall only 
conclude by saying that the use of material things in lawful exorcisms is 
not superstitious. And now it is expedient that we should speak about the 
exorcisms themselves. 




Chapter VI  Prescribed Remedies; to wit, the Lawful Exorcisms of the Church, 
for all Sorts of Infirmities and Ills due to Witchcraft; and the Method of 
Exorcising those who are Bewitched.  

        It has already been stated that witches can afflict men with every 
kind of physical infirmity; therefore it can be taken as a general rule that 
the various verbal or practical remedies which can be applied in the case of 
those infirmities which we have just been discussing are equally applicable 
to all other infirmities, such as epilepsy or leprosy, for example. And as 
lawful exorcisms are reckoned among the verbal remedies and have been most 
often considered by us, they may be taken as a general type of such 
remedies; and there are three matters to be considered regarding them.
        First, we must judge whether a person who has not been ordained as 
an exorcist, such as a layman or a secular cleric, may lawfully exorcise 
devils and their works. Bound up with this question are three others: 
namely; first, what constitutes the legality of this practice; secondly, the 
seven conditions which must be observed when one wishes to make private use 
of charms and benedictions; and thirdly, in what way the disease is to be 
exorcised and the devil conjured.
        Secondly, we must consider what is to be done when no healing grace 
results from the exorcism.
        Thirdly, we must consider practical and not verbal remedies; 
together with the solution of certain arguments.
        For the first, we have the opinion of S. Thomas in Book IV, dist. 
23. He says: When a man is ordained as an exorcist, or into any of the other 
minor Orders, he has conferred upon him the power of exorcism in his 
official capacity; and this power may even lawfully be used by those who 
belong to no Order, but such do not exercise it in their official capacity. 
Similarly the Mass can be said in an unconsecrated house, although the very 
purpose of consecrating a church is that the Mass may be said there; but 
this is more on account of the grace which is in the righteous than of the 
grace of the Sacrament.
        From these words we may conclude that, although it is good that in 
the liberation of a bewitched person recourse should be had to an exorcist 
having authority to exorcise such bewitchments, yet at times other devout 
persons may, either with or without any exorcism, cast out this sort of 
diseases.
        For we hear of a certain poor and very devout virgin, one of whose 
friends has been grievously bewitched in his foot, so that it was clear to 
the physicians that he could be cured by no medicines. But it happened that 
the virgin went to visit the sick man, and he at once begged her to apply 
some benediction to his foot. She consented, and did no more than silently 
say the Lord's Prayer and the Apostles' Creed, at the same time making use 
of the sign of the life-giving Cross. The sick man then felt himself at once 
cured, and, that he might have a remedy for the future, asked the virgin 
what charms she had used. But she answered: You are of little faith and do 
not hold to the holy and lawful practices of the Church, and you often apply 
forbidden charms and remedies for your infirmities; therefore you are rarely 
healthy in your body, because you are always sick in your soul. But if you 
would put your trust in prayer and in the efficacy of lawful symbols, you 
will often be very easily cured. For I did nothing but repeat the Lord's 
Prayer and the Apostles' Creed, and you are now cured.
        This example gives rise to the question, whether there is not any 
efficacy in other benedictions and charms, and even conjurations by way of 
exorcism; for they seem to be condemned in this story. We answer that the 
virgin condemned only unlawful charms and unlawful conjurations and 
exorcisms.
        To understand these last we must consider how they originated, and 
how they came to be abused. For they were in their origin entirely sacred; 
but just as by the means of devils and wicked men all things can be defiled, 
so also were these sacred words. For it is said in the last chapter of S. 
Mark, of the Apostles and holy men: In My Name shall they cast out devils; 
and they visited the sick, and prayed over them with sacred words; and in 
after times priests devoutly used similar rites; and therefore there are to 
be found to-day in ancient Churches devout prayers and holy exorcisms which 
men can use or undergo, when they are applied by pious men as they used to 
be, without any superstition; even as there are now to be found learned men 
and Doctors of holy Theology who visit the sick and use such words for the 
healing not only of demoniacs, but of other diseases as well.
        But, alas! superstitious men have, on the pattern of these, found 
for themselves many vain and unlawful remedies which they employ these days 
for sick men and animals; and the clergy have become too slothful to use any 
more the lawful words when they visit the sick. On this account Gulielmus 
Durandus, the commentator on S. Raymond, says that such lawful exorcisms may 
be used by a religious and discreet priest, or by a layman, or even by a 
woman of good life and proved discretion; by the offering of lawful prayers 
over the sick: not over fruits or animals, but over the sick. For the Gospel 
says: They shall place their hands upon the sick, etc. And such persons are 
not to be prevented from practising in this way; unless perhaps it is feared 
that, following their example, other indiscreet and superstitious persons 
should make improper use of incantations. It is these superstitious diviners 
whom that virgin we have mentioned condemned, when she said that they who 
consulted with such had weak, that is to say bad, faith.
        Now for the elucidation of this matter it is asked how it is 
possible to know whether the words of such charms and benedictions are 
lawful or superstitious, and how they ought to be used; and whether the 
devil can be conjured and diseases exorcised.
        In the first place, that is said to be lawful in the Christian 
religion which is not superstitious; and that is said to be superstitious 
which is over and above the prescribed form of religion. See Colossians ii: 
which things indeed have a show of wisdom in superstition: on which the 
gloss says: Superstition is undisciplined religion, that is, religion 
observed with defective methods in evil circumstance.
        Anything, also, is superstition which human tradition without higher 
authority has caused to usurp the name of religion; such is the 
interpolation of hymns at Holy Mass, the alteration of the Preface for 
Requiems, the abbreviation of the Creed which it to be sung at Mass, the 
reliance upon an organ rather than upon the choir for the music, neglect to 
have a Server on the Altar, and such practices. But to return to our point, 
when a work is done by virtue of the Christian religion, as when someone 
wishes to heal the sick by means of prayer and benediction and sacred words, 
which is the matter we are considering), such a person must observe seven 
conditions by which such benedictions are rendered lawful. And even if he 
uses adjurations, through the virtue of the Divine Name, and by the virtue 
of the works of Christ, His Birth, Passion and Precious Death, by which the 
devil was conquered and cast out; such benedictions and charms and exorcisms 
shall be called lawful, and they who practise them are exorcists or lawful 
enchanters. See S. Isidore, Etym. VIII, Enchanters are they whose art and 
skill lies in the use of words.
        And the first of these conditions, as we learn from S. Thomas, is 
that there must be nothing in the words which hints at any expressed or 
tacit invocation of devils. If such were expressed, it would be obviously 
unlawful. If it were tacit, it might be considered in the light of 
intention, or in that of fact: in that of intention, when the operator has 
no care whether it is God or the devil who is helping him, so long as he 
attains his desired result; in that of fact, when a person has no natural 
aptitude for such work, but creates some artificial means. And of such not 
only must physicians and astronomers be the judges, but especially 
Theologians. For in this way do necromancers work, making images and rings 
and stones by artificial means; which have no natural virtue to effect the 
results which they very often expect: therefore the devil must be concerned 
in their works.
        Secondly, the benedictions or charms must contain no unknown names; 
for according to S. John Chrysostom such are to be regarded with fear, lest 
they should conceal some matter of superstition.
        Thirdly, there must be nothing in the words that is untrue; for if 
there is, the effect of them cannot be from God, Who is not a witness to a 
lie. But some old women in their incantations use some such jingling 
doggerel as the following:
Blessed MARY went a-walking
Over Jordan river.
Stephen met her, and fell a-talking, etc.

        Fourthly, there must be no vanities, or written characters beyond 
the sign of the Cross. Therefore the charms which soldiers are wont to carry 
are condemned.
        Fifthly, no faith must be placed in the method of writing or reading 
or binding the charm about a person, or in any such vanity, which has 
nothing to do with the reverence of God, without which a charm is altogether 
superstitious.
        Sixthly, in the citing and uttering of Divine words and of Holy 
Scripture attention must only be paid to the sacred words themselves and 
their meaning, and to the reverence of God; whether the effect be looked for 
from the Divine virtue, or from the relics of Saints, which are a secondary 
power, since their virtue springs originally from God.
        Seventhly, the looked-for effect must be left tot he Divine Will; 
for He knows whether it is best for a man to be healed or to be plagued, or 
to die. This condition was set down by S. Thomas.
        So we may conclude that if none of these conditions be broken, the 
incantation will be lawful. And S. Thomas writes in this connexion on the 
last chapter of S. Mark: And these signs shall follow them that believe; in 
my name shall they cast out devils; they shall take up serpents. From this 
it is clear that, provided the above conditions are observed, it is lawful 
by means of sacred words to keep serpents away.
        S. Thomas says further: The words of God are not less holy than the 
Relics of the Saints. As S. Augustine says: The word of God is not less than 
the Body of Christ. But all are agreed that it is lawful to carry reverently 
about the person the Relics of the Saints: therefore let us by all means 
invoke the name of God by duly using the Lord's Prayer and the Angelic 
Salutation, by His Birth and Passion, by His Five Wounds, and by the Seven 
Words which He spoke on the Cross, by the Triumphant Inscription, by the 
three nails, and by the other weapons of Christ's army against the devil and 
his works. By all these means it is lawful to work, and our trust may be 
placed in them, leaving the issue to God's will.
        And what has been said about the keeping off of serpents applies 
also to other animals, provided that the attention is fixed only on the 
sacred words and the Divine virtue. But great care is to be used in 
incantations of this nature. For S. Thomas says: Such diviners often use 
unlawful observances, and obtain magic effects by means of devils, 
especially in the case of serpents; for the serpent was the devil's first 
instrument by which he deceived mankind.
        For in the town of Salzburg there was a certain mage who one day, in 
open view of all, wanted to charm all the snakes into a particular pit, and 
kill them all within an area of a mile. So he gathered all the snakes 
together, and was himself standing over the pit, when last of all there came 
a huge and horrible serpent which would not go into the pit. This serpent 
kept making signs to the man to let it go away and crawl where it would; but 
he would not cease from his incantation, but insisted that, as all the other 
snakes had entered the pit and there died, so also must this horrible 
serpent. But it stood on the opposite side to the warlock, and suddenly 
leapt over the pit and fell upon the man, wrapping itself round his belly, 
and dragged him with itself into the pit, where they both died. From this it 
may be seen that only for a useful purpose, such as driving them away from 
men's houses, are such incantations to be practised, and they are to be done 
by the Divine virtue, and in the fear of God, and with reverence.
        In the second place we have to consider how exorcisms or charms of 
this kind ought to be used, and whether they should be worn round the neck 
or sewn into the clothing. It may seem that such practices are unlawful; for 
S. Augustine says, in the Second Book on the Christian Doctrine: There are a 
thousand magic devices and amulets and charms which are all superstitious, 
and the School of Medicine utterly condemns them all, whether they are 
incantations, or certain marks which are called characters, or engraved 
charms to be hung round the neck.
        Also S. John Chrysostom, commenting on S. Matthew, says: Some 
persons wear round their neck some written portion of the Gospel; but is not 
the Gospel every day read in the church and heard by all? How then shall a 
man be helped by wearing the Gospel round his neck, when he has reaped no 
benefit from hearing it with his ears? For in what does the virtue of the 
Gospel consist; in the characters of its letters, or in the meaning of its 
words? If in the characters, you do well to hang it round your neck; but if 
in the meaning, surely it is of more benefit when planted in the heart than 
when worn round the neck.

        But, on the other hand, the Doctors answer as follows, especially S. 
Thomas where he asks whether it is unlawful to hang sacred words round the 
neck. Their opinion is that, in all charms and writings so worn, there are 
two things to be avoided.
        First, in whatever is written there must be nothing that savours of 
an invocation of devils; for then it is manifestly superstitious and 
unlawful, and must be judged as an apostasy from the faith, as has often 
been said before.
        Similarly, in accordance with the above seven conditions, it must 
not contain any unknown names. But if these two snares be avoided, it is 
lawful both to place such charms on the lips of the sick, and for the sick 
to carry them with them. But the Doctors condemn their use in one respect, 
that is, when a man pays greater attention to and has more reliance upon the 
mere signs of the written letters than upon their meaning.
        It may be said that a layman who does not understand the words 
cannot pay any attention to their meaning. But it is enough if such a man 
fixes his thoughts on the Divine virtue, and leaves it to the Divine will to 
do what seems good to His mercy.
        In the third place we have to consider whether the devil is to be 
conjured and the disease exorcised at the same time, or whether a different 
order should be observed, or whether one of these operations can take place 
without the other. Here there are several points to be considered. First, 
whether the devil is always present when the sick man is afflicted. Second, 
what sort of things are capable of being exorcised or remedied. Third, the 
method of exorcising.
        For the first point, it would seem, following that pronouncement of 
S. John Damascene that where the devil operates there he is, that the devil 
is always present in the sick man when he afflicts him. Also in the history 
of S. Bartholomew it seems that a man is only delivered from the devil when 
he is cured of his sickness.
        But this can be answered as follows. When it is said that the devil 
is present in a sick man, this can be understood in two ways: either that he 
is personally present, or that he is present in the effect which he has 
caused. In the first sense he is present when he first causes the sickness; 
in the second sense he is said to be present not personally but in the 
effect. In this way, when the Doctors ask whether the devil substantially 
inhabits a man who commits mortal sin, they say that he is not personally 
present, but only in effect; just as a master is said to dwell in his 
servants in respect of his mastership. But the case is quite otherwise with 
men who are possessed by a devil.
        For the second point, as to what sort of things can be exorcised, 
the opinion of S. Thomas, Book IV, dist. 6, should be noted, where he says 
that on account of man's sin the devil receives power over a man and over 
everything which a man uses, to hurt him with them; and since there can be 
no compromise of Christ with Belial, therefore whenever anything is to be 
sanctified for Divine worship, it is first exorcised that it may be 
consecrated to God freed from the power of the devil, by which it might be 
turned to the hurt of men. This is shown in the blessing of water, the 
consecration of a church, and in all matters of this sort. Therefore, since 
the first act of reconciliation by which a man is consecrated to God is in 
baptism, it is necessary that man should be exorcised before he is baptized; 
indeed in this it is more imperative than in any other circumstance. For in 
man himself lies the cause by reason of which the devil receives his power 
in other matters which are brought about by man, namely, sin, either 
original or actual. This then is the significance of the words that are used 
in exorcism, as when it is said, “Depart, O Satan, from him”; and likewise 
of the things that are then done.
        To return, then, to the actual point. When it is asked whether the 
disease is to be exorcised and the devil abjured, and which of these should 
be done first; it is answered that not the disease, but the sick and 
bewitched man himself is exorcised: just as in the case of a child, it is 
not the infection of the fomes which is exorcised, but the child itself. 
Also, just as the child is first exorcised, and then the devil is abjured to 
depart; so also is the bewitched person first exorcised, and afterwards the 
devil and his works are bidden to depart. Again, just as salt and water are 
exorcised, so are all things which can be used by the sick man, so that it 
is expedient to exorcise and bless chiefly his food and drink. In the case 
of baptism the following ceremony of exorcism is observed: the exsufflation 
towards the West and the renunciation of the devil; secondly, the raising of 
the hands with a solemn confession of the faith of the Christian religion; 
thirdly, prayer, benediction, and the laying on of hands; fourthly, the 
stripping and anointing with Holy Oil; and after baptism, the communion and 
the putting on of the chrisom, he is to remain bound naked to a Holy Candle 
of the length of Christ's body or of the Cross. And then may be said the 
following:
        I exorcise thee, Peter, or thee, Barbara, being weak but reborn in 
Holy Baptism, by the living God, by the true God, by God Who redeemed thee 
with His Precious Blood, that thou mayest be exorcised, that all the 
illusions and wickedness of the devil's deceits may depart and flee from 
thee together with every unclean spirit, adjured by Him Who will come to 
judge both the quick and the dead, and who will purge the earth with fire. 
Amen.

        Let us pray.
        O God of mercy and pity, Who according to Thy tender lovingkindness 
chastenest those whom Thou dost cherish, and dost gently compel those whom 
Thou receivest to turn their hearts, we invoke Thee, O Lord, that Thou wilt 
vouchsafe to bestow Thy grace upon Thy servant who suffereth from a weakness 
in the limbs of his body, that whatever is corrupt by earthly frailty, 
whatever is made violate by the deceit of the devil, may find redemption in 
the unity of the body of the Church. Have mercy, O Lord, on his groaning, 
have mercy upon his tears; and as he putteth his trust only in Thy mercy, 
receive him in the sacrament of Thy reconciliation, through Jesus Christ Our 
Lord. Amen.
        Therefore, accursed devil, hear thy doom, and give honour to the 
true and living God, give honour to the Lord Jesus Christ, that thou depart 
with thy works from this servant whom our Lord Jesus Christ hath redeemed 
with His Precious Blood.
        Then let him exorcise him a second and yet a third time, with the 
prayers as above.

        Let us pray.
        God, Who dost ever mercifully govern all things that Thou hast made, 
incline Thine ear to our prayers, and look in mercy upon Thy servant 
labouring under the sickness of the body; visit him, and grant him Thy 
salvation and the healing virtue of Thy heavenly grace, through Christ our 
Lord. Amen.
        Therefore, accursed devil, etc.

        The prayer for the third exorcism.
        O God, the only protection of human frailty, show forth the mighty 
power of Thy strong aid upon our sick brother (or sister), that being holpen 
by Thy mercy he (she) may be worthy to enter Thy Holy Church in safety, 
through Christ our Lord. Amen.

        And let the exorcist continually sprinkle him with Holy Water. And 
note that this method is recommended, not because it must be rigidly 
observed, or that other exorcisms are not of greater efficacy, but that 
there should be some regular system of exorcism and adjuration. For in the 
old histories and books of the Church there are sometimes found more devout 
and powerful exorcisms; but since before all things the reverence of God is 
necessary, let each proceed in this matter as he finds it best.
        In conclusion, and for the sake of clearness, we may recommend this 
form of exorcism for a person who is bewitched. Let him first make a good 
confession (according to the often-quoted Canon: If by sortilege, etc.). 
Then let a diligent search be made in all corners and in the beds and 
mattresses and under the threshold of the door, in case some instrument of 
witchcraft may be found. The bodies of animals bewitched to death are at 
once to be burned. And it is expedient that all bed-clothes and garments 
should be renewed, and even that he should change his house and dwelling. 
But in case nothing is found, then he who is to be exorcised should if 
possible go into the church in the morning, especially on the Holier Days, 
such as the Feast of Our Lady, or on some Vigil; and the better if the 
priest also has confessed and is in a state of grace, for then the stronger 
will he be. And let him who is to be exorcised hold in his hand a Holy 
Candle as well as he can, either sitting or kneeling; and let those who are 
present offer up devout prayers for his deliverance. And let him begin the 
Litany at “Our help is in the Name of the Lord,” and let one be appointed to 
make the responses: let him sprinkle him with Holy Water, and place a stole 
round his neck, and recite the Psalm “Haste thee, O God, to deliver me”; and 
let him continue the Litany for the Sick, saying at the Invocation of the 
Saints, “Pray for him and be favourable; deliver him, O Lord,” continuing 
thus to the end. But where the prayers are to be said, then in the place of 
the prayers let him begin the exorcism, and continue in the way we have 
declared, or in any other better way, as seems good to him. And this sort of 
exorcism may be continued at least three times a week, that so through many 
intercessions the grace of health may be obtained.
        Finally, he must receive the Sacrament of the Eucharist; although 
some think that this should be done before the exorcism. And at his 
confession the confessor must inquire whether he is under any bond of 
excommunication, and if he is, whether he has rashly omitted to obtain 
absolution from his Judge; for then, although he may at his discretion 
absolve him, yet when he has regained his health, he must seek absolution 
also from the Judge who excommunicated him.
        It should further be noted that, when the exorcist is not ordained 
to the Order of Exorcist, then he may proceed with prayers; and if he can 
read the Scriptures, let him read the beginnings of the four Gospels of the 
Evangelists, and the Gospel beginning, “There was an Angel sent”; and the 
Passion of our Lord; all of which have great power to expel the works of the 
devil. Also let the Gospel of S. John, “In the beginning was the Word,” be 
written and hung round the sick man's neck, and so let the grace of healing 
be looked for from God.
        But if anyone asks what is the difference between the aspersion of 
Holy Water and exorcism, since both are ordained against the plagues of the 
devil, the answer is supplied by S. Thomas, who says: The devil attacks us 
from without and from within. Therefore Holy Water is ordained against his 
attacks from without; but exorcism against those from within. For this 
reason those for whom exorcism is necessary are called Energoumenoi, from 
En, meaning In, and Ergon, meaning Work, since they labour within 
themselves. But in exorcising a bewitched person both methods are to be 
used, because he is tormented both within and without.
        Our second main consideration is what is to be done when no healing 
grace results from exorcisms. Now this may happen for six reasons; and there 
is a seventh about which we suspend any definite judgement. For when a 
person is not healed, it is due either to want of faith in the bystanders or 
in those who present the sick man, or to the sins of them who suffer from 
the bewitchment, or to a neglect of the due and fitting remedies, or to some 
flaw in the faith of the exorcist, or to the lack of a greater trust in the 
powers of another exorcist, or to the need of purgation and for the 
increased merit of the bewitched person.
        Concerning the first four of these the Gospel teaches us in the 
incident of the only son of his father, who was a lunatic, and of the 
disciples of Christ being there present (S. Matthew xvii. And S. Mark ix.). 
For in the first place He said that the multitude were without faith; 
whereupon the father prayed Him, saying: Lord, I believe: help Thou mine 
unbelief. And JESUS said to the multitude: O faithless and perverse 
generation, how long shall I be with you?
        Secondly, with regard to him who endured the devil, JESUS rebuked 
him, that is, the son; for, as Saint Jerome says, he had been tormented by 
the devil because of his sins.
        Thirdly, this illustrates the neglect of the rightful remedies, 
because good and perfect men were not at first present. For S. John 
Chrysostom says: The pillars of faith, namely, Peter and James and John, 
were not present, for they were at the Transfiguration of Christ: neither 
were there prayer and fasting, without which Christ said that this sort of 
devil goeth not out. Therefore Origen, writing on this passage, says: If at 
any time a man be not cured after prayer, let us not wonder or ask questions 
or speak, as if the unclean spirit were listening to us; but let us cast out 
our evil spirits by prayer and fasting. And the gloss says: This sort of 
devil, that is, the variability of carnal desires induced by that spirit, is 
not conquered except by strengthening the soul with prayer, and subduing the 
flesh with fasting.

        Fourthly, the flaw in the faith of the exorcist is exemplified in 
the disciples of Christ who were present. For when they afterwards asked Him 
privately the cause of their failure, He answered: Because of your unbelief: 
for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye 
shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence, etc. And S. Hilary says: The 
Apostles believed indeed, but they were not yet perfect in faith: for while 
the Lord was away in the mountain with the other three, and they remained 
with the multitude, their faith became lukewarm.
        The fifth reason is illustrated in the Lives of the Fathers, where 
we read that certain possessed persons could not be delivered by S. Antony, 
but were delivered by his disciple, Paul.
        The sixth reason has already been made clear; for not always when a 
man is freed from sin is he also freed from punishment, but sometimes the 
penalty remains as a punishment and atonement for the previous sin.
        There is yet another remedy by which many have been said to be 
delivered, namely, the re-baptizing of those who are bewitched; but this is 
a matter on which, as we have said, we can make no definite pronouncement. 
Nevertheless it is most true that when a person has not been duly exorcised 
before baptism, the devil, with God's permission, has always more power 
against such a person. And it is clearly shown without any doubt in what has 
just been written, that much negligence is committed by improperly 
instructed priests (in which case it pertains to the fourth of the above-
noted impediments, namely, a flaw in the exorcist), or else by old women who 
do not observe the proper method of baptism at the necessary time.
        However, God forbid that I should maintain that the Sacraments 
cannot be administered by wicked men, or that when baptism is performed by a 
wicked man it is not valid, provided that he observes the proper forms and 
words. Similarly in the exorcism let him proceed with due care, not timidly 
and not rashly. And let no one meddle with such sacred offices by any 
accidental or habitual omission of any necessary forms or words; for there 
are four matters to be observed in the right performance of exorcism, 
namely, the matter, the form, the intention and the order, as we have set 
them out above; and when one of these is lacking it cannot be complete.
        And it is not valid to object that in the primitive Church persons 
were baptized without exorcism, and that even now a person is truly baptized 
without any exorcism; for in that case S. Gregory would have instituted 
exorcism in vain, and the Church would be in error in its ceremonies. 
Therefore I have not dared altogether to condemn the re-baptism under 
certain conditions of bewitched persons, that they may recover that which 
was at first omitted.
        It is said, also, of those who walk in their sleep during the night 
over high buildings without any harm, that it is the work of evil spirits 
who thus lead them; and many affirm that when such people are re-baptized 
they are much benefited. And it is wonderful that, when they are called by 
their own names, they suddenly fall back to earth, as if that name had not 
been given to them in proper form at their baptism.
        Let the reader pay attention to those six impediments mentioned 
above, although they refer to Energoumenoi, or men possessed, rather than to 
men bewitched; for though equal virtue is required in both cases, yet it may 
be said that it is more difficult to cure a bewitched person than one 
possessed. Therefore those impediments apply even more pertinently to the 
case of those who are bewitched; as is proved by the following reasoning.
        It was shown in Chapter X of the First Question of the Second Part 
that some men are at times possessed for no sin of their own, but for the 
venial sin of another man, and for various other causes. But in witchcraft, 
when adults are bewitched, it generally happens to them that the devil 
grievously possesses them from within for the destruction of their souls. 
Therefore the labour required in the case of the bewitched is twofold, 
whereas it is only single in the case of the possessed. Of this most 
grievous possession John Cassian speaks in his Collation of the Abbot 
Serenus: They are truly to be judged unhappy and miserable who, although 
they pollute themselves with every crime and wickedness, yet show no outward 
sign of being filled with the devil, nor does there seem to be any 
temptation commensurate with their deeds, nor any punishment sufficient to 
restrain them. For they do not deserve even the healing medicine of 
purgatory, who in their hardness of heart and impenitence are beyond the 
reach of any earthly correction, and lay up to themselves anger and 
vengeance in that day of wrath and revelation of the Just Judgement, when 
their worm shall not die.
        And a little earlier, comparing the possession of the body with the 
binding of the soul in sin, he says: Far more grievous and violent is the 
torment of those who show no sign of being bodily possessed by devils, but 
are most terribly possessed in their souls, being fast bound by their sins 
and vices. For according to the Apostle, a man becomes the slave of him by 
whom he is conquered. And in this respect their case is the most desperate, 
since they are the servants of devils, and can neither resist nor tolerate 
that domination. It is clear then that, not they who are possessed by the 
devil from without, but they who are bewitched in their bodies and possessed 
from within to the perdition of their souls, are, by reason of many 
impediments, the more difficult to heal.
        Our third main consideration is that of curative charms, and it is 
to be noted that these are of two sorts. They are either quite lawful and 
free from suspicion, or they are to be suspected and are not altogether 
lawful. We have dealt with the first sort in Chapter V, towards the end, 
where we disposed of a doubt as to the legality of using herbs and stones to 
drive away a bewitchment.
        Now we must treat the second sort which are under suspicion of not 
being altogether lawful; and we must draw attention to what was said in the 
Introduction to the Second Question of the Second Part of this work as to 
the four remedies, of which three are judged to be unlawful, and the fourth 
not altogether so, but vain, being that of which the Canonists say that it 
is lawful to oppose vanity to vanity. But we Inquisitors are of the same 
opinion as the Holy Doctors, that when, owing to the six or seven 
impediments which we have detailed, the remedies of sacred words and lawful 
exorcism are not sufficient, then those who are so bewitched are to be 
exhorted to bear with patient spirit the devils of this present life for the 
purgation of their crimes, and not to seek further in any way for 
superstitious and vain remedies. Therefore, if anyone is not content with 
the aforesaid lawful exorcisms, and wishes to have recourse to remedies 
which are, at least, vain, of which we have spoken before, let him know that 
he does not do this with our consent or permission. But the reason why we 
have so carefully explained and detailed such remedies is that we might 
bring into some sort of agreement the opinions of such Doctors as Duns 
Scotus and Henry of Segusio on the one hand, and those of the other 
Theologians on the other hand. Yet we are in agreement with S. Augustine in 
his Sermon against Fortune-tellers and Diviners, which is called the Sermon 
on Auguries, where he says: Brethren, you know that I have often entreated 
you that you should not follow the customs of Pagans and sorcerers, but this 
has had little effect on some of you. Yet, if I do not speak out to you, I 
shall be answerable for you in the Day of Judgement, and both you and I must 
suffer eternal damnation. Therefore I absolve myself before God, that again 
and again I admonish and adjure you, that none of you seek out diviners or 
fortune-tellers, and that you consult with them for no cause or infirmity; 
for whosoever commits this sin, the sacrament of baptism is immediately lost 
in him, and he at once becomes a sacrilegious and a Pagan, and unless he 
repents will perish in eternity.
        And afterwards he adds: Let no one observe days for going out and 
coming back; for God hath made all things well, and He Who ordained one day 
ordained also another. But as often as you have to do anything or to go out, 
cross yourselves in the name of Christ, and saying faithfully the Creed or 
the Lord's Prayer you may go about your business secure in the help of God.
        But certain superstitious sons of our times, not content with the 
above securities and accumulating error upon error, and going beyond the 
meaning or intention of Scotus and the Canonists, try to justify themselves 
with the following arguments. That natural objects have certain hidden 
virtues the cause of which cannot be explained by men; as a lodestone 
attracts iron, and many other such things which are enumerated by S. 
Augustine in the City of God, xxi. Therefore, they say, to seek the recovery 
of one's health by the virtue of such things, when exorcisms and natural 
medicines have failed, will not be unlawful, although it may seem to be 
vain. This would be the case if a man tried to procure his own or another's 
health by means of images, not necromantic but astrological, or by rings and 
such devices. They argue also that, just as natural matter is subject to the 
influence of the stars, so also are artificial objects such as images, which 
receive some hidden virtue from the stars by which they can cause certain 
effects: therefore it is not unlawful to make use of such things.
        Besides, the devils can in very many ways change bodies, as S. 
Augustine says, de Trinitate, 3, and as is evident in the case of those who 
are bewitched: therefore it is lawful to use the virtues of such bodies for 
the removing of witchcraft.
        But actually all the Holy Doctors are of an entirely contrary 
opinion to this, as has been shown here and there in the course of this 
work.
        Therefore we can answer their first argument in this way: that if 
natural objects are used in a simple way to produce certain effects for 
which they are thought to have some natural virtue, this is not unlawful. 
But if there are joined to this certain characters and unknown signs and 
vain observations, which manifestly cannot have any natural efficacy, then 
it is superstitious and unlawful. Wherefore S. Thomas, II, q. 96, art. 2, 
speaking of this matter, says that when any object is used for the purpose 
of causing some bodily effect, such as curing the sick, notice must be taken 
whether such objects appear to have any natural quality which could cause 
such an effect; and if so, then it is not unlawful, since it is lawful to 
apply natural causes to their effects. But if it does not appear that they 
can naturally cause such effects, it follows that they are not applied as 
causes of those effects, but as signs or symbols; and so they pertain to 
some pact symbolically formed with devils. Also S. Augustine says, in the 
City of God, xxi: The devils ensnare us by means of creatures formed not by 
themselves, but by God, and with various delights consonant with their own 
versatility; not as animals with food, but as spirits with signs, by various 
kinds of stones and herbs and trees, animals and charms and ceremonies.
        Secondly, S. Thomas, says: The natural virtues of natural objects 
follow their material forms which they obtain from the influence of the 
stars, and from the same influence they derive certain active virtues. But 
the forms of artificial objects proceed from the conception of the 
craftsman; and since, as Aristotle says in his Physics, I, they are nothing 
but an artificial composition, they can have no natural virtue to cause any 
effect. It follows then that the virtue received from the influence of the 
stars can only reside in natural and not in artificial objects. Therefore, 
as S. Augustine says in the City of God, x, Porphyry was in error when he 
thought that from herbs and stones and animals, and from certain sounds and 
voices and figures, and from certain configurations in the revolutions of 
the stars and their motions, men fabricated on earth certain Powers 
corresponding to the various effects of the stars; as if the effects of 
magicians proceeded from the virtue of the stars. But, as S. Augustine adds, 
all such matters belong to the devils, the deceivers of souls which are 
subject to them. So also are those images which are called astronomical the 
work of devils, the sign of which is that they have inscribed upon them 
certain characters which can have no natural power to effect anything; for a 
figure or sign is no cause of natural action. But there is this difference 
between the images of astronomers and those of necromancers; that in the 
case of the latter there is an open invocation, and therefore an open and 
expressed pact with devils; whereas the signs and characters on astronomical 
images imply only a tacit pact.
        Thirdly, there is no power given to men over devils, whereby a man 
may lawfully use them for his own purposes; but there is war declared 
between man and the devils, therefore by no means may he use the help of 
devils, by either a tacit or an expressed pact with them. So says S. Thomas.
        To return to the point: he says, "By no means"; therefore not even 
by the means of any vain things in which the devil may in any way be 
involved. But if they are merely vain, and man in his frailty has recourse 
to them for the recovery of his health, let him repent for the past and take 
care for the future, and let him pray that his sins may be forgiven and that 
he be no more led into temptation; as S. Augustine says at the end of his 
Rule. 




Chapter VII  Remedies prescribed against Hailstorms, and for animals that 
are Bewitched.  

        With regard to the remedies for betwitched animals, and charms 
against tempests, we must first note some unlawful remedies which are 
practised by certain people. For these are done by means of superstitious 
words or actions; as when men cure the worms in the fingers or limbs by 
means of certain words or charms, the method of deciding the legality of 
which has been explained in the preceding chapter. There are others who do 
not sprinkle Holy Water over bewitched cattle, but pour it into their 
mouths.
        Beside the proofs we have already given that the remedy of words is 
unlawful, William of Paris, whom we have often quoted, gives the following 
reason. If there were any virtue in words as words, then it would be due to 
one of three things: either their material, which is air; or their form, 
which is sound; or their meaning; or else to all three together. Now it 
cannot be due to air, which has no power to kill unless it be poisonous; 
neither can it be due to sound, the power of which is broken by a more solid 
object; neither can it be due to the meaning, for in that case the words 
Devil or Death or Hell would always be harmful, and the words Health and 
Goodness always be beneficial. Also it cannot be due to all these three 
together; for when the parts of a whole are invalid, the whole itself is 
also invalid.
        And it cannot validly be objected that God gave virtue to words just 
as He did to herbs and stones. For whatever virtue there is in certain 
sacramental words and benedictions and lawful incantations belongs to them, 
not as words, but by Divine institution and ordinance according to God's 
promise. It is, as it were, a promise from God that whoever does such and 
such a thing will receive such and such a grace. And so the words of the 
sacraments are effective because of their meaning; although some hold that 
they have an intrinsic virtue; but these two opinions are not mutually 
inconsistent. But the case of other words and incantations is clear from 
what has already been said; for the mere composing or uttering or writing of 
words, as such, can have no effect; but the invocation of the Divine Name, 
and public prayer, which is a sacred protestation committing the effect to 
the Divine Will, are beneficial.
        We have treated above of remedies performed by actions which seem to 
be unlawful. The following is a common practice in parts of Swabia. On the 
first of May before sunrise the women of the village go out and gather from 
the woods leaves and branches from willow trees, and weave them into a 
wreath which they hang over the stable door, affirming that all the cattle 
will then remain unhurt and safe from witchcraft for a whole year. And in 
the opinion of those who hold that vanity may be opposed by vanity, this 
remedy would not be unlawful; and neither would be the driving away of 
diseases by unknown cantrips and incantations. But without meaning and 
offence, we say that a woman or anyone else may go out on the first or any 
other day of the month, without considering the rising or the setting of the 
sun, and collect herbs or leaves and branches, saying the Lord's Prayer or 
the Creed, and hang them over the stable door in good faith, trusting to the 
will of God for their protective efficacy; yet even so the practice is not 
above reproach, as was shown in the preceding chapter in the words of S. 
Jerome; for even if he is not invoked, the devil has some part in the 
efficacy of herbs and stones.
        It is the same with those who make the sign of the Cross with leaves 
and consecrated flowers on Palm Sunday, and set it up among their vines or 
crops; asserting that, although the crops all round should be destroyed by 
hail, yet they will remain unharmed in their own fields. Such matters should 
be decided upon according to the distinction of which we have already 
treated.
        Similarly there are women who, for the preservation of milk and that 
cows should not be deprived of their milk by witchcraft, give freely to the 
poor in God's name the whole of a Sunday's yield of milk; and say that, by 
this sort of alms, the cows yield even more milk and are preserved from 
witchcraft. This need not be regarded as superstitious, provided that it is 
done out of pity for the poor, and that they implore the Divine mercy for 
the protection of their cattle, leaving the effect to the good pleasure of 
Divine providence.
        Again, Nider in the First chapter of his Præceptorium says that it 
is lawful to bless cattle, in the same way as sick men, by means of written 
charms and sacred words, even if they have the appearance of incantations, 
as long as the seven conditions we have mentioned are observed. For he says 
that devout persons and virgins have been known to sign a cow with the sign 
of the Cross, together with the Lord's Prayer and the Angelic Salutation, 
upon which the devil's work has been driven off, if it is due to witchcraft.
        And in his Formicarius he tells that witches confess that their 
witchcraft is obstructed by the reverent observation of the ceremonies of 
the Church; as by the aspersion of Holy Water, or the consumption of 
consecrated salt, by the lawful use of candles on the Day of Purification 
and of blessed palms, and such things. For this reason the Church uses these 
in her exorcisms, that they may lessen the power of the devil.
        Also, because when witches wish to deprive a cow of milk they are in 
the habit of begging a little of the milk or butter which comes from that 
cow, so that they may afterwards by their art bewitch the cow; therefore 
women should take care, when they are asked by persons suspected of this 
crime, not to give away the least thing to them.
        Again, there are women who, when they have been turning a church for 
a long while to no purpose, and if they suspect that this is due to some 
witch, procure if possible a little butter from the house of that witch. 
Then they make that butter into three pieces and throw them into the churn, 
invoking the Holy Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; and so 
all witchcraft is put to flight. Here again it is a case of opposing vanity 
to vanity, for the simple reason that the butter must be borrowed from the 
suspected witch. But if it were done without this; if with the invocation of 
the Holy Trinity and the Lord's Prayer the woman were to commit the effect 
of the Divine Will, she would remain beyond reproach. Nevertheless it is not 
a commendable practice to throw in the three pieces of butter; for it would 
be better to banish the witchcraft by means of sprinkling Holy Water or 
putting in some exorcised salt, always with the prayers we have mentioned.
        Again, since often the whole of a person's cattle are destroyed by 
witchcraft, those who have suffered in this way ought to take care to remove 
the soil under the threshold of the stable or stall, and where the cattle go 
to water, and replace it with fresh soil sprinkled with Holy Water. For 
witches have often confessed that they have placed some instrument of 
witchcraft at the instance of devils, they have only had to make a hole in 
which the devil has placed the instrument of witchcraft; and that this was a 
visible object, such as a stone or a piece of wood or a mouse or some 
serpent. For it is agreed that the devil can perform such things by himself 
without the need of any partner; but usually, for the perdition of her soul, 
he compels a witch to co-operate with him.
        In addition to the setting up of the sign of the Cross which we have 
mentioned, the following procedure is practised against hailstorms and 
tempests. Three of the hailstones are thrown into the fire with an 
invocation of the Most Holy Trinity, and the Lord's Prayer and the Angelic 
Salutation are repeated twice or three times, together with the Gospel of S. 
John, In the beginning was the Word. And the sign of the Cross is made in 
every direction towards each quarter of the world. Finally, The Word was 
made Flesh is repeated three times, and three times, “By the words of this 
Gospel may this tempest be dispersed.” And suddenly, if the tempest is due 
to witchcraft, it will cease. This is most true and need not be regarded 
with any suspicion. For if the hailstones were thrown into the fire without 
the invocation of the Divine Name, then it would be considered 
superstitious.
        But it may be asked whether the tempest could not be stilled without 
the use of those hailstones. We answer that it is the other sacred words 
that are chiefly effective; but by throwing in the hailstones a man means to 
torment the devil, and tries to destroy his works by the invocation of the 
Holy Trinity. And he throws them into the fire rather than into water, 
because the more quickly they are dissolved the sooner is the devil's work 
destroyed. But he must commit to the Divine Will the effect which is hoped 
for.
        Relevant to this is the reply given by a witch to a Judge who asked 
her if there were any means of stilling a tempest raised by witchcraft. She 
answered: Yes, by this means. I adjure you, hailstorms and winds, by the 
five wounds of Christ, and by the three nails which pierced His hands and 
feet, and by the four Holy Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, that 
you be dissolved and fall as rain.
        Many also confess, some freely and some under stress of torture, 
that there are five things by which they are much hindered, sometimes 
entirely, sometimes in part, sometimes so that they cannot harm his friends. 
And these are, that a man should have a pure faith and keep the commandments 
of God; that he should protect himself with the sign of the Cross and with 
prayer; that he should reverence the rites and ceremonies of the Church; 
that he should be diligent in the performance of public justice; and that he 
should meditate aloud or in his heart on the Passion of Christ. And of these 
things Nider also speaks. And for this reason it is a general practice of 
the Church to ring bells as a protection against storms, both that the 
devils may flee from them as being consecrated to God and refrain from their 
wickedness, and also that the people may be roused up to invoke God against 
tempests with the Sacrament of the Altar and sacred words, following the 
very ancient custom of the Church in France and Germany.
        But since this method of carrying out the Sacrament to still a storm 
seems to many a little superstitious, because they do not understand the 
rules by which it is possible to distinguish between that which is 
superstitious and that which is not; therefore it must be considered that 
five rules are given by which anyone may know whether an action is 
superstitious, that is, outside the observances of the Christian religion, 
or whether it is in accordance with the due and proper worship and honour of 
God, proceeding from the true virtue of religion both in the thoughts of the 
heart and in the actions of the body. For these are explained in the gloss 
on Colossians ii, where S. Paul says: Which things have a show of wisdom in 
superstition; and the gloss says: Superstition is religion observed without 
due discipline; as was said before.
        The first of these is, that in all our works the glory of God ought 
to be our chief aim; as it is said: Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever 
else ye do, do all in the glory of God. Therefore in every work relating to 
the Christian religion let care be taken that it is to the glory of God, and 
that in it man should give the glory chiefly to God, so that by that very 
work the mind of man may be put in subjection to God. And although, 
according to this rule, the ceremonies and legal procedures of the Old 
Testament are not now observed, since they are to be understood 
figuratively, whereas the truth is made known in the New Testament, yet the 
carrying out of the Sacrament or of Relics to still a storm does not seem to 
militate against this rule.
        The second rule is that care should be taken that the work is a 
discipline to restrain concupiscence, or a bodily abstinence, but in the way 
that is owed to virtue, that is, according to the rites of the Church and 
moral doctrine. For S. Paul says, Romans xii: Let your service be 
reasonable. And because of this rule, they are foolish who make a vow not to 
comb their hair on the Sabbath, or who fast on Sunday, saying, The better 
the day the better the deed, and such like. But again it does not seem that 
it is superstitious to carry out the Sacrament, etc.
        The third rule is to be sure that what is done is in accordance with 
the statutes of the Catholic Church, or with the witness of Holy Scripture, 
or according at least to the rites of some particular Church, or in 
accordance with universal use, which S. Augustine says may be taken as a 
law. Accordingly when the Bishops of the English were in doubt because the 
Mass was celebrated in different manners in different Churches, S. Gregory 
wrote to them that they might use whatever methods they found most pleasing 
to God, whether they followed the rites of the Roman or of the Gallican or 
of any other Church. For the fact that different Churches have different 
methods in Divine worship does not militate against the truth, and therefore 
such customs are to be preserved, and it is unlawful to neglect them. And 
so, as we said in the beginning, it is a very ancient custom in the Churches 
of France and some parts of Germany, after the consecration of the Eucharist 
to carry It out into the open; and this cannot be unlawful, provided that It 
is not carried exposed to the air, but enclosed and contained in a Pyx.
        The fourth rule is to take care that what is done bears some natural 
relation to the effect which is expected; for if it does not, it is judged 
to be superstitious. On this account unknown characters and suspected names, 
and the images or charts of necromancers and astronomer, are altogether to 
be condemned as suspect. But we cannot say that on this account it is 
superstitious to carry out Holy Relics or the Eucharist as a protection 
against the plagues of the devil; for it is rather a most religious and 
salutary practice, since in that Sacrament lies all our help against the 
Adversary.
        The fifth rule is to be careful that what is done should give no 
occasion for scandal or stumbling; for in that case, although it be not 
superstitious, yet because of the scandal it should be forgone or postponed, 
or done secretly without scandal. Therefore if this carrying of the 
Sacrament can be done without scandal, or even secretly, then it should not 
be neglected. For by this rule many secular priests neglect the use of 
benedictions by means of devout words either uttered over the sick or bound 
round their necks. I say that nothing should be done, at least publicly, if 
it can give any occasion of stumbling to other simple folk.
        Let this be enough on the subject of the remedies against 
hailstorms, either by words or lawful actions. 




Chapter VIII  Certain Remedies prescribed against those Dark and Horrid 
Harms with which Devils may Afflict Men.  

        Yet again we reserve our judgement in discussing the remedies 
against certain injuries to the fruits of the earth, which are caused by 
canker-worms, or by huge flights of locusts and other insects which cover 
vast areas of land, and seem to hide the surface of the ground, eating up 
everything to the very roots in the vineyards and devouring fields of ripe 
crops. In the same light too we consider the remedies against the stealing 
of children by the work of devils.
        But with regard to the former kind of injury we may quote S. Thomas, 
the Second of the Second, Question 90, where he asks whether it is lawful to 
adjure an irrational creature. He answers that it is; but only in the way of 
compulsion, by which it is sent back to the devil, who uses irrational 
creatures to harm us. And such is the method of adjuration in the exorcisms 
of the Church by which the power of the devil is kept away from irrational 
creatures. But if the adjuration is addressed to the irrational creature 
itself, which understands nothing, then it would be nugatory and vain. From 
this it can be understood that they can be driven off by lawful exorcisms 
and adjurations, the help of the Divine mercy being granted; but first the 
people should be bidden to fast and to go in procession and practice other 
devotions. For this sort of evil is sent on account of adulteries and the 
multiplication of crimes; wherefore men must be urged to confess their sins.
        In some provinces even solemn excommunications are pronounced; but 
then they obtain power of adjuration over devils.
        Another terrible thing which God permits to happen to men is when 
their own children are taken away from women, and strange children are put 
in their place by devils. And these children, which are commonly called 
changelings, or in the German tongue Wechselkinder, are of three kinds. For 
some are always ailing and crying, and yet the milk of four women is not 
enough to satisfy them. Some are generated by the operation of Incubus 
devils, of whom, however, they are not the sons, but of that man from whom 
the devil has received the semen as a Succubus, or whose semen he has 
collected from some nocturnal pollution in sleep. For these children are 
sometimes, by Divine permission, substituted for the real children.
        And there is a third kind, when the devils at times appear in the 
form of young children and attach themselves to the nurses. But all three 
kinds have this in common, that though they are very heavy, they are always 
ailing and do not grow, and cannot receive enough milk to satisfy them, and 
are often reported to have vanished away.
        And it can be said that the Divine pity permits such things for two 
reasons. First, when the parents dote upon their children too much, and this 
a punishment for their own good. Secondly, it is to be presumed that the 
women to whom such things happen are very superstitious, and are in many 
other ways seduced by devils. But God is truly jealous in the right sense of 
the word, which means a strong love for a man's own wife, which not only 
does not allow another man to approach her, but like a jealous husband will 
not suffer the hint or suspicion of adultery. In the same way is God jealous 
of the soul which He bought with His Precious Blood and espoused in the 
Faith; and cannot suffer it to be touched by, to converse with, or in any 
way to approach or have dealings with the devil, the enemy and adversary of 
salvation. And if a jealous husband cannot suffer even a hint of adultery, 
how much more will he be disturbed when adultery is actually committed! 
Therefore it is no wonder if their own children are taken away and 
adulterous children substituted.
        And indeed that it may be more strongly impressed how God is jealous 
of the soul, and will not suffer anything which might cause a suspicion, it 
is shown in the Old Law where, that He might drive His people farther from 
idolatry, He not only forbade idolatry, but also many other things which 
might give occasion to idolatry, and seemed to have no use in themselves, 
although in some marvellous way they retain some use in a mystical sense. 
For He not only says in Exodus xxii: Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live 
on this earth; but He adds this: She shall not dwell in thy land, lest 
perchance she cause thee to sin. Similarly common bawds and bulkers are put 
to death, and not allowed to company with men.
        Note the jealousy of God, Who says as follows in Deuteronomy xxii: 
If thou find a bird's nest, and the dam sitting upon the eggs or upon the 
young ones, thou shalt not take the dam with the young, but thou shalt let 
the dam fly away; because the Gentiles used these to procure sterility. The 
jealous God would not suffer in His people this sign of adultery. In like 
manner in our days when old women find a penny, they think it a sign of 
great fortune; and conversely, when they dream of money it is an unlucky 
sign. Also God taught that all vessels should be covered, and that when a 
vessel had no cover it should be considered unclean.
        There was an erroneous belief that when devils came in the night (or 
the Good People as old women call them, though they are witches, or devils 
in their forms) they must eat up everything, that afterwards they may bring 
greater abundance of stores. Some people give colour to the story, and call 
them Screech Owls; but this is against the opinion of the Doctors, who say 
that there are no rational creatures except men and Angels; therefore they 
can only be devils.
        Again, in Leviticus xix: Ye shall not round the corners of your 
heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard; because they did 
this idolatrously in veneration of idols.
        Again in Deuteronomy xxii: God says that men shall not put on the 
garments of women, or conversely; because they did this in honour of the 
goddess Venus, and others in honour of Mars or Priapus.
        And for the same reason He commanded the altars of idols to be 
destroyed; and Hezechias destroyed the Brazen Serpent when the people wanted 
to sacrifice to it, saying: It is brass. For the same reason He forbade the 
observance of visions and auguries, and commanded that the man or woman in 
whom there was a familiar spirit should be put to death. Such are now called 
soothsayers. All these things, because they give rise to suspicion of 
spiritual adultery, therefore, as has been said, from the jealousy which God 
has for the souls He has espoused, as a husband espouses a wife, they were 
all forbidden by Him.
        And so we preachers also ought to bear in mind that no sacrifice is 
more acceptable to God than a jealousy of souls, as S. Jerome says in his 
commentaries upon Ezekiel.
        Therefore in the Third Part of this work we shall treat the 
extermination of witches, which is the ultimate remedy. For this is the last 
recourse of the Church, to which she is bound by Divine commandment. For it 
has been said: Ye shall not suffer witches to live upon the earth. And with 
this will be included the remedies against archer-wizards; since this kind 
can only be exterminated by secular law.
        A remedy. When certain persons for the sake of temporal gain have 
devoted themselves entirely to the devil, it has often been found that, 
though they may be freed from the devil's power by true confession, yet they 
have been long and grievously tormented, especially in the night. And God 
allows this for their punishment. But a sign that they have been delivered 
is that, after confession, all the money in their purses or coffers 
vanishes. Many examples of this could be adduced, but for the sake of 
brevity they are passed over and omitted.

Witnesses are not Revealed to him. Ths Sixth Action  

(the rest is missing)




General and Introductory  Who are the Fit and Proper Judges in the Trial of 
Witches?  

        The question is whether witches, together with their patrons and 
protectors and defenders, are so entirely subject to the jurisdiction of the 
Diocesan Ecclesiastical Court and the Civil Court so that the Inquisitors of 
the crime of heresy can be altogether relieved from the duty of sitting in 
judgement upon them. And it is argued that this is so. For the Canon (c. 
accusatus, § sane, lib. VI) says: Certainly those whose high privilege it is 
to judge concerning matters of the faith ought not to be distracted by other 
business; and Inquisitors deputed by the Apostolic See to inquire into the 
pest of heresy should manifestly not have to concern themselves with 
diviners and soothsayers, unless these are also heretics, nor should it be 
their business to punish such, but they may leave them to be punished by 
their own judges.
        Nor does there seem any difficulty in the fact that the heresy of 
witches is not mentioned in that Canon. For these are subject to the same 
punishment as the others in the court of conscience, as the Canon goes on to 
say (dist. I, pro dilectione). If the sin of diviners and witches is secret, 
a penance of forty days shall be imposed upon them: if it is notorious, they 
shall be refused the Eucharist. And those whose punishment is identical 
should receive it from the same Court. Then, again, the guilt of both being 
the same, since just as soothsayers obtain their results by curious means, 
so do witches look for and obtain from the devil the injuries which they do 
to creatures, unlawfully seeking from His creatures that which should be 
sought from God alone; therefore both are guilty of the sin of idolatry.
        This is the sense of Ezechiel xxi, 23; that the King of Babylon 
stood at the cross-roads, shuffling his arrows and interrogating idols.
        Again it may be said that, when the Canon says “Unless these are 
also heretics,” it allows that some diviners and soothsayers are heretics, 
and should therefore be subject to trial by the Inquisitors; but in that 
case artificial diviners would also be so subject, and no written authority 
for that can be found.
        Again, if witches are to be tried by the Inquisitors, it must be for 
the crime of heresy; but it is clear that the deeds of witches can be 
committed without any heresy. For when they stamp into the mud of the Body 
of Christ, although this is a most horrible crime, yet it may be done 
without any error in the understanding, and therefore without heresy. For it 
is entirely possible for a person to believe that It is the Lord's body, and 
yet throw It into the mud to satisfy the devil, and this by reason of some 
pact with him, that he may obtain some desired end, such as the finding of a 
treasure or anything of that sort. Therefore the deeds of witches need 
involved no error in faith, however great the sin may be; in which case they 
are not liable to the Court of the Inquisition, but are left to their own 
judges.
        Again, Solomon showed reverence to the gods of his wives out of 
complaisance, and was not on that account guilty of apostasy from the Faith; 
for in his heart he was faithful and kept the true Faith. So also when 
witches give homage to devils by reason of the pact they have entered into, 
but keep the Faith in their hearts, they are not on that account to be 
reckoned as heretics.
        But it may be said that all witches have to deny the Faith, and 
therefore must be judged heretics. On the contrary, even if they were to 
deny the Faith in their hearts and minds, still they could not be reckoned 
as heretics, but as apostates. But a heretic is different from an apostate, 
and it is heretics who are subject to the Court of the Inquisition; 
therefore witches are not so subject.
        Again it is said, in c. 26, quest. 5: Let the Bishops and their 
representatives strive by every means to rid their parishes entirely of the 
pernicious art of soothsaying and magic derived from Zoroaster; and if they 
find any man or woman addicted to this crime, let him be shamefully cast out 
of their parishes in disgrace. So when it says at the end of c. 348, Let 
them leave them to their own Judges; and since it speaks in the plural, both 
of the Ecclesiastic and the Civil Court; therefore, according to this Canon 
they are subject to no more than the Diocesan Court.
        But if, just as these arguments seem to show it to be reasonable in 
the case of Inquisitors, the Diocesans also wish to be relieved of this 
responsibility, and to leave the punishment of witches to the secular 
Courts, such a claim could be made good by the following arguments. For the 
Canon says, c. ut inquisitionis: We strictly forbid the temporal lords and 
rulers and their officers in any way to try to judge this crime, since it is 
purely an ecclesiastical matter: and it speaks of the crime of heresy. It 
follows therefore that, when the crime is not purely ecclesiastical, as is 
the case with witches because of the temporal injuries which they commit, it 
must be punished by the Civil and not by the Ecclesiastical Court.
        Besides, in the last Canon Law concerning Jews it says: His goods 
are to be confiscated, and he is to be condemned to death, because with 
perverse doctrine he opposed the Faith of Christ. But if it is said that 
this law refers to Jews who have been converted, and have afterwards 
returned to the worship of the Jews, this is not a valid objection. Rather 
is the argument strengthened by it; because the civil Judge has to punish 
such Jews as apostates from the Faith; and therefore witches who abjure the 
Faith ought to be treated in the same way; for abjuration of the Faith, 
either wholly or in part, is the essential principle of witches.
        And although it says that apostasy and heresy are to be judged in 
the same way, yet it is not the part of the ecclesiastical but of the civil 
Judge to concern himself with witches. For no one must cause a commotion 
among the people by reason of a trial for heresy; but the Governor himself 
must make provision for such cases.
        The Authentics of Justinian, speaking of ruling princes, says: You 
shall not permit anyone to stir up your Province by reason of a judicial 
inquiry into matters concerning religions or heresies, or in any way allow 
an injunction to be put upon the Province over which you govern; but you 
shall yourself provide, making use of such monies and other means of 
investigation as are competent, and not allow anything to be done in matters 
of religion except in accordance with our precepts. It is clear from this 
that no one must meddle with a rebellion against the Faith except the 
Governor himself.
        Besides, if the trial and punishment of such witches were not 
entirely a matter for the civil Judge, what would be the purpose of the laws 
which provide as follows? All those who are commonly called witches are to 
be condemned to death. And again: Those who harm innocent lives by magic 
arts are to be thrown to the beasts. Again, it is laid down that thy are to 
be subjected to questions and tortures; and that none of the faithful are to 
associate with them, under pain of exile and the confiscation of all their 
goods. And many other penalties are added, which anyone may read in those 
laws.
        But in contradiction of all these arguments, the truth of the matter 
is that such witches may be tried and punished conjointly by the Civil and 
the Ecclesiastical Courts. For a canonical crime must be tried by the 
Governor and the Metropolitan of the Province; not by the Metropolitan 
alone, but together with the Governor. This is clear in the Authentics, 
where ruling princes are enjoined as follows: If it is a canonical matter 
which is to be tried, you shall inquire into it together with the 
Metropolitan of the Province. And to remove all doubt on this subject, the 
gloss says: If it is a simple matter of the observance of the faith, the 
Governor alone may try it; but if the matter is more complicated, then it 
must be tried by a Bishop and the Governor; and the matter must be kept 
within decent limits by someone who has found favour with God, who shall 
protect the orthodox faith, and impose suitable indemnities of money, and 
keep our subjects inviolate, that is, shall not corrupt the faith in them.
        And again, although a secular prince may impose the capital 
sentence, yet this does not exclude the judgement of the Church, whose part 
it is to try and judge the case. Indeed this is perfectly clear from the 
Canon Law in the chapters de summa trin. and fid. cath., and again in the 
Law concerning heresy, c. ad abolendam and c. urgentis and c. 
excommunicamus, 1 and 2. For the same penalties are provided by both the 
Civil and the Canon Laws, as is shown by the Canon Laws concerning the 
Manichaean and Arian heresies. Therefore the punishment of witches belongs 
to both Courts together, and not to one separately.
        Again, the laws decree that clerics shall be corrected by their own 
Judges, and not by the temporal or secular Courts, because their crimes are 
considered to be purely ecclesiastical. But the crime of witches is partly 
civil and partly ecclesiastical, because they commit temporal harm and 
violate the faith; therefore it belongs to the Judges of both Courts to try, 
sentence, and punish them.
        This opinion is substantiated by the Authentics, where it is said: 
If it is an ecclesiastical crime needing ecclesiastical punishment and fine, 
it shall be tried by a Bishop who stands in favour with God, and not even 
the most illustrious Judges of the Province shall have a hand in it. And we 
do not wish the civil Judges to have any knowledge of such proceedings; for 
such matters must be examined ecclesiastically and the souls of the 
offenders must be corrected by ecclesiastical penalties, according to the 
sacred and divine rules which our laws worthily follow. So it is said. 
Therefore it follows that on the other hand a crime which is of a mixed 
nature must be tried and punished by both courts.
        We make our answer to all the above as follows. Our main object here 
is to show how, with God's pleasure, we Inquisitors of Upper Germany may be 
relieved of the duty of trying witches, and leave them to be punished by 
their own provincial Judges; and this because of the arduousness of the 
work: provided always that such a course shall in no way endanger the 
preservation of the faith and the salvation of souls. And therefore we 
engaged upon this work, that we might leave to the Judges themselves the 
methods of trying, judging and sentencing in such cases.
        Therefore in order to show that the Bishops can in many cases 
proceed against witches without the Inquisitors; although they cannot so 
proceed without the temporal and civil Judges in cases involving capital 
punishment; it is expedient that we set down the opinions of certain other 
Inquisitors in parts of Spain, and (saving always the reverence due to 
them), since we all belong to one and the same Order of Preachers, to refute 
them, so that each detail may be more clearly understood.
        Their opinion is, then, that all witches, diviners, necromancers, 
and in short all who practise any kind of divination, if they have once 
embraced and professed the Holy Faith, are liable to the Inquisitorial 
Court, as in the three cases noted in the beginning of the chapter, Multorum 
querela, in the decretals of Pope Clement concerning heresy; in which it 
says that neither must the Inquisitor proceed without the Bishop, nor the 
Bishop without the Inquisitor: although there are five other cases in which 
one may proceed without the other, as anyone who reads the chapter may see. 
But in one case it is definitively stated that one must not proceed without 
the other, and that is when the above diviners are to be considered as 
heretics.
        In the same category they place blasphemers, and those who in any 
way invoke devils, and those who are excommunicated and have contumaciously 
remained under the ban of excommunication for a whole year, either because 
of some matter concerning faith or, in certain circumstances, not on account 
of the faith; and they further include several other such offences. And by 
reason of this the authority of the Ordinary is weakened, since so many more 
burdens are placed upon us Inquisitors which we cannot safely bear in the 
sight of the terrible Judge who will demand from us a strict account of the 
duties imposed upon us.
        And because their opinion cannot be refuted unless the fundamental 
thesis upon which it is founded is proved unsound, it is to be noted that it 
is based upon the commentators on the Canon, especially on the chapter 
accusatus, and § sane, and on the words “savour of heresy.” Also they rely 
upon the sayings of the Theologians, S. Thomas, Blessed Albert, and S. 
Bonaventura, in the Second Book of Sentences, dist. 7.
        It is best to consider some of these in detail. For when the Canon 
says, as was shown in the first argument, that the Inquisitors or heresy 
should not concern themselves with soothsayers and diviners unless they 
manifestly savour of heresy, they say that soothsayers and diviners are of 
two sorts, either artificial or heretical. And the first sort are called 
diviners pure and simple, since they work merely by art; and such are 
referred to in the chapter de sortilegiis, where it says that the presbyter 
Udalricus went to a secret place with a certain infamous person, that is, a 
diviner, says the gloss, not with the intention of invoking the devil, which 
would have been heresy, but that, by inspecting the astrolabe, he might find 
out some hidden thing. And this, they say, is pure divination or sortilege. 

        But the second sort are called heretical diviners, whose art 
involves some worship of or subjection to devils, and who essay by 
divination to predict the future of something of that nature, which 
manifestly savours of heresy; and such are, like other heretics, liable to 
the Inquisitorial Court.
        And that this is the meaning of the Canon they prove from 
commentaries of the Canonists on the word “savour.” For Giovanni d’Andrea, 
writing on this Canon accusatus, and the word “saviour,” says: They savour 
of heresy in this way, that they utter nefarious prayers and offer 
sacrifices at the altars of idols, and they consult with devils and receive 
answers from them; or they meet together to practise heretical sortes, that 
they may have an answer, re-baptize a child, and practise other such 
matters.
        Many others also they quote in support of their opinion, including 
John Modestus; S. Raymund, and William de Laudun, O.P. And they refer to the 
decision of the Church at the Council of Aquitaine, c. 26, q. 5, Episcopi, 
where such superstitious women are called infidels, saying, Would that these 
had perished alone in their perfidy. And perfidy in a Christian is called 
heresy; therefore they are subject to the Court of the Inquisitors of 
heresy.
        They quote also the Theologians, especially S. Thomas, the Second 
Book of Sentences, dist. 7, where he considers whether it is a sin to use 
the help of devils. For speaking of that passage in Esaias viii: Should not 
a people seek unto their God? he says among other things: In everything the 
fulfilment of which is looked for from the power of the devil, because of a 
pact entered into with him, there is apostasy from the faith, either in 
word, if there is some invocation, or in deed, even if there be no sacrifice 
offered.
        To the same effect they quote Albertus, and Peter of Tarentaise, and 
Giovanni Bonaventura, who has lately been canonized, not under the name of 
Giovanni, although that was his true name. Also they quote Alexander of 
Hales and Guido the Carmelite. All these say that those who invoke devils 
are apostates, and consequently heretics, and therefore subject to the Court 
of the Inquisitors of heretics.
        But the said Inquisitors of Spain have not, by the above or any 
other arguments, made out a sufficient case to prove that such soothsayers 
etc. may not be tried by the Ordinary or the Bishops without the 
Inquisitors; and that the Inquisitors may not be relieved from the duty of 
trying such diviners and necromancers, and even witches: not that the 
Inquisitors are not rather to be praised than blamed when they do try such 
cases, when the Bishops fail to do so. And this is the reason that they have 
not proved their case. The Inquisitors need only concern themselves with 
matters of heresy, and the heresy must be manifest; as is shown by the 
frequently quoted Canon accusatus, § sane.
        This being the case, it follows that however serious and grave may 
be the sin which a person commits, if it does not necessarily imply heresy, 
then he must not be judged as a heretic, although he is to be punished. 
Consequently an Inquisitor need not interfere in the case of a man who is to 
be punished as a malefactor, but not as a heretic, but may leave him to be 
tried by the Judges of his own Province.
        It follows again that all the crimes of invoking devils and 
sacrificing to them, of which the Commentators and Canonists and Theologians 
speak, are no concern of the Inquisitors, but can be left to the secular or 
episcopal Courts, unless they also imply heresy. This being so, and it being 
the case that the crimes we are considering are very often committed without 
any heresy, those who are guilty of such crimes are not to be judged or 
condemned as heretics, as is proved by the following authorities and 
arguments.
        For a person rightly to be adjudged a heretic he must fulfil five 
conditions. First, there must be an error in his reasoning. Secondly, that 
error must be in matters concerning the faith, either being contrary to the 
teaching of the Church as to the true faith, or against sound morality and 
therefore not leading to the attainment of eternal life. Thirdly, the error 
must lie in one who has professed the Catholic faith, for otherwise he would 
be a Jew or a Pagan, not a heretic. Fourthly, the error must be of such a 
nature that he who holds it must confess some of the truth of Christ as 
touching either His Godhead or His Manhood; for is a man wholly denies the 
faith, he is an apostate. Fifthly, he must pertinaciously and obstinately 
hold to and follow that error. And that this is the sense of heretics is 
proved as follows (not by way of refuting, but of substantiating the gloss 
of the Canonists).
        For it is well known to all through common practice that the first 
essential of a heretic is an error in the understanding; but two conditions 
are necessary before a man can be called a heretic; the first material, that 
is, an error in reasoning, and the second formal, that is, an obstinate 
mind. S. Augustine shows this when he says: A heretic is one who either 
initiates or follows new and false opinions. It can also be proved by the 
following reasoning: heresy is a form of infidelity, and infidelity exists 
subjectively in the intellect, in such a way that a man believes something 
which is quite contrary to the true faith.
        This being so, whatever crime a man commits, if he acts without an 
error in his understanding he is not a heretic. For example, if a man 
commits fornication or adultery, although he is disobeying the command Thou 
shalt not commit adultery, yet he is not a heretic unless he holds the 
opinion that it is lawful to commit adultery. The point can be argued in 
this way: When the nature of a thing is such that two constituent parts are 
necessary to its existence, if one of those two parts is wanting the thing 
itself cannot exist; for if it could, then it would not be true that that 
part is necessary to its existence. For in the constitution of a house it is 
necessary that there should be a foundation, walls, and a roof; and if one 
of these is missing, there is no house. Similarly, since an error in the 
understanding is a necessary condition of heresy, no action which is done 
entirely without any such error can make a man a heretic.
        Therefore we Inquisitors of Germany are in agreement with Blessed 
Antoninus where he treats of this matter in the second part of his Summa; 
saying that to baptize things, to worship devils, to sacrifice to them, to 
tread underfoot the Body of Christ, and all such terrible crimes, do not 
make a man a heretic unless there is an error in his understanding. 
Therefore a man is not a heretic who, for example, baptizes an image, not 
holding any erroneous belief about the Sacrament of Baptism or its effect, 
nor thinking that the baptism of the image can have any effect of its own 
virtue; but does this in order that he may more easily obtain some desire 
from the devil whom he seeks to please by this means, acting with either an 
implied or an expressed pact that the devil will fulfil the desires either 
of himself or of someone else. In this way men who, with either a tacit or 
an expressed pact, invoke devils with characters and figures in accordance 
with magic practice to perform their desires are not necessarily heretics. 
But they must not ask from the devil anything which is beyond the power or 
the knowledge of the devil, having a wrong understanding of his power and 
knowledge. Such would be the case with any who believed that the devil could 
coerce a man's free will; or that, by reason of their pact with him, the 
devil could do anything which they desired, however much it were forbidden 
by God; or that the devil can know the whole of the future; or that he can 
effect anything which only God can do. For there is no doubt that men with 
such beliefs have an error in their understanding, holding a wrong opinion 
of the power of the devil; and therefore, granting the other conditions 
necessary for heresy, they would be heretics, and would be subject at once 
to the Ordinary and to the Inquisitorial Court.
        But if they act for the reasons we have said, not out of any wrong 
belief concerning baptism or the other matters we have mentioned, as they 
very commonly do; for since witches and necromancers know that the devil is 
the enemy of the faith and the adversary of salvation, it must follow that 
they are compelled to believe in their hearts that there is great might in 
the faith and that there is no false doctrine of which the father of lies is 
not known to be the origin; then, although they sin most grievously, yet 
they are not heretics. And the reason is that they have no wrong belief 
concerning the sacrament, although they use it wrongly and sacrilegiously. 
Therefore they are rather sorcerers than heretics, and are to be classed 
with those whom the above Canon accusatus declares are not properly subject 
to the Inquisitorial Court, since they do not manifestly savour of heresy; 
their heresy being hidden, if indeed it exists at all.
        It is the same with those who worship and sacrifice to the devil. 
For if they do this in the belief that there is any divinity in devils, or 
that they ought to be worshipped and that, by reason of such worship, that 
can obtain from the devil what they desire in spite of the prohibition or 
permission of God, then they are heretics. But if they act in such a way not 
out of any such belief concerning the devil, but so that they may the more 
easily obtain their desires because of some pact formed with the devil, then 
they are not necessarily heretics, although they sin most grievously.
        For greater clearness, some objections are to be disposed of and 
refuted. For it appears to be against our argument that, according to the 
laws, a simonist is not a heretic (1, q. 1: “Whoever by means of money, but 
not having an error of the understanding”). For a simonist is not in the 
narrow and exact sense of the word a heretic; but broadly speaking and by 
comparison he is so, according to S. Thomas, when he buys or sells holy 
things in the belief that the gift of grace can be had for money. But if, as 
is often the case, he does not act in this belief, he is not a heretic. Yet 
he truly would be if he did believe that the gift of grace could be had for 
money.
        Again we are apparently in opposition to what is said of heretics in 
the Canon; namely, that he who reveres a heretic is himself a heretic, but 
he who worships the devil sins more heavily than he who reveres a heretic, 
therefore, etc.
        Also, a man must be obviously a heretic in order that he may be 
judged as such. For the Church is competent to judge only of those things 
which are obvious, God alone having knowledge and being the Judge of that 
which is hidden (dist. 33, erubescant). But the inner understanding can only 
be made apparent by intrinsic actions, either seen or proved; therefore a 
man who commits such actions as we are considering is to be judged a 
heretic.
        Also, it seems impossible that anyone should commit such an action 
as the treading underfoot of the Body of Christ unless he held a wrong 
opinion concerning the Body of Christ; for it is impossible for evil to 
exist in the will unless there is error in the understanding. For according 
to Aristotle every wicked man is either ignorant or in error. Therefore, 
since they who do such things have evil in their wills, they must have an 
error in their understandings.
        To these three objections we answer as follows; and the first and 
third may be considered together. There are two kinds of judgement, that of 
God and that of men. God judges the inner man; whereas man can only judge of 
the inner thoughts as they are reflected by outer actions, as is admitted in 
the third of these arguments. Now he who is a heretic in the judgement of 
God is truly and actually a heretic; for God judges no one as a heretic 
unless he has some wrong belief concerning the faith in his understanding. 
But when a man is a heretic in the judgement of men, he need not necessarily 
be actually a heretic; but because his deeds give an appearance of a wrong 
understanding of the faith he is, by legal presumption, considered to be a 
heretic.
        And if it be asked whether the Church should stigmatize at once as 
heretics those who worship devils or baptize imagines, note these answers. 
First, it belongs rather to the Canonists than to the Theologians to 
discriminate in this matter. The Canonists will say that they are by legal 
presumption to be considered as heretics, and to be punished as such. A 
Theologian will say that it is in the first instance a matter for the 
Apostolic See to judge whether a heresy actually exists or is only to be 
presumed in law. And this may be because whenever an effect can proceed from 
a twofold cause, no precise judgement can be formed of he actual nature of 
the cause merely on the basis of the effect.
        Therefore, since such effects as the worship of the devil or asking 
his help in the working of witchcraft, by baptizing an image, or offering to 
him a living child, or killing an infant, and other matters of this sort, 
can proceed from two separate causes, namely, a belief that it is right to 
worship the devil and sacrifice to him, and that images can receive 
sacraments; or because a man has formed some pact with the devil, so that he 
may obtain the more easily from the devil that which he desires in those 
matters which are not beyond the capacity of the devil, as we have explained 
above; it follows that no one ought hastily to form a definite judgement 
merely on the basis of the effect as to what is its cause, that is, whether 
a man does such things out of a wrong opinion concerning the faith. So when 
there is no doubt about the effect, still it is necessary to inquire farther 
into the cause; and if it be found that a man has acted out of a perverse 
and erroneous opinion concerning the faith, then he is to be judged a 
heretic and will be subject to trial by the Inquisitors together with the 
Ordinary. But if he has not acted for these reasons, he is to be considered 
a sorcerer, and a very vile sinner. 

        Another answer which touches the matter nearly is that, whatever may 
be said and alleged, it is agreed that all diviners and witches are judged 
as heretics by legal presumption and not by actual fact are subject to the 
Court of the Ordinary, not of the Inquisitors. And the aforesaid Inquisitors 
of other countries cannot defend their opinions by quoting the Canon and its 
commentators, because they who sacrifice to and worship devils are judged to 
be heretics be legal presumption, and not because the facts obviously show 
that they are such. For the text says that they must savour of heresy 
manifestly, that is, intrinsically and by their very nature. And it is 
enough for us Inquisitors to concern ourselves with those who are manifestly 
from the instrinsic nature of the case heretics, leaving others to their own 
judges.
        It has been said that the cause must be inquired into, to know 
whether or not a man acts out of an error of faith; and this is easy. For 
the spirit of faith is known by the act of faith; as the spirit of chastity 
is shown by a chaste life; similarly the Church must judge a man a heretic 
if his actions show that he disputes any article of the faith. In this way 
even a witch, who has wholly or in part denied the faith, or used vilely the 
Body of Christ, and offered homage to the devil, may have done this merely 
to propitiate the devil; and even if she has totally denied the faith in her 
heart, she is to be judged as an apostate, for the fourth condition, which 
is necessary before anyone can rightly be said to be a heretic, will be 
wanting.
        But if against this conclusion be set the Bull and commission given 
to us by our Holy Father Innocent VIII, that witches should be tried by the 
Inquisitors, we answer in this way. That this is not to say that the 
Diocesans also cannot proceed to a definite sentence against witches, in 
accordance with those ancient laws, as has been said. For that Bull was 
rather given to us because of the great care with which we have wrought to 
the utmost of our ability with the help of God.
        Therefore we cannot concede to those other Inquisitors their first 
argument, since the contrary conclusion is rather the true one; for 
simonists are thought to be heretics only be legal presumption, and the 
Ordinaries themselves without the Inquisitors can try them. Indeed, the 
Inquisitors have no need to concern themselves with various simonists, or 
similarly with any others who are judged to be heretics only by legal 
presumption. For they cannot proceed against schismatic Bishops and other 
high Dignitaries, as is shown by the chapter of the Inquisition Concerning 
Heretics, Book VI, where is says: The Inquisitors of the sin of heresy 
deputed by the Apostolic See or by any other authority have no power to try 
such offenders on this sort of charge, or to proceed against them under 
pretext of their office, unless it is expressly stated in the letters of 
commission from the Apostolic See that they are empowered to do so.
        But if the Inquisitors know or discover that Bishops or other high 
Dignitaries have been charged with heresy, or have been denounced or 
suspected of that crime, it is their duty to report the fact to the 
Apostolic See.
        Similarly the answer to their second argument is clear from what has 
been said. For he who cherishes and comforts a heretic is himself a heretic 
if he does this in the belief that he is worthy to be cherished or honoured 
on account of his doctrine or opinion. But if he honours him for some 
temporal reason, without any error of faith in his understanding, he is not 
rightly speaking a heretic, though he is so by a legal fiction or 
presumption or comparison, because he acts as if he held a wrong belief 
concerning the faith like him whom he cherishes: so in this case he is not 
subject to the Inquisitorial Court.
        The third argument is similarly answered. For though a man should be 
judged by the Church as a heretic on account of his outward actions, visible 
and proved, yet it does not always follow that he is actually a heretic, but 
is only so reputed by legal presumption. Therefore in this case he is not 
liable to be tried by the Inquisitorial Court, because he does not 
manifestly savour of heresy.
        For their fourth argument, it is a false assumption to say that it 
is not possible for anyone to tread underfoot the Body of Christ unless he 
has some perverse and wrong belief concerning the Body of Christ. For a man 
may do this with a full knowledge of his sin, and with a firm belief that 
the Body of Christ is truly there. But he does it to please the devil, and 
that he may more easily obtain his desire from him. And though in every sin 
there is an error, it need not necessarily be an error of the understanding, 
which is heresy or a wrong belief concerning the faith; for it may be an 
erroneous use of some power which turns it to vicious purposes; and then it 
will only be the first of those five conditions which are necessary 
constituents of heresy, in accordance with which a heretic is rightly liable 
to the Inquisitorial Court.
        And it is not a valid objection to say that an Inquisitor may, 
nevertheless, proceed against those who are denounced as heretics, or are 
under a light or a strong or a grave suspicion of heresy, although they do 
not appear to savour manifestly of heresy. For we answer that an Inquisitor 
may proceed against such in so far as they are denounced or suspected for 
heresy rightly so called; and this is the sort of heresy of which we are 
speaking (as we have often said), in which there is an error in the 
understanding, and the other four conditions are superadded. And the second 
of these conditions is that such error should consist in matters concerning 
the faith, or should be contrary to the true decisions of the Church in 
matters of faith and good behaviour and that which is necessary for the 
attainment of eternal life. For if the error be in some matter which does 
not concern the faith, as, for example, a belief that the sun is not greater 
than the earth, or something of that sort, then it is not a dangerous error. 
But an error against Holy Scripture, against the articles of the faith, or 
against the decision of the Church, as has been said above, is heresy (art. 
24, q. 1, haec est fides).
        Again, the determination of doubts respecting the faith belongs 
chiefly to the Church, and especially to the Supreme Pontiff, Christ's 
Vicar, the successor of S. Peter, as is expressly stated (art. 24, q. 1, 
quotiens). And against the determination of the Church, as S. Thomas says, 
art. 2, q. 2, no Doctor or Saint maintains his own opinion; not S. Jerome 
nor S. Augustine nor any other. For just as he who obstinately argues 
against the faith is a heretic, so also is he who stubbornly maintains his 
opinion against the determination of the Church in matters concerning the 
faith and that which is necessary for salvation. For the Church herself has 
never been proved to be in error over matter of faith (as it is said in art. 
24, q. 1, a recta, and in other chapters). And it is expressly said, that he 
who maintains anything against the determination of the Church, not in an 
open and honest manner, but in matters which concern faith and salvation, is 
a heretic. For he need not be a heretic because he disagrees over other 
matters, such as the separability of law from use in matters which are 
affected by use: this matter has been settled by Pope John XXII in his 
Extrauagantes, where he says that they who contradict this opinion are 
stubborn and rebellious against the Church, but not heretics.
        The third condition required is that he who holds the error should 
be one who has professed the Catholic faith. For is a man has never 
professed the Christian faith, he is not a heretic but simply an infidel, 
like the Jews or the Gentiles who are outside the faith. Therefore S. 
Augustine says in the City of God: The devil, seeing the human race to be 
delivered from the worship of idols and devils, stirred up heretics who, 
under the guise of Christians, should oppose Christian doctrine. So for a 
man to be a heretic it is necessary that he should have received the 
Christian faith in baptism.
        Fourthly, it is necessary that the man who so errs should retain 
some of the true belief concerning Christ, pertaining either to His divinity 
or to His humanity. For if he retains no part of the faith, he is more 
rightly to be considered an apostate than a heretic. In this way Julian was 
an apostate. For the two are quite different, though sometimes they are 
confused. For in this manner there are found to be men who, driven by 
poverty and various afflictions, surrender themselves body and soul to the 
devil, and deny the faith, on condition that the devil will help them in 
their need to the attainment of riches and honours.
        For we Inquisitors have known some, of whom a few afterwards 
repented, who have behaved in this way merely for the sake of temporal gain, 
and not through any error in the understanding; wherefore they are not 
rightly heretics, nor even apostates in their hearts, as was Julian, though 
they must be reckoned as apostates.
        They who are apostates in their heart and refuse to return to the 
faith are, like impenitent heretics, to be delivered to the secular Court. 
But if they are desirous of reconciliation, they are received back into the 
Church, like penitent heretics. See the chapter ad abolendam, § praesenti, 
de haeretic., lib. 6. Of the same opinion is S. Raymund in his work de 
Apostolica, cap. reuertentes, where he says that they who return from the 
perfidy of apostasy, though they were heretics, are to be received back like 
penitent heretics. And here the two are confused, as we have said. And he 
adds: Those who deny the faith through fear of death (that is, who deny the 
faith for the sake of temporal gain from the devil, but do not believe their 
error) are heretics in the sight of the law, but are not, properly speaking, 
heretics. And he adds: Although they have no erroneous belief, yet since the 
Church must judge by outward signs they are to be considered as heretics 
(not this fiction of law); and if they return, they are to be received as 
penitent heretics. For the fear of death, or the desire for temporal gain, 
is not sufficient to cause a constant man to deny the faith of Christ. 
Wherefore he concludes that it is more holy to die than to deny the faith or 
to be fed by idolatrous means, as S. Augustine says.
        The judgement of witches who deny the faith would be the same; that 
when they wish to return they should be received as penitents, but otherwise 
they should be left to the secular Court. But they are by all means to be 
received back into the bosom of the Church when they repent; and are left to 
the secular Court if they will not return; and this is because of the 
temporal injuries which they cause, as will be shown in the methods of 
passing sentence. And all this may be done by the Ordinary, so that the 
Inquisitor can leave his duties to him, at least in a case of apostasy; for 
it is otherwise in other cases of sorcerers.
        The fifth condition necessary for a man to be rightly thought a 
heretic is that he should obstinately and stubbornly persist in his error. 
Hence, according to S. Jerome, the etymological meaning of heresy is Choice. 
And again S. Augustine says: Not he who initiates or follows false 
doctrines, but he who obstinately defends them, is to be considered a 
heretic. Therefore if anyone does not evilly persist in believing some false 
doctrine, but errs through ignorance and is prepared to be corrected and to 
be shown that his opinion is false and contrary to Holy Scripture and the 
determination of the Church, he is not a heretic. For he was ready to be 
corrected when his error was pointed out to him. And it is agreed that every 
day the Doctors have various opinions concerning Divine matters, and 
sometimes they are contradictory, so that one of them must be false; and yet 
none of them are reputed to be false until the Church has come to a decision 
concerning them. See art. 24, q. 3, qui in ecclesia.
        From all this is is concluded that the sayings of the Canonists on 
the words “savour manifestly of heresy” in the chapter accusatus do not 
sufficiently prove that witches and others who in any way invoke devils are 
subject to trial by the Inquisitorial Court; for it is only by a legal 
fiction that they judge such to be heretics. Neither is it proved by the 
words of the Theologians; for they call such persons apostates either in 
word or in deed, but not in their thoughts and their hearts; and it is of 
this last error that the words “savour of heresy” speak.
        And though such persons should be judged to be heretics, it does not 
follow form this that a Bishop cannot proceed against them without an 
Inquisitor to a definite sentence, or punish them with imprisonment or 
torture. More than this, even when this decision does not seem enough to 
warrant the exemption of us Inquisitors from the duty of trying witches, 
still we are unwilling to consider that we are legally compelled to perform 
such duties ourselves, since we can depute the Diocesans to our office, at 
least in respect of arriving at a judgement. 

        For this provision is made in the Canon Law (c. multorum in prin. de 
haeret. in Clem.). There it says: As a result of a general complaint, and 
that this sort of Inquisition may proceed more fortunately and the inquiry 
into this crime be conducted more skilfully, diligently, and carefully, we 
order that this kind of case may be tried by the Diocesan Bishops as well as 
by the Inquisitors deputed by the Apostolic See, all carnal hatred or fear 
or any temporal affection of this sort being put aside; and so either of the 
above may move without the other, and arrest or seize a witch, placing her 
in safe custody in fetters and iron chains, if it seems good to him; and in 
this matter we leave the conduct of the affair to his own conscience; but 
there must be no negligence in inquiring into such matters in a manner 
agreeable to God and justice; but such witches must be thrust into prison 
rather as a matter of punishment than custody, or be exposed to torture, or 
be sentenced to some punishment. And a Bishop can proceed without an 
Inquisitor, or an Inquisitor without a Bishop; or, if either of their 
offices be vacant, their deputies may act independently of each other, 
provided that is is impossible for them to meet together for joint action 
within eight days of the time when the inquiry is due to commence; but if 
there be no valid reason for their not meeting together, the action shall be 
null and void in law.
        The chapter proceeds to support our contention as follows: But if 
the Bishop or the Inquisitor, or either of their deputies, are unable or 
unwilling, for any of the reasons which we have mentioned, to meet together 
personally, they can severally depute their duties to each other, or else 
signify their advice and approval by letters.
        From this it is clear that even in those cases where the Bishop is 
not entirely independent of the Inquisitor, the Inquisitor can depute the 
Bishop to act in his stead, especially in the matter of passing sentence: 
therefore we ourselves have decided to act according to this decision, 
leaving other Inquisitors to other districts to act as seems good to them.
        Therefore in answer to the arguments, it is clear that witches and 
sorcerers have not necessarily to be tried by the Inquisitors. But as for 
the other arguments which seek to make it possible for the Bishops in their 
turn to be relieved from the trial of witches, and leave this to the Civil 
Court, it is clear that this is not so easy in their case as it is in that 
of the Inquisitors. For the Canon Law (c. ad abolendam, c. uergentis, and c. 
excommunicamus utrumque) says that in a case of heresy it is for the 
ecclesiastical judge to try and to judge, but for the secular judge to carry 
out the sentence and to punish; that is, when a capital punishment is in 
question, though it is otherwise with other penitential punishments.
        It seems also that in the heresy of witches, though not in the case 
of other heresies, the Diocesans also can hand over to the Civil Courts the 
duty of trying and judging, and this for two reasons: first because, as we 
have mentioned in our arguments, the crime of witches is not purely 
ecclesiastical, being rather civil on account of the temporal injuries which 
they commit; and also because special laws are provided for dealing with 
witches.
        Finally, it seems that in this way it is easiest to proceed with the 
extermination of witches, and that the greatest help is thus given to the 
Ordinary in the sight of that terrible Judge who, as the Scriptures testify, 
will exact the strictest account from and will most hardly judge those who 
have been placed in authority. Accordingly we will proceed on this 
understanding, namely, that the secular Judge can try and judge such cases, 
himself proceeding to the capital punishment, but leaving the imposition of 
any other penitential punishment to the Ordinary. 

A Summary or Classification of the Matters Treated of in this Third Part

        In order, then, that the Judges both ecclesiastical and civil may 
have a ready knowledge of the methods of trying, judging and sentencing in 
these cases, we shall proceed under three main heads. First, the method of 
initiating a process concerning matters of the faith; second, the method of 
proceeding with the trial; and third, the method of bringing it to a 
conclusion and passing sentence on witches.
        The first head deals with five difficulties. First, which of the 
three methods of procedure provided by the law is the most suitable. Second, 
the number of witnesses. Third, whether these can be compelled to take the 
oath. Fourth, the condition of the witnesses. Fifth, whether mortal enemies 
may be allowed to give evidence.
        The second head contained eleven Questions. I. How witnesses are to 
be examined, and that there should always be five persons present. Also how 
witches are to be interrogated, generally and particularly. (This will be 
numbered the Sixth Question of the whole Part; but we alter the numeration 
here to facilitate reference by the reader). II. Various doubts are cleared 
up as to negative answers, and when a witch is to be imprisoned, and when 
she is to be considered as manifestly guilty of the heresy of witchcraft. 
III. The method of arresting witches. IV. Of two duties which devolve upon 
the Judge after the arrest, and whether the names of the deponents should be 
made known to the accused. V. Of the conditions under which an Advocate 
shall be allowed to plead for the defence. VI. What measures the Advocate 
shall take when the names of the witnesses are not made known to him, and 
when he wishes to protest to the Judge that the witnesses are mortal enemies 
of the prisoner. VII. How the Judge ought to investigate the suspicion of 
such mortal enmity. VIII. Of the points which the Judge must consider before 
consigning the prisoner to torture. IX. Of the method of sentencing the 
prisoner to examination by torture. X. Of the method of proceeding with the 
torture, and how they are to be tortured; and of the provisions against 
silence on the part of the witch. XI. Of the final interrogations and 
precautions to be observed by the Judge.
        The third head contains first of all three Questions dealing with 
matters which the Judge must take into consideration, on which depends the 
whole method of passing sentence. First, whether a prisoner can be convicted 
by a trial of red-hot iron. Second, of the method in which all sentences 
should be passed. Third, what degrees of suspicion can justify a trial, and 
what sort of sentence ought to be passed in respect of each degree of 
suspicion. Finally, we treat of twenty methods of delivering sentence, 
thirteen of which are common to all kinds of heresy, and the remainder 
particular to the heresy of witches. But since these will appear in their 
own places, for the sake of brevity they are not detailed here. 




Question I  The Method of Initiating a Process  

        The first question, then, is what is the suitable method of 
instituting a process on behalf of the faith against witches. In answer to 
this it must be said that there are three methods allowed by Canon Law. The 
first is when someone accuses a person before a judge of the crime of 
heresy, or of protecting heretics, offering to prove it, and to submit 
himself to the penalty of talion if he fails to prove it. The second method 
is when someone denounces a person, but does not offer to prove it and is 
not willing to embroil himself in the matter; but says that he lays 
information out of zeal for the faith, or because of a sentence of 
excommunication inflicted by the Ordinary or his Vicar; or because of the 
temporal punishment exacted by the secular Judge upon those who fail to lay 
information.
        The third method involves an inquisition, that is, when there is no 
accuser or informer, but a general report that there are witches in some 
town or place; and then the Judge must proceed, not at the instance of any 
party, but simply by the virtue of his office.
        Here it is to be noted that a judge should not readily admit the 
first method of procedure. For one thing, it is not actuated by motives of 
faith, nor is it very applicable to the case of witches, since they commit 
their deeds in secret. Then, again, it is full of danger to the accuser, 
because of the penalty of talion which he will incur if he fails to prove 
his case. Then, again, it is very litigious.
        Let the process begin with a general citation affixed to the walls 
of the Parish Church or the Town Hall, in the following manner.
        WHEREAS we, the Vicar of such and such Ordinary (or the Judge of 
such and such county), do endeavour with all our might and strive with our 
whole heart to preserve the Christian people entrusted to us in unity and 
the happiness of the Catholic faith and to keep them far removed from every 
plague of abominable heresy: Therefore we the aforesaid Judge to whose 
office it belongs, to the glory and honour of the worshipful name of JESUS 
Christ and for the exaltation of the Holy Orthodox Faith, and for the 
putting down of the abomination of heresy, especially in all witches in 
general and in each one severally of whatever condition or estate: (Here, if 
he is an ecclesiastical Judge, let him add a summons to all priests and 
dignitaries of the Church in that town and for a distance of two miles about 
it, who have knowledge of this notice. And he shall add) By the authority 
which we exercise in this district, and in virtue of holy obedience and 
under pain of excommunication, we direct, command, require, and admonish 
that within the space of twelve days (Here the secular Judge shall command 
in his own manner under pain of penalties suitable to his office), the first 
four of which shall stand for the first warning, the second for the second, 
and the third for the third warning; and we give this treble canonical 
warning that if anyone know, see, or have heard that any person is reported 
to be a heretic or a witch, or of any is suspected especially of such 
practices as cause injury to men, cattle, or the fruits of the earth, to the 
loss of the State. But if any do not obey these aforesaid commands and 
admonitions by revealing such matters within the term fixed, let him know 
(Here the ecclesiastical Judge shall add) that he is cut off by the sword of 
excommunication (The secular Judge shall add the temporal punishments). 
Which sentence of excommunication we impose as from this time by this 
writing upon all and several who thus stubbornly set at naught these our 
canonical warnings aforesaid, and our requirement of their obedience, 
reserving to ourselves alone the absolution of such sentence (The secular 
Judge shall conclude in this manner). Given, etc.
        Note also that in the case of the second method the following 
caution should be observed. For it has been said that the second method of 
procedure and of instituting a process on behalf of the faith is by means of 
an information, where the informer does not offer to prove his statement and 
is not ready to be embroiled in the case, but only speaks because of a 
sentence of excommunication, or out of zeal for the faith and for the good 
of the State. Therefore the secular Judge must specify in his general 
citation or warning aforesaid, that none should think that he will become 
liable to a penalty even if he fails to proved his words; since he comes 
forward not as an accuser but as an informer.
        And then, since several will appear to lay information before the 
Judge, he ought to take care to proceed in the following manner. First, let 
him have a Notary and two honest persons, either clerics or laymen; or if a 
Notary is not to be procured, then let there be two suitable men in the 
place of the Notary. For this is dealt with in the c. ut officium, § uerum, 
lib. 6, where it is said: But because it is expedient to proceed with great 
caution in the trial of a grave crime, that no error may be committed in 
imposing upon the guilty a deservedly severe punishment; we desire and 
command that, in the examination of the witnesses necessary in such a 
charge, you shall have two religious and discreet persons, either clerics or 
laymen.
        It goes on to say: In the presence of these persons the depositions 
of the witnesses shall be faithfully written down by a public official if 
one is obtainable, or, if not, by two suitable men. Note therefore that, 
having these persons, the Judge shall order the informer to lay his 
information in writing, or at least give it clearly by word of mouth. And 
then the Notary or the Judge shall begin to process in the following manner. 

In the Name of the Lord. Amen.

        In the year of Our Lord —, on the — day of the — month, in the 
presence of me the Notary and of the witnesses subscribed, N. of the town of 
— in the Diocese of —, as above, appeared in the person at — before the 
honourable Judge, and offered him a schedule to the following effect.
        (Here shall follow the schedule in its entirety. But if he has not 
deposed in writing buy by word of mouth, it shall continue thus.)
        He appeared, etc. and laid information to the Judge that N. of the 
town or parish of — in the Diocese of — had said and asserted that he knew 
how to perform or had actually done certain injuries to the deponent or to 
other persons.
        After this, he shall immediately make the deponent take the oath in 
the usual manner, either on the four Gospels of God, or on the Cross, 
raising three fingers and depressing two in witness of the Holy Trinity and 
of the damnation of his soul and body, that he will speak the truth in his 
depositions. And when the oath has been sworn, he shall question him as to 
how he knows that his depositions are true, and whether he saw or heard that 
to which he swears. And if he says that he has seen anything, as, for 
example, that the accused was present at such a time of tempest, or that he 
had touched an animal, or had entered a stable, the Judge shall ask when he 
saw him, and where, and how often, and in what manner, and who were present. 
If he says that he did not see it, but heard of it, he shall ask him from 
whom he heart it, where, when, and how often, and in whose presence, making 
separate articles of each of the several points above mentioned. And the 
Notary or scribe shall set down a record of them immediately after the 
aforesaid denunciation; and it shall continue thus:
        This denunciation, as we have said, having been made, the Inquisitor 
himself did at once cause him to swear as above on the four Gospels, etc. 
that he was speaking the truth in his depositions, and did ask him how and 
why he knew or suspected that he what he said was true. He did make answer 
either that he saw, or that he heard. The Inquisitor did then ask him where 
he saw or heard this; and he answered on the — day of the — month in the 
year — in the town or parish of —. He asked him how often he saw or heard 
it, etc. And separate articles shall be made, and the whole set down in 
process, as has been said. And particularly he shall be asked who shared or 
could share in his knowledge of the case.
        When all this has been done, he shall finally be asked whether he 
lays his information out of ill-will, hatred, or rancour; or if he has 
omitted anything through favour or love; of if he has been requested or 
suborned to lay information.
        Finally, he shall be enjoined, by virtue of his oath, to keep secret 
whatever he has said there, or whatever the Judge has said to him; and the 
whole process shall be set down in writing. And when all this is completed, 
it shall be set down a little lower as follows. This was done at such a 
place on the — day of the — month in the year —, in the presence of me the 
Notary or scribe together with those associated with me in the duty of 
writing, and of such and such witnesses summoned and interrogated.
        The third method of beginning a process is the commonest and most 
usual one, because it is secret, and no accuser or informer has to appear. 
But when there is a general report of witchcraft in some town or parish, 
because of this report the Judge may proceed without a general citation or 
admonition as above, since the noise of that report comes often to his ears; 
and then again he can begin a process in the presence of the persons, as we 
have said before. 

In the Name of the Lord. Amen.

        In the year of Our Lord —, on the — day of the — month, to the ears 
of such and such official or judge there came a persistent public report and 
rumour that N. of the town or parish of — did or said such and such a thing 
savouring of witchcraft, against the faith and the common good of the State.
        And the whole shall be set down according to the common report. And 
a little lower:
        The case was heard on the — day of the — month in the year —, in the 
presence of me the Notary of such and such authority, or of such and such a 
scribe, and of such and such witnesses who were called and interrogated.
        But before we proceed to the second Head, which deals with the 
method of conducting this sort of process, we must first say something of 
the witnesses who are to be examined, as to how many they should be, and 
what should be their condition. 




Question II  Of the Number of Witnesses  

        Since we have said that in the second method the evidence of the 
witnesses is to be written down, it is necessary to know how many witnesses 
there should be, and of what condition. The question is whether a Judge may 
lawfully convict any person of the heresy of witchcraft on the evidence of 
two legitimate witnesses whose evidence is entirely concordant, or whether 
more than two are necessary. And we say that the evidence of witnesses is 
not entirely concordant when it is only partially so; that is, when two 
witnesses differ in their accounts, but agree in the substance or effect: as 
when one says “She bewitched my cow,” and the other says, “She bewitched my 
child,” but they agree as to the fact of witchcraft.
        But here we are concerned with the case of two witnesses being in 
entire, not partial, agreement. And the answer is that, although two 
witnesses seem to be enough to satisfy the rigour of law (for the rule is 
that that which is sworn to by two or three is taken for the truth); yet in 
a charge of this kind two witnesses do not seem sufficient to ensure an 
equitable judgement, on account of the heinousness of the crime in question. 
For the proof of an accusation ought to be clearer than daylight; and 
especially ought this to be so in the case of the grave charge of heresy.
        But it may be said that very little proof is required in a charge of 
this nature, since it takes very little argument to expose a person's guilt; 
for it is said in the Canon de Haereticis, lib. II, that a man makes himself 
a heretic if in the least of his opinions he wanders from the teaching and 
the path of the Catholic religion. We answer that this is true enough with 
reference to the presumption that a person is a heretic, but not as regards 
a condemnation. For in a charge of this sort the usual order of judicial 
procedure is cut short, since the defendant does not see the witnesses take 
the oath, nor are they made known to him, because this might expose them to 
grave danger; therefore, according to the statute, the prisoner is not 
permitted to know who are his accusers. But the Judge himself must by virtue 
of his office, inquire into any personal enmity felt by the witnesses 
towards the prisoner; and such witnesses cannot be allowed, as will be shown 
later. And when the witnesses give confused evidence on account of something 
lying on their conscience, the Judge is empowered to put them through a 
second interrogatory. For the less opportunity the prisoner has to defend 
himself, the more carefully and diligently should the Judge conduct his 
inquiry.
        Therefore, although there are two legitimate and concordant 
witnesses against a person, even so I do not allow that this would be 
sufficient warrant for a Judge to condemn a person on so great a charge; but 
if the prisoner is the subject of an evil report, a period should be set for 
his purgation; and if he is under strong suspicion on account of the 
evidence of two witnesses, the Judge should make him abjure the heresy, or 
question him, or defer his sentence. For it does not seem just to condemn a 
man of good name on so great a charge on the evidence of only two witnesses, 
though the case is otherwise with a person of bad reputation. This matter is 
fully dealt with in the Canon Law of heretics, where it is set down that the 
Bishop shall cause three or more men of good standing to give evidence on 
oath to speak the truth as to whether they have any knowledge of the 
existence of heretics in such a parish.
        Again it may be asked whether the Judge can justly condemn a person 
of such heresy only on the evidence of witnesses who in some respects differ 
in their evidence, or merely on the strength of a general accusation. We 
answer that he cannot do so on either of the above grounds. Especially since 
the proofs of a charge ought, as we have said, to be clearer than daylight; 
and in this particular charge no one is to be condemned on merely 
presumptive evidence. Therefore in the case of a prisoner who is the subject 
of a general accusation, a period of purgation shall be set for him; and in 
the case of one who is under strong suspicion arising from the evidence of 
witnesses, he shall be made to abjure his heresy. But when, in spite of 
certain discrepancies, the witnesses agree in the main facts, then the 
matter shall rest with the Judge's discretion; and indirectly the question 
arises how often the witnesses can be examined. 




Question III  Of the Solemn Adjuration and Re-examination of Witnesses  

        But it may be asked whether the Judge can compel witnesses to sweat 
an oath to tell the truth in a case concerning the Faith or witches, of if 
he can examine them many times. We answer that he can do so, especially an 
ecclesiastical Judge, and that in ecclesiastical cases witnesses can be 
compelled to speak the truth, and this on oath, since otherwise their 
evidence would not be valid. For the Canon Law says: The Archbishop or 
Bishop may make a circuit of the parish in which it is rumoured that there 
are heretics, and compel three or more men of good repute, or even, if it 
seems good to him, the whole neighbourhood, to give evidence. And if any 
through damnable obstinacy stubbornly refuse to take the oath, they shall on 
that account be considered as heretics.
        And that the witnesses can be examined several times is shown by the 
Canon, where it says that, when the witnesses have given their evidence in a 
confused manner, or appear to have withheld part of their knowledge for some 
reason, the Judge must take care to examine them afresh; for he may legally 
do so. 




Question IV  Of the Quality and Condition of Witnesses  

        Note that persons under a sentence of excommunication, associates 
and accomplices in the crime, notorious evildoers and criminals, or servants 
giving evidence against their masters, are admitted as witnesses in a case 
concerning the Faith. And just as a heretic may give evidence against a 
heretic, so may a witch against a witch; but this only in default of other 
proofs, and such evidence can only be admitted for the prosecution and not 
for the defence: this is true also of the evidence of the prisoner's wife, 
sons and kindred; for the evidence of such has more weight in proving a 
charge than in disproving it.
        This is made clear in the c. in fidei de haer., where it says: As a 
protection of the faith we allow that in a case of inquiry into the sin of 
heresy, persons under excommunication and partners and accomplices in the 
crime shall be admitted as witnesses, in default of other proofs against 
heretics and their patrons, protectors and defenders; provided that it 
appears probably both from the number of the witnesses and of those against 
whom they give evidence, and from other cicumstances, that they are not 
giving false testimony.
        The case of evidence given by perjurers, when it is presumed that 
they are speaking out of zeal for the faith, is deal with in the Canon c. 
accusatus, § licet, where it says that the evidence of perjurers, after they 
have repented, is admissable; and it goes on to say: If it manifestly 
appears that they do not speak in a spirit of levity, or from motives of 
enmity, or by reason of a bribe, but purely out of zeal for the orthodox 
faith, wishing to correct what they have said, or to reveal something about 
which they had kept silence, in defence of the faith, their testimony shell 
be as valid as that of anyone else, provided that there is no other obection 
to it.
        And it is clear from the same chapter of the Canon that the 
testimony of men or low repute and criminals, and of servants against their 
masters, is admitted; for it says: So great is the plague of heresy that, in 
an action involving this crime, even servants are admitted as witnesses 
against their masters, and any criminal evildoer may give evidence against 
any person soever. 




Question V  Whether Mortal Enemies may be Admitted as Witnesses  

        But if it is asked whether the Judge can admit the mortal enemies of 
the prisoner to give evidence against him in such a case, we answer that he 
cannot; for the same chapter of the Canon says: You must not understand that 
in this kind of charge a mortal personal enemy may be admitted to give 
evidence. Henry of Segusio also makes this quite clear. But it is mortal 
enemies that are spoken of; and it is to be noted that a witness is not 
necessarily to be disqualified because of every sort of enmity. And a mortal 
enmity is constituted by the following circumstances: when there is a death 
feud or vendetta between the parties, or when there has been an attempted 
homicide, or some serious wound or injury which manifestly shows that there 
is mortal hatred on the part of the witness against the prisoner, And in 
such a case it is presumed that, just as the witness has tried to inflict 
temporal death on the prisoner by wounding him, so he will also be willing 
to effect his object by accusing him of heresy; and just as he wished to 
take away his life, so he would be willing to take away his good name. 
Therefore the evidence of such mortal enemies is justly disqualified.
        But there are other serious degrees of enmity (for women are easily 
provoked to hatred), which need not totally disqualify a witness, although 
they render his evidence very doubtful, so that full credence cannot be 
placed in his words unless they are substantiated by independent proofs, and 
other witnesses supply an indubitable proof of them. For the Judge must ask 
the prisoner whether he thinks that he has any enemy who would dare to 
accuse him of that crime out of hatred, so that he might compass his death; 
and if he says that he has, he shall ask who that person is; and then the 
Judge shall take note whether the person named as being likely to give 
evidence from motives of malice has actually done so. And if it is found 
that this is the case, and the Judge has learned from trustworthy men the 
cause of that enmity, and if the evidence in question is not substantiated 
by other proofs and the words of other witnesses, then he may safely reject 
such evidence. But if the prisoner says that he hopes he has no such enemy, 
but admits that he has had quarrels with women; or if he says that he has an 
enemy, but names someone who, perhaps, has not given evidence, in that case, 
even if other witnesses say that such a person has given evidence from 
motives of enmity, the Judge must not reject his evidence, but admit it 
together with the other proofs.
        There are many who are not sufficiently careful and circumspect, and 
consider that the depositions of such quarrelsome women should be altogether 
rejected, saying that no faith can be placed in them, since they are nearly 
always actuated by motives of hatred. Such men are ignorant of the subtlety 
and precautions of magistrates, and speak and judge like men who are colour-
blind. But these precautions are dealt with in Questions XI and XII. 




Question VI  How the Trial is to be Proceeded with and Continued. And how 
the Witnesses are to be Examined in the Presence of Four Other Persons, and 
how the Accused is to be Questioned in Two Ways  

        In considering the method of proceeding with a trial of a witch in 
the cause of faith, it must first be noted that such cases must be conducted 
in the simplest and most summary manner, without the arguments and 
contentions of advocates.
        This is explained in the Canon as follows: It often happens that we 
institute a criminal process, and order it to be conducted in a simple 
straightforward manner without the legal quibbles and contentions which are 
introduced in other cases. Now much doubt had been experienced as to the 
meaning of these words, and as to exactly in what manner such cases should 
be conducted; but we, desiring as far as possible to remove all doubt on the 
matter, sanction the following procedure once and for all as valid: The 
Judge to whom we commit such a case need not require any writ, or demand 
that the action should be contested; he may conduct the case on holidays for 
the sake of the convenience of the public, he should shorten the conduct of 
the case as much as he can by disallowing all dilatory exceptions, appeals 
and obstructions, the impertinent contentions of pleaders and advocates, and 
the quarrels of witnesses, and by restraining the superflous number of 
witnesses; but not in such a way as to neglect the necessary proofs; and we 
do not mean by this that he should omit the citation of and swearing of 
witnesses to tell and not to hide the truth.
        And since, as we have shown, the process is to be conducted in a 
simple manner, and it is initiated either at the instance of an accuser, or 
of an informer actuated by zeal, or by reason of a general outcry and 
rumour; therefore the Judge should try to avoid the first method of 
beginning the action, namely, at the instance of an accusing party. For the 
deeds of witches in conjunction with devils are done in secret, and the 
accuser cannot in this case, as in others, have definite evidence by which 
he can make his statements good; therefore the Judge ought to advise the 
accuser to set aside his formal accusation and to speak rather as an 
informer, because of the grave danger that is incurred by an accuser. And so 
he can proceed in the second manner, which is commonly used, and likewise in 
the third manner, in which the process is begun not at the instance of any 
party.
        It is to be noted that we have already said that the Judge ought 
particularly to ask the informer who shares or could share in his knowledge 
of the case. Accordingly the Judge should call as witnesses those whom the 
informer names, who seem to have most knowledge of the matter, and their 
names shall be entered by the scribe. After this the Judge, having regard to 
the fact that the aforesaid denunciation of heresy involves of its very 
nature such a grave charge that it cannot and must not be lightly passed 
over, since to do so would imply an offence to the Divine Majesty and an 
injury to the Catholic Faith and to the State, shell proceed to inform 
himself and examine the witnesses in the following manner. 

Examination of Witnesses.

        The witness N., of such a place, was called, sworn, and questioned 
whether he knew N. (naming the accused), and answered that he did. Asked how 
he knew him, he answered that he had seen and spoken with him on several 
occasions, or that they had been comrades (so explaining his reason for 
knowing him). Asked for how long he had known him, he answered, for ten or 
for so many years. Asked concerning his reputation, especially in matter 
concerning the faith, he answered that in his morals he was a good (or bad) 
man, but with regard to his faith, there was a report in such a place that 
he used certain practices contrary to the Faith, as a witch. Asked what was 
the report, he made answer. Asked whether he had seen or heard him doing 
such things, he again answered accordingly. Asked where he had heard him use 
such words, he answered, in such a place. Asked in whose presence, he 
answered, in the presence of such and such.
        Further, he was asked whether any of the accused's kindred had 
formerly been burned as witches, or had been suspected, and he answered. 
Asked whether he associated with suspected witches, he answered. Asked 
concerning the manner and reason of the accused's alleged words, he 
answered, for such a reason and in such a manner. Asked whether he thought 
that the prisoner had used those words carelessly, unmeaningly and 
thoughtlessly, or rather with deliberate intention, he answered that he had 
used them jokingly or in temper, or without meaning or believing what he 
said, or else with deliberate intention.
        Asked further how he could distinguish the accused's motive, he 
answered that he knew it because he had spoken with a laugh.
        This is a matter which must be inquired into very diligently; for 
very often people use words quoting someone else, or merely in temper, or as 
a test of the opinions of other people; although sometimes they are used 
assertively with definite intention.
        He was further asked whether he made this deposition out of hatred 
or rancour, or whether he had suppressed anything out of favour or love, and 
he answered, etc. Following this, he as enjoined to preserve secrecy. This 
was done at such a place on such a day in the presence of such witnesses 
called and questioned, and of me the Notary or scribe.
        Here it must always be noted that in such an examination at least 
five persons must be present, namely, the presiding Judge, the witness of 
informer, the respondent or accused, who appears afterwards, and the third 
is the Notary or scribe: where there is no Notary the scribe shall co-opt 
another honest man, and these two, as has been said, shall perform the 
duties of the Notary; and this is provided for by Apostolic authority, as 
was shown above, that in this kind of action two honest men should perform 
as it were the duty of witnesses of the depositions.
        Also it must be noted that when a witness is called he must also be 
sworn, that is, he must take the oath in the manner we have shown; otherwise 
he would falsely be described as called and sworn.
        In the same way the other witnesses are to be examined. And after 
this the Judge shall decide whether the fact is fully proven; and if not 
fully, whether there are great indications and strong suspicions of its 
truth. Observe that we do not speak of a light suspicion, arising from 
slight conjectures, but of a persistent report that the accused has worked 
witchcraft upon children or animals, etc. Then, if the Judge fears the 
escape of the accused, he shall cause him or her to be placed in custody; 
but if he does not fear his escape, he shall have him called for 
examination. But whether or not he places him in custody, he shall first 
cause his house to be searched unexpectedly, and all chests to be opened and 
all boxes in the corners, and all implements of witchcraft which are found 
to be taken away. And having done this, the Judge shall compare together 
everything of which he has been convicted or suspected by the evidence of 
witnesses, and conduct an interrogatory on them, having with him a Notary, 
etc., as above, and having caused the accused to swear by the four Gospels 
of God to speak the truth concerning both himself and others. And they shall 
all be written down in this following manner. 

The General Examination of a Witch or Wizard: and it is the First Action.

        The accused N. of such a place was sworn by personally touching the 
four Gospels of God to speak the truth concerning both himself and others, 
and was then asked whence he was and from where he originated. And he 
answered, from such a place in such a Diocese. Asked who were his parents, 
and whether they were alive or dead, he answered that they were alive in 
such a place, or dead in such a place.
        Asked whether they died a natural death, or were burned, he answered 
in such a way. (Here note that this question is put because, as was shown in 
the Second Part of this work, witches generally offer or devote their own 
children to devils, and commonly their whole progeny is infected; and when 
the informer has deposed to this effect, and the witch herself has denied 
it, it lays her open to suspicion).
        Asked where he was brought up, and where he chiefly lived, he 
answered, in such or such a place. And if it appears that he has changed 
abode because, perhaps, his mother or any of his kindred was not suspected, 
and had lived in foreign districts, especially in such places as are most 
frequented by witches, he shall be questioned accordingly.
        Asked why he had moved from his birthplace and gone to live in such 
or such a place, he answered, for such a reason. Asked whether in those said 
places or elsewhere he had heard any talk of witches, as, for example, the 
stirring up of tempests, the bewitching of cattle, the depriving of cows of 
their milk, or any such matter of which he was accused; if he should answer 
that he had, he must be asked what he had heard, and all that he says must 
be written down. But if he denies it, and says that he has heard nothing, 
then he must be asked whether he believes that there are such things as 
witches, and that such things as were mentioned could be done, as that 
tempests could be raised or men and animals bewitched.
        Not that for the most part witches deny this at first; and therefore 
this engenders a greater suspicion than if they were to answer that they 
left it to a superior judgement to say whether there were such or not. So if 
they deny it, they must be questioned as follows: Then are they innocently 
condemned when they are burned? And he or she must answer. 

The Particular Examination of the Same.

        Let the Judge take care not to delay the following questions, but to 
proceed at once with them. Let he be asked why the common people fear her, 
and whether she knows that she is defamed and hated, and why she had 
threatened such a person, saying, “You shall not cross me with impunity,” 
and let her answers be noted.
        Then let he be asked what harm that person had done her, that she 
should have used such words to threaten him with injury. And note that this 
question is necessary in order to arrive at the cause of their enmity, for 
in the end the accused will allege that the informer has spoken out of 
enmity; but when this is not mortal, but only a womanish quarrel, it is no 
impediment. For this is a common custom of witches, to stir up enmity 
against themselves by some word or action, as, for example, to ask someone 
to lend them something or else they will damage his garden, or something of 
that sort, in order to make an occasion for deeds of witchcraft; and they 
manifest themselves either in word or in action, since they are compelled to 
do so at the instance of the devils, so that in this way the sins of Judges 
are aggravated while the witch remains unpunished.
        For note that they do not do such things in the presence of others, 
so that if the informer wishes to produce witnesses he cannot do so. Note 
again that they are spurred on by the devils, as we have learned from many 
witches who have afterwards been burned; so that often they have to work 
witchcraft against their own wills.
        Further, she was asked how the effect could follow from those 
threats, as that a child or animal should so quickly be bewitched, and she 
answered. Asked, “Why did you say that he would never know a day of health, 
and it was so?” she answered. And if she denies everything, let her be asked 
concerning other bewitchments, alleged by other witnesses, upon cattle or 
children. Asked why she was seen in the fields or in the stable with the 
cattle, and touching them, as is sometimes their custom, she answered.
        Asked why she touched a child, and afterwards it fell sick, she 
answered. Also she was asked what she did in the fields at the time of a 
tempest, and so with many other matters. Again, why, having one or two cows, 
she had more milk than her neighbours who had four or six. Again, let her be 
asked why she persists in a state of adultery or concubinage; for although 
this is beside the point, yet such questions engender more suspicion than 
would the case with a chaste and honest woman who stood accused.
        And not that she is to be continually questioned as to the 
depositions which have been laid against her, to see whether she always 
returns the same answers or not. And when this examination has been 
completed, whether her answers have been negative, or affirmative, or 
ambiguous, let them be written down: Executed in such a place, etc., as 
above. 




Question VII  In Which Various Doubts are Set Forth with Regard to the 
Foregoing Questions and Negative Answers. Whether the Accused is to be 
Imprisoned, and when she is to be considered Manifestly Taken in the Foul 
Heresy of Witchcraft. This is the Second Action  

        It is asked first what is to be done when, as often happens, the 
accused denies everything. We answer that the Judge has three points to 
consider, namely, her bad reputation, the evidence of the fact, and the 
words of the witnesses; and he must see whether all these agree together. 
And if, as very often is the case, they do not altogether agree together, 
since witches are variously accused of different deeds committed in some 
village or town; but the evidences of the fact are visible to the eye, as 
that a child has been harmed by sorcery, or, more often, a beast has been 
bewitched or deprived of its milk; and it a number of witnesses have come 
forward whose evidence, even if it show certain discrepancies (as that one 
should say she had bewitched his child, another his beast, and a third 
should merely witness to her reputation, and so with the others), but 
nevertheless agree in the substance of the fact, that is, as to the 
witchcraft, and that she is suspected of being a witch; although those 
witnesses are not enough to warrant a conviction without the fact of the 
general report, or even with that fact, as was shown above at the end of 
Question III, yet, taken in conjunction with the visible and tangible 
evidence of the fact, the Judge may, in consideration of these three points 
together, decide that the accused is to be reputed, not as strongly or 
gravely under suspicion (which suspicions will be explained later), but as 
manifestly taken in the heresy of witchcraft; provided, that is, that the 
witnesses are of a suitable condition and have not given evidence out of 
enmity, and that a sufficient number of them, say six or eight or ten, have 
agreed together under oath. And then, according to the Canon Law, he must 
subject her to punishment, whether she has confessed her crime or not. And 
this is proved as follows.
        For since it is said, that when all three of the above 
considerations are in agreement, then she should be thought to be manifestly 
taken in heresy, it must not be understood that it is necessary for all 
three to be in agreement, but only that if this is the case the proof is all 
the stronger. For either one instance by itself of the following two 
circumstances, namely, the evidence of the fact and the production of 
legitimate witnesses, is sufficient to cause a person to be reputed as 
manifestly taken in heresy; and all the more when both these considerations 
are in agreement.
        For when the Jurists ask in how many ways a person may be considered 
as manifestly taken in heresy, we answer that there are three ways, as S. 
Bernard has explained. This matter was treated of above in the First 
Question at the beginning of this work, namely, the evidence of the fact, 
when a person has publicly preacher heresy. But here we consider the 
evidence of the fact provided by public threats uttered by the accused, as 
when she said, “You shall have no healthy days,” or some such thing, and the 
threatened effect has followed. The other two ways are the legitimate proof 
of the case by witnesses, and thirdly by her own confession. Therefore, if 
each of these singly is sufficient to cause a person to be manifestly 
suspected, how much more is this the case when the reputation of the 
accused, the evidence of the fact, and the depositions of witnesses all 
together point to the same conclusion. It is true that S. Bernard speaks of 
an evident fact, and we here speak of the evidence of the fact; but this is 
because the devil does not work openly, but secretly. Therefore the injuries 
and the instruments of witchcraft which are found constitute the evidence of 
the fact. And whereas in other heresies an evident fact is alone sufficient, 
here we join three proofs together.
        Secondly, it is thus proved that a person so taken is to be punished 
according to the law, even though she denies the accusation. For a person 
taken on the evidence of the fact, or on the depositions of witnesses, 
either confesses the crime or does not. If he confesses and is impenitent, 
he is to be handed over to the secular courts to suffer the extreme penalty, 
according to the chapter ad abolendam, or he is to be imprisoned for life, 
according to the chapter excommunicamus. But if he does not confess, and 
stoutly maintains his denial, he is to be delivered as an impenitent to the 
power of the Civil Court to be punished in a fitting manner, as Henry of 
Segusio shows in his Summa, where he treats of the manner of proceeding 
against heretics.
        It is therefore concluded that it is most just if the Judge proceeds 
in that manner with his questions and the depositions of witnesses, since, 
as has been said, he can in a case concerning the Faith conduct matters 
quite plainly and in a short and summary manner; and it is meet that he 
should consign the accused to prison for a time, or for several years, in 
case perhaps, being depressed after a year of the squalor of prison, she may 
confess her crimes.
        But, lest it should seem that he arrives at his sentence 
precipitately, and to show that he proceeds with all equity, let us inquire 
into what should next be done. 




Question VIII  Which Follows from the Preceding Question, Whether the Witch 
is to be Imprisoned, and of the Method of Taking her. This is the Third 
Action of the Judge  

        It is asked whether, after she has denied the accusation, the witch 
ought to be kept in custody in prison, when the three aforesaid conditions, 
namely, her reputation, the evidence of the fact, and the depositions of 
witnesses, are in agreement; or whether she should be dismissed with the 
security of sureties, so that she may again be called and questioned. As to 
this question there are three opinions.
        First, it is the opinion of some that she should be sent to prison, 
and that by no means ought she to be dismissed under bond; and they hold 
this opinion on the strength of the reasoning brought forward in the 
preceding question, namely, that she is to be considered as manifestly 
guilty when all those three considerations are in agreement.
        Others, again, think that before she is imprisoned she may be 
dismissed with the safeguard of sureties; so that if she makes her escape, 
she can then be considered as convicted. But after she has been imprisoned 
because of her negative answers, she is not to be released under any 
safeguard or condition of bail, that is, when those three considerations 
noted above are in agreement; because in that case she could not 
subsequently be sentenced and punished by death; and this, they say, is the 
general custom.
        The third opinion is that no definite rule can be given, but that it 
must be left to the Judge to act in accordance with the gravity of the 
matter as shown by the testimony of the witnesses, the reputation of the 
accused, and the evidence as to the fact, and the extent to which these 
three agree with each other; and that he should follow the custom of the 
country. And they who hold this opinion conclude by saying that if reputable 
and responsible sureties are not to be procured, and the accused is 
suspected of contemplating flight, she should then be cast into prison. And 
this third opinion seems to be the most reasonable, as long as the correct 
procedure if observed; and this consists in three things.
        First, that her house should be searched as thoroughly as possible, 
in all holes and corners and chests, top and bottom; and if she is a noted 
witch, then without doubt, unless she has previously hidden them, there will 
be found various instruments of witchcraft, as we have shown above.
        Secondly, if she has a maid-servant or companions, that she or they 
should be shut up by themselves; for though they are not accused, yet it is 
presumed that none of the accused's secrets are hidden from them.
        Thirdly, in taking her, if she be taken in her own house, let her 
not be given time to go into her room; for they are wont to secure in this 
way, and bring away with them, some object or power of witchcraft which 
procures them the faculty of keeping silent under examination.
        This gives rise to the question whether the method employed by some 
to capture a witch is lawful, namely, that she should be lifted from the 
ground by the officers, and carried out in a basket or on a plank of wood so 
that she cannot again touch the ground. This can be answered by the opinion 
of the Canonists and of certain Theologians, that this is lawful in three 
respects. First, because, as is shown in the introductory question of this 
Third Part, it is clear from the opinion of many authorities, and especially 
of such Doctors as no one would dare to dispute, as Duns Scotus, Henry of 
Segusio and Godfrey of Fontaines, that it is lawful to oppose vanity with 
vanity. Also we know from experience and the confessions of witches that 
when they are taken in this manner they more often lose the power of keeping 
silence under examination: indeed many who have been about to be burned have 
asked that they might be allowed at least to touch the ground with one foot; 
and when this has been asked why they made such a request, they have 
answered that if they had touched the ground they would have liberated 
themselves, striking many other people dead with lightning.
        The second reason is this. It was manifestly shown in the Second 
Part of this work that a witch loses all her power when she falls into the 
hands of public justice, that is, with regard to the past; but with regard 
to the future, unless she receives from the devil fresh powers of keeping 
silent, she will confess all her crimes. Therefore let us say with S. Paul: 
Whatsoever we do in word or deed, let all be done in the name of the Lord 
JESUS Christ. And if the witch be innocent, this form of capture will not 
harm her.
        Thirdly, according to the Doctors it is lawful to counteract 
witchcraft by vain means; for they all agree as to this, though they are at 
variance over the question as to when those vain means may also be unlawful. 
Therefore when Henry of Segusio says that it is lawful to oppose vanity with 
vanity, this is explained as meaning that he speaks of vain means, not of 
unlawful means. All the more, then, is it lawful to obstruct witchcraft; and 
it is this obstruction which is referred to here, and not any unlawful 
practice.
        Let the Judge note also that there are two sorts of imprisonment; 
one being a punishment inflicted upon criminals, but the other only a matter 
of custody in the house of detention. And these two sorts are noted in the 
chapter multorum querela; therefore she ought at least to be placed in 
custody. But if it is only a slight matter of which she is accused, and she 
is not of bad reputation, and there is no evidence of her work upon children 
or animals, then she may be sent back to her house. But because she has 
certainly associated with witches and knows their secrets, she must give 
sureties; and if she cannot do so, she must be bound by oaths and penalties 
not to go out of her house unless she is summoned. But her servants and 
domestics, of whom we spoke above, must be kept in custody, yet not 
punished. 




Question IX  What is to be done after the Arrest, and whether the Names of 
the Witnesses should be made Known to the Accused. This is the Fourth Action  

        THERE are two matters to be attended to after the arrest, but it is 
left to the Judge which shall be taken first; namely, the question of 
allowing the accused to be defended, and whether she should be examined in 
the place of torture, though not necessarily in order that she should be 
tortured. The first is only allowed when a direct request is made; the 
second only when her servants and companions, if she has any, have first 
been examined in the house.
        But let us proceed in the order as above. If the accused says that 
she is innocent and falsely accused, and that she wishes to see and hear her 
accusers, then it is a sign that she is asking to defend herself. But it is 
an open question whether the Judge is bound to make the deponents known to 
her and bring them to confront her face to face. For here let the Judge take 
note that he is not bound either to publish the names of the deponents or to 
bring them before the accused, unless they themselves should freely and 
willingly offer to come before the accused and lay their depositions in her 
presence And it is by reason of the danger incurred by the deponents that 
the Judge is not bound to do this. For although different Popes have had 
different opinions on this matter, none of them has ever said that in such a 
case the Judge is bound to make known to the accused the names of the 
informers or accusers (but here we are not dealing with the case of an 
accuser). On the contrary, some have thought that in no case ought he to do 
so, while others have thought that he should in certain circumstances.
        But, finally, Bonifice VIII decreed as follows: If in a case of 
heresy it appear to the Bishop or Inquisitor that grave danger would be 
incurred by the witnesses of informers on account of the powers of the 
persons against whom they lay their depositions, should their names be 
published, he shall not publish them. But if there is no danger, their names 
shall be published just as in other cases.
        Here it is to be noted that this refers not only to a Bishop or 
Inquisitor, but to any Judge conducting a case against witches with the 
consent of the Inquisitor or Bishop; for, as was shown in the introductory 
Question, they can depute their duties to a Judge. So that any such Judge, 
even if he be secular, has the authority of the Pope, and not only of the 
Emperor.
        Also a careful Judge will take notice of the powers of the accused 
persons; for these are of three kinds, namely, the power of birth and 
family, the power of riches, and the power of malice. And the last of these 
is more to be feared than the other two, since it threatens more danger to 
the witnesses if their names are made known to the accused. The reason for 
this is that it is more dangerous to make known the names of the witnesses 
to an accused person who is poor, because such a person has many evil 
accomplices, such as outlaws and homicides, associated with him, who venture 
nothing but their own persons, which is not the case with anyone who is 
nobly born or rich, and abounding in temporal possessions. And the kind of 
danger which is to be feared is explained by Pope John XXII as the death of 
cutting off of themselves or their children or kindred, or the wasting of 
their substance, or some such matter.
        Further, let the Judge take notice that, as he acts in this matter 
with the authority of the Supreme Pontiff and the permission of the 
Ordinary, both he himself and all who are associated with him at the 
depositions, or afterwards at the pronouncing of the sentence, must keep the 
names of the witnesses secret, under pain of excommunication. And it is in 
the power of the Bishop thus to punish him or them if they do otherwise. 
Therefore he should very implicitly warn them not to reveal the name from 
the very beginning of the process.
        Wherefore the above decrees of Pope Bonifice VIII goes on to say: 
And that the danger to those accusers and witnesses may be the more 
effectively met, and the inquiry conducted more cautiously, we permit, by 
the authority of this statute, that the Bishop or Inquisitors (or, as we 
have said, the Judge) shall forbid all those who are concerned in the 
inquiry to reveal without their permission any secrets which they have 
learned from the Bishop or Inquisitors, under pain of excommunication, which 
they may incur by violating such secrets.
        It is further to be noted that just as it is a punishable offence to 
publish the names of witnesses indiscreetly, so also it is to conceal them 
without good reason from, for instance, such people as have a right to know 
them, such as the lawyers and assessors whose opinion is to be sought in 
proceeding to the sentence; in the same way the names must not be concealed 
when it is possible to publish them without risk of any danger to the 
witnesses. On this subject the above decree speaks as follows, towards the 
end: We command that in all cases the Bishop or Inquisitors shall take 
especial care not to suppress the names of the witnesses as if there were 
danger to them when there is perfect security, not conversely to decide to 
publish them when there is some danger threatened, the decision in this 
matter resting with their own conscience and discretion. And it has been 
written in comment on these words: Whoever you are who are a Judge in such a 
case, mark those words well, for they do not refer to a slight risk but to a 
grave danger; therefore do not deprive a prisoner of his legal rights 
without very good cause, for this cannot but be an offence to Almighty God.
        The reader must note that all the process which we have already 
described, and all that we have yet to describe, up to the methods of 
passing sentence (except the death sentence), which it is in the province of 
the ecclesiastical Judge to conduct, can also, with the consent of the 
Diocesans, be conducted by a secular Judge. Therefore the reader need find 
no difficulty in the fact that the above Decree speaks of an ecclesiastical 
and not a secular Judge; for the latter can take his method of inflicting 
the death sentence from that of the Ordinary in passing sentence of penance. 




Question X  What Kind of Defence may be Allowed, and of the Appointment of 
an Advocate. This is the Fifth Action  

        IF, therefore, the accused asked to be defended, how can this be 
admitted when the names of the witnesses are kept altogether secret? It is 
to be said that three considerations are to be observed in admitting any 
defence. First, that an Advocate shall be allotted to the accused. Second, 
that the names of the witnesses shall not be made known to the Advocate, 
even under an oath of secrecy, but that he shall be informed of everything 
contained in the depositions. Third, the accused shall as far as possible be 
given the benefit of every doubt, provided that this involves no scandal to 
the faith nor is in any way detrimental to justice, as will be shown. And in 
like manner the prisoner’s procurator shall have full access to the whole 
process, only the names of the witnesses and deponents being suppressed; and 
the Advocate can act also in the name of procurator.
        As to the first of these points: it should be noted that an Advocate 
is not to be appointed at the desire of the accused, as if he may choose 
which Advocate he will have; but the Judge must take great care to appoint 
neither a litigious nor an evil-minded man, nor yet one who is easily bribed 
(as many are), but rather an honourable man to whom no sort of suspicion 
attaches.
        And the Judge ought to note four points, and if the Advocate be 
found to conform to them, he shall be allowed to plead, but not otherwise. 
For first of all the Advocate must examine the nature of the case, and then 
if he finds it a just one he may undertake it, but if he finds it unjust he 
must refuse it; and he must be very careful not to undertake an unjust or 
desperate case. But if he has unwittingly accepted the brief, together with 
a fee, from someone who wishes to do him an injury, but discovers during the 
process that the case is hopeless, then he must signify to his client (that 
is, the accused) that he abandons the case, and must return the fee which he 
has received. This is the opinion of Godfrey of Fontaines, which is wholly 
in conformity with the Canon de jud. i, rem non novam. But Henry of Segusio 
holds an opposite view concerning the return of the fee in a case in which 
the Advocate has worked very hard. Consequently if an Advocate has wittingly 
undertaken to defend a prisoner whom he knows to be guilty, he shall be 
liable for the costs and expenses (de admin. tut. i, non tamen est ignotum).
        The second point to be observed is that in his pleading he should 
conduct himself properly in three respects. First, his behaviour must be 
modest and free from prolixity or pretentious oratory. Secondly, he must 
abide by the truth, not bringing forward any fallacious arguments or 
reasoning, or calling false witnesses, or introducing legal quirks and 
quibbles if he be a skilled lawyer, or bringing counter-accusations; 
especially in cases of this sort, which must be conducted as simply and 
summarily as possible. Thirdly, his fee must be regulated by the usual 
practice of the district.
        But to return to our point; the Judge must make the above conditions 
clear to the Advocate, and finally admonish him not to incur the charge of 
defending heresy, which would make him liable to excommunication.
        And it is not a valid argument for him to say to the Judge that he 
is not defending the error, but the person. For he must not by any means so 
conduct his defence as to prevent the case from being conducted in a plain 
and summary manner, and he would be doing so if he introduced any 
complications or appeals into it; all which things are disallowed together. 
For it is granted that he does not defend the error; for in that case he 
would be more damnably guilty than the witches themselves, and rather a 
heresiarch than a heretical wizard. Nevertheless, if he unduly defends a 
person already suspect of heresy, he makes himself as it were a patron of 
that heresy, and lays himself under not only a light but a strong suspicion, 
in accordance with the manner of his defence; and ought publicly to abjure 
that heresy before the Bishop.
        We have put this matter at some length, and it is not to be 
neglected by the Judge, because much danger may arise from an improper 
conducting of the defence by an Advocate or Procurator. Therefore, when 
there is any objection to the Advocate, the Judge must dispense with him and 
proceed in accordance with the facts and the proofs. But when the Advocate 
for the accused is not open to any objection, but is a zealous man and lover 
of justice, then the Judge may reveal to him the names of the witnesses, 
under an oath of secrecy. 




Question XI  What Course the Advocate should Adopt when the Names of the 
Witnesses are not Revealed to him. Ths Sixth Action  

        BUT it may be asked: What, then, should the Advocate acting a 
Procurator for the accused do, when the names of the witnesses are withheld 
from both himself and his client, although the accused earnestly desires 
that they should be made known? We answer that he should obtain information 
from the Judge on every point of the accusation, which must be given to him 
at his request, only the names of the witnesses being suppressed; and with 
this information he should approach the accused and, if the matter involves 
a very grave charge, exhort him to exercise all the patience which he can.
        And if the accused again and again insists that she should know the 
names of the witnesses against her, he can answer her as follows: You can 
guess from the charges which are made against you who are the witnesses. For 
the child or beast of so and so has been bewitched; or to such a woman or 
man, because they refused to lend you something for which you asked, you 
said, "You shall know that it would have been better to have agreed to my 
request," and they bear witness that in consequence of your words the person 
was suddenly taken ill; and facts are stronger evidence than words. And you 
know that you have a bad reputation, and have for a long time been suspected 
of casting spells upon and injuring many men. And talking in this manner, he 
may finally induce her to enter a plea that they had borne witness against 
her from motives of hatred; or to say, "I confess that I did say so, but not 
with any intent to do harm."
        Therefore the Advocate must first lay before the Judge and his 
assessors this plea of personal enmity, and the Judge must inquire into it. 
And if it should be found to be a case of mortal enmity, as that there has 
been some attempted or accomplished murder committed by the husbands or 
kindred of the parties, or that someone of one party has been charged with a 
crime by someone of the other party, so that he fell into the hands of 
public justice, or that serious wounds have resulted from quarrels and 
brawls between them; then the upright and careful Judge will consult with 
his assessors whether the accused of the deponent was the aggravating party. 
For if, for example, the husband or friends of the accused have unjustly 
oppressed the friends of the deponent, then if there is no evidence of the 
fact that children or animals or men have been bewitched, and if there are 
no other witnesses, and the accused is not even commonly suspected of 
witchcraft, in that case it is presumed that the depositions were laid 
against her from motives of vengeance, and she is to be discharged as 
innocent and freely dismissed, after having been duly cautioned against 
seeking to avenge herself, in the manner which is usually used by Judges.
        The following case may be put. Katharina’s child, or she herself, is 
bewitched, or she has suffered much loss of her cattle; and she suspects the 
accused because her husband or brothers had previously brought on an unjust 
accusation against her own husband or brother. Here the cause of enmity is 
twofold on the part of the deponent, having its root both in her own 
bewitchment and in the unjust accusation brought against her husband or 
brother. Then ought her deposition to be rejected or not? From one point of 
view it seems that it should, because she is actuated by enmity; from 
another point of view it should not, because there is the evidence of the 
fact in her bewitchment.
        We answer that if in this case there are no other deponents, and the 
accused is not even under common suspicion, then her depositions cannot be 
allowed, but must be rejected; but if the accused is rendered suspect, and 
if the disease is not due to natural causes but to witchcraft (and we shall 
show later how this can be distinguished), she is to be subjected to a 
canonical purgation.
        If it be asked further whether the other deponents must bear witness 
to the evidence of the fact as experienced by themselves or others, or only 
to the public reputation of the accused; we answer that, if they give 
evidence of the fact, so much the better. But if they only give evidence as 
to her general character, and the matter stands so, then, although the Judge 
must reject that deponent on the grounds of personal enmity, yet he shall 
take the evidence of the fact, and of her bad reputation given by the other 
witnesses, as proof that the accused must be strongly suspect, and on these 
grounds he can sentence her to a threefold punishment: namely, to a 
canonical purgation because of her reputation; or to an abjuration, because 
of the suspicion under which she rests, and there are various forms of 
abjuration for various degrees of suspicion, as will be shown in the fourth 
method of passing sentence; or, because of the evidence of the fact, and if 
she confesses her crime and is penitent, she shall not be handed over to the 
secular branch for capital punishment, but be sentenced by the 
ecclesiastical Judge to imprisonment for life. But notwithstanding the fact 
that she has been sentenced to imprisonment for life by the ecclesiastical 
Judge, the secular Judge can, on account of the temporal injuries which she 
has committed, deliver her to be burned. But all these matters will be made 
clear later when we deal with the sixth method of passing sentence.
        To sum up: Let the Judge first take care not to lend too easy belief 
to the Advocate when he pleads mortal enmity on behalf of the accused; for 
in these cases it is very seldom that anyone bears witness without enmity, 
because witches are always hated by everybody. Secondly, let him take note 
that there are four ways by which a witch can be convicted, namely, by 
witnesses, by direct evidence of the fact, and by her own confession. And if 
she is detained on account of a general report, she can be convicted by the 
evidence of witnesses; if on account of definite suspicion, the direct or 
indirect evidence of the facts can convict her, and by reason of these the 
suspicion may be judged to be either light or strong or grave. All this is 
when she does not confess; but when she does, the case can proceeds as has 
been said.
        Thirdly, let the Judge make use of all the foregoing circumstances 
to meet the plea of the Advocate, whether the accused is charged only by 
reason of a general report, or whether there are also certain evidences to 
support the charge by which she incurs slight or strong suspicion; and then 
he will be able to answer the Advocate’s allegation of personal enmity, 
which is the first line of defence which he may assume.
        But when the Advocate assumes the second line of defence, admitting 
that the accused has used such words against the deponent as, "You shall 
soon know what is going to happen to you," or "You will wish soon enough 
that you had lent or sold me what I asked for," or some such words; and 
submits that, although the deponent afterwards experienced some injury 
either to this person or his property, yet it does not follow from this that 
the accused was the cause of it as a witch, for illnesses may be due to 
various different causes. Also he submits that it is a common habit of women 
to quarrel together with such words, etc.
        The Judge ought to answer such allegations in the following manner. 
If the illness is due to natural causes, then the excuse is good. But the 
evidence indicates the contrary; for it cannot be cured by any natural 
remedy; or in the opinion of the physicians the illness is due to 
witchcraft, or is what is in common speech called a Night-scathe. Again, 
perhaps other enchantresses are of the opinion that it is due to witchcraft. 
Or because it came suddenly, without any previous sickening, whereas natural 
diseases generally develop gradually. Or perhaps because the plaintiff had 
found certain instruments of witchcraft under his bed or in his clothes or 
elsewhere, and when these were removed he was suddenly restored to health, 
as often happens, as we showed in the Second Part of this work where we 
treated of remedies. And by some such answer as this the Judge can easily 
meet this allegation, and show that the illness was due rather to witchcraft 
than to any natural causes, and that the accused must be suspected of 
causing such witchcraft, by reason of her threatening words. In the same 
way, if someone said, "I wish your barn would be burned down," and this 
should afterwards happen, it would engender a grave suspicion that the 
person who had used that threat had caused the barn to be set on fire, even 
if another person, and not he himself, had actually set light to it.
