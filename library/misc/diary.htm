DIARIES OF
COURT LADIES OF OLD JAPAN

TRANSLATORS' NOTE
THE poems in the text, slight and occasional as they are, depending
often for their charm on plays upon words of two meanings, or on the
suggestions conveyed to the Japanese mind by a single word, have
presented problems of great difficulty to the translators, not
perfectly overcome. 

Izumi Shikibu's Diary is written with extreme delicacy of
treatment. English words and thought seem too downright a medium into
which to render these evanescent, half-expressed sentences and
poems­vague as the misty mountain scenery of her country, with no
pronouns at all, and without verb inflections. The shy reserve of the
lady's written record has induced the use of the third person as the
best means of suggesting it. 

Of the "Sarashina Diary" there exist a few manuscript copies, and three
or four publications of the text. Some of them are confused and
unreadably incoherent. The present translation was done by comparing
all the texts accessible, and is especially founded on the connected
text by Mr. Sakine, professor of the Girls' Higher Normal School,
Tokio, published by Meiji Shoin, Itchome Nishiki-cho, Kanda-ku,
Tokio. As far as possible the exact meaning has been adhered to, and
the words chosen to express it have been kept absolutely simple,
without complexity of thought, for such is the vocabulary in [Page v]
which it was written. Sometimes the diarist uses the present tense,
sometimes the tense seems reminiscent. The words in square brackets
have been inserted by the translators to complete the sense in English
of sentences which literally rendered do not carry with them the
suggestion of the Japanese text.

INTRODUCTION
BY AMY LOWELL
THE Japanese have a convenient method of calling their historical
periods by the names of the places which were the seats of government
while they lasted. The first of these epochs of real importance is the
Nara Period, which began A.D. 710 and endured until 794; all before
that may be classed as archaic. Previous to the Nara Period, the
Japanese had been a semi-nomadic race. As each successive Mikado came
to the throne, he built himself a new palace, and founded a new
capital; there had been more than sixty capitals before the Nara
Period. Such shifting was not conducive to the development of
literature and the arts, and it was not until a permanent government
was established at Nara that these began to flourish. This is scarcely
the place to trace the history of Japanese literature, but fully to
understand these charming "Diaries of Court Ladies of Old Japan," it is
necessary to know a little of the world they lived in, to be able to
feel their atmosphere and recognize their allusions. 

We know a good deal about Japan today, but the Japan with which we are
familiar only slightly resembles that of the Diaries. Centuries of
feudalism, of "Dark Ages," have come between. We must go behind all
this and begin again. We have all heard of the "Forty-seven Ronins" and
the No Drama, of [Page xii]  Shoguns, Daimios, and Samurais, and many
of us live in daily communion with Japanese prints. It gives us pause
to reflect that the earliest of these things is almost as many
centuries ahead of the Ladies as it is behind us. "Shogun" means simply
"General," and of course there were always generals, but the power of
the Shoguns, and the military feudalism of which the Daimios and their
attendant Samurais were a part, did not really begin until the middle
of the twelfth century and did not reach its full development until the
middle of the fourteenth; the No Drama started with the ancient
religious pantomimic dance, the Kagura, but not until words were added
in the fourteenth century did it become the No; and block colour
printing was first practiced in 1695, while such famous print artists
as Utamaro, Hokusai, and Hiroshige are all products of the eighteenth
or early nineteenth centuries. To find the Ladies behind the dark
military ages, we must go back a long way, even to the century before
their own, and so gain a sort of perspective for them and their time. 

Chinese literature and civilization were introduced into Japan
somewhere between 270 and 310 A.D., and Buddhism followed in 552. Of
course, all such dates must be taken with a certain degree of
latitude; Oriental historians are anything but precise in these
matters. Chinese influence and Buddhism are the two enormous facts to
be reckoned with in understanding Japan, and considering what an effect
they have had, it is not a little singular that Japan has always been
able to preserve her native character. [Page xiii]  To be sure,
Shintoism was never displaced by Buddhism, but the latter made a
tremendous appeal to the Japanese temperament, as the Diaries show. In
fact, it was not until the Meiji Period (1867-1912) that Shintoism was
again made the state religion. With the introduction of Chinese
civilization came the art of writing, when is not accurately known, but
printing from movable blocks followed from Korea in the eighth
century. As was inevitable under the circumstances, Chinese came to be
considered the language of learning. Japanese scholars wrote in
Chinese. All the "serious" books­history, theology, science, law­were
written in Chinese as a matter of course. But, in 712, a volume called
"Records of Ancient Matters" was compiled in the native tongue. It is
the earliest book in Japanese now extant. 

If the scholars wrote in a borrowed language, the poets knew
better. They wrote in their own, and the poetry of the Nara Period has
been preserved for us in an anthology, the "Manyoshu" or "Collection of
One Thousand Leaves." This was followed at the beginning of the tenth
century by the "Kokinshu" ("Ancient and Modern Poems"), to which,
however, the editor, Tsurayuki, felt obliged to write a Chinese
preface. The Ladies of the Diaries were extremely familiar with these
volumes, their own writings are full of allusions to poems contained in
them; Sei-Shonagon, writing early in the eleventh century, describes a
young lady's education as consisting of writing, music, and the twenty
volumes of the [Page xiv]  "Kokinshu." So it came about that while
learned gentlemen still continued to write in Chinese, poetry, fiction,
diaries, and desultory essays called "Zui-hitsu " (Following the
Pen) were written in Japanese. 

Now the position of women at this time was very different from what it
afterwards became in the feudal period. The Chinese called Japan the
"Queen Country," because of the ascendancy which women enjoyed
there. They were educated, they were allowed a share of inheritance,
and they had their own houses. It is an extraordinary and important
fact that much of the best literature of Japan has been written by
women. Three of these most remarkable women are the authors of the
Diaries; a fourth to be named with them, Sei-Shonagon, to whom I have
just referred, was a contemporary. 

In 794, the capital was moved from Nara to Kioto, which was given the
name of "Heian-jo" or "City of Peace," and with the removal, a new
period, the Heian, began. It lasted until 1186, and our Ladies lived in
the very middle of it. 

By this time Japan was thoroughly civilized; she was, indeed, a little
over-civilized, a little too fined down and delicate. At least this is
true of all that life which centred round the court at Kioto. To
historians the Heian Period represents the rise and fall of the
Fujiwara family. This powerful family had served the Mikados from time
out of mind as heads of the Shinto priests, and after the middle of the
seventh century, they became ministers or prime ministers. An immense
clan, they gradually absorbed [Page xv]  all the civil offices in the
Kingdom, while the military offices were filled by the Taira and
Minamoto families. It was the rise of these last as the Fujiwara
declined which eventually led to the rule of the Shoguns and the long
centuries of feudalism and civil war. But in the middle of the Heian
Period the Fujiwara were very much everywhere. Most of those Court
ladies who were the authors of remarkable books were the daughters of
governors of provinces, and that meant Fujiwaras to a greater or lesser
degree. At that time polygamy flourished in Japan, and the family had
grown to a prodigious size. Since a civil office meant a post for a
Fujiwara, many of them were happily provided for, but they were so
numerous that they outnumbered the legitimate positions and others had
to be created to fill the demand. The Court was full of persons of both
sexes holding sinecures, with a great deal of time on their hands and
nothing to do in it but write poetry, which they did exceedingly well,
and attend the various functions prescribed by etiquette. Ceremonials
were many and magnificent, and poetry writing became, not only a game,
but a natural adjunct to every possible event. The Japanese as a nation
are dowered with a rare and exquisite taste, and in the Heian Period
taste was cultivated to an amazing degree. Murasaki Shikibu records the
astounding pitch to which it had reached in a passage in her
diary. Speaking of the Mikado's ladies at a court festivity, she says
of the dress of one of them: "One had a little fault in the colour
combination at the wrist opening. When she went before the Royal [Page
xvi]  presence to fetch something, the nobles and high officials
noticed it. Afterwards Lady Saisho regretted it deeply. It was not so
bad; only one colour was a little too pale." 

That passage needs no comment; it is completely illuminating. It is a
paraphrase of the whole era. 

Kioto was a little city, long one way by some seventeen thousand odd
feet, or about three and a third miles, wide the other by fifteen
thousand, or approximately another three miles, and it is doubtful if
the space within the city wall was ever entirely covered by houses. The
Palace was built in the so-called Azumaya style, a form of architecture
which was also followed in noblemen's houses. The roof, or rather
roofs, for there were many buildings, was covered with bark, and,
inside, the divisions into rooms were made by different sorts of moving
screens. At the period of the Diaries, the reigning Mikado, Ichijo, had
two wives: Sadako, the first queen, was the daughter of a previous
prime minister, Michitaka, a Fujiwara, of course; the other, Akiko,
daughter of Michinaga, the prime minister of the Diaries and a younger
brother of Michitaka, was second queen or Chugu. These queens each
occupied a separate house in the Palace. Kokiden was the name of Queen
Sadako's house; Fujitsubu the name of Queen Akiko's. The rivalry
between these ladies was naturally great, and extended even to their
entourage. Each strove to surround herself with ladies who were not
only beautiful, but learned. The bright star of Queen Sadako's court
was Sei-Shonagon, the author of a [Page xvii]  remarkable book, the
"Makura no Soshi" or "Pillow Sketches," while Murasaki Shikibu held the
same exalted position in Queen Akiko's. 

We are to imagine a court founded upon the Chinese model, but not
nearly so elaborate. A brilliant assemblage of persons all playing
about a restricted but very bright centre. From it, the high officials
went out to be governors of distant provinces, and the lesser ones
followed them to minor posts, but in spite of the distinction of such
positions, distance and the inconvenience of travelling made the going
a sort of laurelled banishment. These gentlemen left Kioto with regret
and returned with satisfaction. But the going, and the years of
residence away, was one of the commonplaces of social life. Fujiwara
though one might be, one often had to wait and scheme for an office,
and the Diaries contain more than one reference to such waiting and the
bitter disappointment when the office was not up to expectation. 

These functionaries travelled with a large train of soldiers and
servants, but, with the best will in the world, these last could not
make the journeys other than tedious and uncomfortable. Still there
were alleviations, because of the very taste of which I have
spoken. The scenery was often beautiful, and whether the traveller were
the Governor himself or his daughter, he noticed and delighted in
it. The "Sarashina Diary" is full of this appreciation of nature. We
are told of "a very beautiful beach with long-drawn white waves," of a
torrent whose water was "white as if thickened with rice flour." We
need only think [Page xviii]  of the prints with which we are familiar
to be convinced of the accuracy of this picture: "The waves of the
outer sea were very high, and we could see them through the pine-trees
which grew scattered over the sandy point which stretched between us
and the sea. They seemed to strike across the ends of the pine branches
and shone like jewels." The diarist goes on to remark that "it was an
interesting sight," which we can very well believe, since certainly she
makes us long to see it. 

These journeys were mostly made on horseback, but there were other
methods of progression, which, however, were probably not always
feasible for long distances. The nobles used various kinds of carriages
drawn by one bullock, and there were also palanquins carried by
bearers. 

It was not only the officials who made journeys, all the world made
them to temples and shrines for the good of their souls. There are
religious yearnings in all the Diaries, and many Mikados and gentlemen
entered the priesthood, Michinaga among them. Sutra recitation and
incantation were ceaselessly performed at Court. We can gain some idea
of the almost fanatical hold which Buddhism had over the educated mind
by the fact that the Fujiwara family built such great temples as
Gokurakuji, Hosohoji, Hokoin, Jomyoji, Muryoju-in, etc. It is recorded
that Mikado Shirakawa, at a date somewhat subsequent to the Diaries,
made pilgrimages four times to Kumano, and during his visits there
"worshipped 5470 painted Buddhas, 127 carved Buddhas sixteen [Page xix]
feet high, 3150 Buddhas life-sized, 2930 carved Buddhas shorter than
three feet, 21 pagodas, 446,630 miniature pagodas." A busy man truly,
but the record does not mention what became of the affairs of state
meanwhile. That this worship was by no means lip-devotion merely, any
reader of the "Sarashina Diary" can see; that it was mixed with much
superstition and a profound belief in dreams is also abundantly
evident. But let us, for a moment, recollect the time. It will place
the marvel of this old, careful civilization before us as nothing else
can. 

To be sure, Greece and Rome had been, but they had passed away, or at
least their greatness had, gone and apparently left no trace. While
these Japanese ladies were writing, Europe was in the full blackness of
her darkest ages. Germany was founding the "Holy Roman Empire of the
German Nation," characteristically founding it with the mailed
fist; Moorish civilization was at its height in Spain; Robert Capet was
king of poor famine-scourged France; Ethelred the Unready was ruling in
England and doing his best to keep off the Danes by payment and
massacre. Later, while the "Sarashina Diary" was being written, King
Canute was sitting in his armchair and giving orders to the
sea. Curious, curious world! So far apart from the one of the
Diaries. And to think that even five hundred years later Columbus was
sending letters into the interior of Cuba, addressed to the Emperor of
Japan! 

These Diaries show us a world extraordinarily like our own, if very
unlike in more than one important [Page xx]  particular. The noblemen
and women of Mikado Ichijo's Court were poets and writers of genius,
their taste as a whole has never been surpassed by any people at any
time, but their scientific knowledge was elementary in the
extreme. Diseases and conflagrations were frequent. In a space of
fifty-one years, the Royal Palace burnt down eleven times. During the
same period, there were four great pestilences, a terrible drought, and
an earthquake. Robbers infested many parts of the country, and were a
constant fear to travellers and pilgrims. Childbirth was very
dangerous. The picture of the birth of a child to Queen Akiko, with
which Murasaki Shikibu's Diary begins, shows us all its bitter
horror. From page to page we share the writer's suspense, and with our
greater knowledge, it is with a sense of wonder that we watch the
queen's return to health. 

But, after all, diseases and conflagrations are seldom more than
episodes in a normal life lived under sane conditions, and it is just
because these Diaries reflect the real life of these three ladies that
they are important. The world they portray is in most ways quite as
advanced as our own, and in some, much more so. Rice was the staple of
food, and although Buddhistic sentiment seldom permitted people to eat
the flesh of animals, they had an abundance of fish which was eaten
boiled, baked, raw, and pickled, and a quantity of fruits and
nuts. There was no sugar, but cakes were made of fruit and nuts, and
there was always rice-wine or saké. Gentlefolk usually dressed in
silk. They wore many layers of coloured garments, [Page xxi]  and
delighted in the harmony produced by the colour combinations of silk
over silk, or of a bright lining subdued by the tone of an outer
robe. The ladies all painted their faces, and the whole toilet was a
matter of sufficient moment to raise it into a fine art. Many of these
lovely dresses are described by Murasaki Shikibu, for instance: "The
beautiful shape of their hair, tied with bands, was like that of the
beauties in Chinese pictures. Lady Saemon held the King's sword. She
wore a blue-green patternless karaginu and shaded train with floating
bands and belt of 'floating thread' brocade dyed in dull red. Her outer
robe was trimmed with five folds and was chrysanthemum coloured. The
glossy silk was of crimson; her figure and movement, when we caught a
glimpse of it, was flower-like and dignified. Lady Ben-no-Naishi held
the box of the King's seals. Her uchigi was grape-coloured. She is a
very small and smile-giving person and seemed shy and I was sorry for
her.... Her hair bands were blue-green. Her appearance suggested one of
the ancient dream-maidens descended from heaven." A little later she
tells us that "the beaten stuffs were like the mingling of dark and
light maple leaves in Autumn"; and, describing in some detail the
festivity at which these ladies appeared, she makes the comment that
"only the right body-guard wore clothes of shrimp pink." To one in love
with colour, these passages leave a very nostalgia for the bright and
sophisticated Court where such things could be. 

And everywhere, everywhere, there is poetry. A [Page xxii]  gentleman
hands a lady a poem on the end of his fan and she is expected to reply
in kind within the instant. Poems form an important part in the ritual
of betrothal. A daughter of good family never allowed herself to be
seen by men (a custom which appears to have admitted many
exceptions). A man would write a poetical love-letter to the lady of
his choice which she must answer amiably, even should she have no mind
to him. If, however, she were happily inclined, he would visit her
secretly at night and leave before daybreak. He would then write again,
following which she would give a banquet and introduce him to her
family. After this, he could visit her openly, although she would still
remain for some time in her father's house. This custom of love-letter
writing and visiting is shown in Izumi Shikibu's Diary. Obviously the
poems were short, and here, in order to understand those in the text,
it may be well to consider for a moment in what Japanese poetry
consists. 

Japanese is a syllabic language like our own, but, unlike our own, it
is not accented. Also, every syllable ends with a vowel, the
consequence being that there are only five rhymes in the whole
language. Since the employment of so restricted a rhyme scheme would be
unbearably monotonous, the Japanese hit upon the happy idea of counting
syllables. Our metrical verse also counts syllables, but we combine
them into different kinds of accented feet. Without accent, this was
not possible, so the Japanese poet limits their number and uses them in
a pattern of alternating lines. His prosody is based upon the numbers
five and seven, a [Page xxiii]  five-syllable line alternating with one
of seven syllables, with, in some forms, two seven-syllable lines
together at the end of a period, in the manner of our couplet. The
favourite form, the "tanka," is in thirty-one syllables, and runs five,
seven, five, seven, seven. There is a longer form, the "naga-uta," but
it has never been held in as high favour. The poems in the Diaries are
all tankas in the original. It can be seen that much cannot be said in
so confined a medium, but much can be suggested, and it is just in this
art of suggestion that the Japanese excel. The "hokku" is an even
briefer form. In it, the concluding hemistich of the tanka is left off,
and it is just in his hemistich that the meaning of the poem is brought
out, so that the hokku is a mere essence, a whiff of an idea to be
created in full by the hearer. But the hokku was not invented until the
fifteenth century; before that, the tanka, in spite of occasional
attempts to vary it by adding more lines, changing their order, using
the pattern in combination as a series of stanzas, etc., reigned
practically supreme, and it is still the chief classic form for all
Japanese poetry. 

Having briefly washed in the background of the Diaries, we must notice,
for a moment, the three remarkable ladies who are the foreground. 

Murasaki Shikibu was the daughter of Fujiwara Tametoki, a scion of a
junior branch of the famous family. She was born in 978. Murasaki was
not her real name, which was apparently To Shikibu (Shikibu is a
title) derived from that of her father. There are two legends about the
reason for her receiving the [Page xxiv]  name Murasaki. One is that
she was given it in playful allusion to her own heroine in the "Genji
Monogatari," who was called Murasaki. The other legend is more
charming. It seems that her mother was one of the nurses of Mikado
Ichijo, who was so fond of her that he gave her daughter this name, in
reference to a well-known poem: 

"When the purple grass (Murasaki) is in full colour,
One can scarcely perceive the other plants in the field." 
From the Murasaki grass, the word has come to mean a colour which
includes all the shades of purple, violet, and lavender. In 996, or
thereabouts, she accompanied her father to the Province of Echizen, of
which he had become governor. A year later, she returned to Kioto, and,
within a twelvemonth, married another Fujiwara, Nobutaka. The marriage
seems to have been most happy, to judge from the constant expressions
of grief in her Diary for her husband's death, which occurred in 1001,
a year in which Japan suffered from a great pestilence. A daughter was
born to them in 1000. From her husband's death, until 1005, she seems
to have lived in the country, but in this year she joined the Court as
one of Queen Akiko's ladies; before that, however (and again I must
insist that these early dates are far from determined), she had made
herself famous, not only for her own time, but for all time, by writing
the first realistic novel of Japan. This book is the "Genji
Monogatari" or "Narrative of Genji." 
Hitherto, Japanese authors had confined them- [Page xxv]  selves to
stories of no great length, and which relied for their interest on a
fairy or wonder element. The "Genji Monogatari" struck out an entirely
new direction. It depicted real life in Kioto as a contemporary
gentleman might have lived it. It founded its interest on the fact that
people like to read about themselves, but this, which seems to us a
commonplace, was a glaring innovation when Murasaki Shikibu attempted
it; it was, in fact, the flash from a mind of genius. The book follows
the life of Prince Genji from his birth to his death at the age of
fifty-one, and the concluding books of the series pursue the career of
one of his sons. It is an enormous work, comprising no less than
fifty-four books and running to over four thousand pages­the
genealogical tree of the personages alone is eighty pages long­but no
reader of the Diary will need to be convinced that the "Genji" is not
merely sprightly and captivating, but powerful as well. The lady was
shrewd, and if she were also kindly and very attractive, nevertheless
she saw with an uncompromising eye. Her critical faculty never sleeps,
and takes in the minutest detail of anything she sees, noting
unerringly every little rightness and wrongness connected with it. She
watches the approach of the Mikado, and touches the matter so that we
get its exact shade: "When the Royal palanquin drew near, the bearers,
though they were rather honourable persons, bent their heads in
absolute humility as they ascended the steps. Even in the highest
society there are grades of courtesy, but these men were too
humble." [Page xxvi]  

No one with such a gift can fail to be lonely, and Murasaki Shikibu
seems very lonely, but it is not the passionate rebellion of Izumi
Shikibu, nor the abiding melancholy of the author of the "Sarashina
Diary"; rather is it the disillusion of one who has seen much of the
world, and knows how little companionship she may expect ever to
find: "It is useless to talk with those who do not understand one and
troublesome to talk with those who criticize from a feeling of
superiority. Especially one-sided persons are troublesome. Few are
accomplished in many arts and most cling narrowly to their own
opinion." 

I have already shown Murasaki Shikibu's beautiful taste in dress, but
indeed it is in everything. When she says "The garden [on a moonlight
night] was admirable," we know that it must have been of an
extraordinary perfection. 

The Diary proves her dramatic sense, as the "Genji" would also do could
it find so sympathetic a translator. No wonder, then, that it leapt
into instant fame. There is a pretty legend of her writing the book at
the Temple of Ishiyama at the southern end of Lake Biwa. The tale gains
verisimilitude in the eyes of visitors by the fact that they are shown
the chamber in the temple in which she wrote and the ink-slab she used,
but, alas! it is not true. We do not know where she wrote, nor even
exactly when. The "Genji" is supposed to have been begun in 1002, and
most commentators believe it to have been finished in 1004. That she
should have been called to Court in the following year, seems extremely
natural. Queen Akiko [Page xxvii]  must have counted herself most
fortunate in having among her ladies so famous a person. 

The Diary tells the rest, the Diary which was begun in 1007. We know no
more of Murasaki Shikibu except that no shade of scandal ever tinged
her name. 

One of the strangest and most interesting things about the Diaries is
that their authors were such very different kinds of people. Izumi
Shikibu is as unlike Murasaki Shikibu as could well happen. As
different as the most celebrated poet of her time is likely to be from
the most celebrated novelist, for Izumi Shikibu is the greatest woman
poet which Japan has had. The author of seven volumes of poems, this
Diary is the only prose writing of hers which is known. It is an
intimate account of a love affair which seems to have been more than
usually passionate and pathetic. Passionate, provocative, enchanting,
it is evident that Izumi Shikibu could never have been the
discriminating observer, the critic of manners, which Murasaki Shikibu
became. Life was powerless to mellow so vivid a personality; but
neither could it subdue it. She gives us no suggestion of
resignation. She lived intensely, as her Diary shows; she always had
done so, and doubtless she always did. We see her as untamable, a
genius compelled to follow her inclinations. Difficult to deal with,
maybe, like strong wine, but wonderfully stimulating. 

Izumi Shikibu was born in 974. She was the eldest daughter of Oe
Masamune, another Governor of Echizen. In 995, she married Tachibana
Michisada, Governor of Izumi, hence her name. From this gentle- [Page
xxviii]  man she was divorced, but just when we do not know, and he
died shortly after, probably during the great pestilence which played
such havoc throughout Japan and in which Murasaki Shikibu's husband had
also died. Her daughter, who followed in her mother's footsteps as a
poet, had been born in 997. But Izumi Shikibu was too fascinating and
too petulant to nurse her disappointment in a chaste seclusion. She
became the mistress of Prince Tametaka, who also died in 1002. It is
very soon after this event that the Diary begins. Her new lover was
Prince Atsumichi, and the Diary seems to have been written solely to
appease her mind, and to record the poems which passed between them and
which Izumi Shikibu evidently regarded as the very essence of their
souls. 

In the beginning, the affair was carried on with the utmost secrecy,
but clandestine meetings could not satisfy the lovers, and at last the
Prince persuaded her to take up her residence in the South Palace as
one of his ladies. Considering the manners of the time, it is a little
puzzling to see why there should have been such an outcry at this, but
outcry there certainly was. The Princess took violent umbrage at the
Prince's proceeding and left the Palace on a long visit to her
relations. So violent grew the protestations in the little world of the
Court that, in 1004, Izumi Shikibu left the Palace and separated
herself entirely from the Prince. It was probably to emphasize the
definiteness of the separation that, immediately after her departure,
she married Fujiwara Yasumasa, Governor of Tango, and left with him for
that Province in 1005. [Page xxix]  The facts bear out this
supposition, but we do not know it from her own lips, as the Diary
breaks off soon after she reaches the South Palace. 

In 1008, she was summoned back to Kioto to serve the Queen in the same
Court where Murasaki Shikibu had been since 1005. Whatever effect the
scandal may have had four years earlier, her receiving the post of
lady-in-waiting proves it to have been worth forgetting in view of her
fame, and Queen Akiko must have rejoiced to add this celebrated poet to
her already remarkable bevy of ladies. Of course there was jealousy­who
can doubt it? No reader of the Diaries can imagine that Izumi Shikibu
and Murasaki Shikibu can have been sympathetic, and we must take with a
grain of salt the latter's caustic comment: "Lady Izumi Shikibu
corresponds charmingly, but her behavior is improper indeed. She writes
with grace and ease and a flashing wit. There is a fragrance even in
her smallest words. Her poems are attractive, but they are only
improvisations which drop from her mouth spontaneously. Every one of
them has some interesting point, and she is acquainted with ancient
literature also, but she is not like a true artist who is filled with
the genuine spirit of poetry. Yet I think even she cannot presume to
pass judgment on the poems of others." Is it possible that Izumi
Shikibu had been so rash as to pass judgment on some of Murasaki
Shikibu's efforts? 

Of course it is beyond the power of any translation to preserve the
full effect of the original, but even in translation, Izumi Shikibu's
poems are singularly [Page xxx]  beautiful and appealing. In her own
country, they are considered never to have been excelled in freshness
and freedom of expression. There is something infinitely sad in this,
which she is said to have written on her death-bed, as the end of a
passionate life: 

"Out of the dark,
Into a dark path
I now must enter:
Shine [on me] from afar
Moon of the mountain fringe." 1 
In Japanese poetry, Amita-Buddha is often compared to the moon which
rises over the mountains and lights the traveller's path. 

Very different again is the lady who wrote the "Sarashina Diary," and
it is a very different kind of record. Murasaki Shikibu's Diary is
concerned with a few years of her life, Izumi Shikibu's with one
episode only of hers, but the "Sarashina Diary" covers a long period in
the life of its author. The first part was written when she was twelve
years old, the last entry was made when she was past fifty. It begins
with a journey from Shimosa to Kioto by the Tokaido in 1021, which is
followed by a second journey some years later from Kioto to Sarashina,
a place which has never been satisfactorily identified, although some
critics have supposed it to have been in the Province of Shinano. The
rest of the Diary consists of jottings at various times, accounts of
books read, of places seen, of pilgrimages to temples, of records of
dreams and portents, of communings with [Page xxxi]  herself on life
and death, of expressions of resignation and sorrow. 

The book takes its name from the second of the journeys, "Sarashina
Nikki," meaning simply "Sarashina Diary," for, strangely enough, we do
not know the author's name. We do know, however, that she was the
daughter of Fujiwara Takasué, and that she was born in 1009. In 1017,
Takasué was appointed governor of a province, and went with his
daughter to his new post. It is the return journey, made in 1021, with
which the Diary opens. 

Takasué's daughter shared with so many of her contemporaries the deep
love of nature and the power to express this love in words. I have
already quoted one or two of her entries on this journey. We follow the
little company over mountains and across rivers, we camp with them by
night, and tremble as they trembled lest robbers should attack them. We
see what the little girl saw: "The mountain range called Nishitomi is
like folding screens with good pictures," "people say that purple grass
grows in the fields of Mushashi, but it is only a waste of various
kinds of reeds, which grow so high that we cannot see the bows of our
horsemen who are forcing their way through the tall grass," and share
her disappointment when she says: "We passed a place called 'Eight
Bridges,' but it was only a name, no bridge and no pretty sight." 

They reach Kioto and a rather dull life begins, enlivened only by the
avid reading of romances, among them the "Genji Monogatari." Then her
sister dies [Page xxxii]  giving birth to a child, and the life
becomes, not only dull, but sorrowful. After a time, the lady obtains a
position at Court, but neither her bringing up nor her disposition had
suited her for such a place. She mentions that "Mother was a person of
extremely antiquated mind," and it is evident that she had been taught
to look inward rather than outward. An abortive little love affair
lightens her dreariness for a moment. Life had dealt hardly with the
sensitive girl, from year to year she grows more wistful, but suddenly
something happens, a mere hint of a gleam, but opening a possibility of
brightness. Who he was, we do not know, but she met him on an evening
when "there was no starlight, and a gentle shower fell in the
darkness." They talked and exchanged poems, but she did not meet him
again until the next year; then, after an evening entertainment to
which she had not gone, "when I looked out, opening the sliding door on
the corridor, I saw the morning moon very faint and beautiful," and he
was there. Again they exchanged poems and she believed that happiness
had at last arrived. He was to come with his lute and sing to her. "I
wanted to hear it," she writes, "and waited for the fit occasion, but
there was none, ever." A year later she has lost hope, she writes a
poem and adds, "So I composed that poem­and there is nothing more to
tell." Nothing more, indeed, but what is told conveys all the misery of
her deceived longing. 

The last part of the Diary is concerned chiefly with accounts of
pilgrimages and dreams. She mar- [Page xxxiii]  ried, who and when is
not recorded, and bore children. Her husband dies, and with his death
the spring of her life seems to have run down. Her last entry is very
sad: "My people went to live elsewhere and I lived alone in my solitary
home." So we leave her "a beautiful, shy spirit whose life had known
much sorrow."

DIARIES OF
COURT LADIES OF OLD JAPAN
I
THE SARASHINA DIARY
A.D. 1009-1059
I WAS brought up in a distant province 1 which lies farther than the
farthest end of the Eastern Road. I am ashamed to think that
inhabitants of the Royal City will think me an uncultured girl. 

Somehow I came to know that there are such things as romances in the
world and wished to read them. When there was nothing to do by day or
at night, one tale or another was told me by my elder sister or
stepmother, and I heard several chapters about the shining Prince
Genji. 2 My longing for such stories increased, but how could they
recite them all from memory? I became very restless and got an image of
Yakushi Buddha 3 made as large as myself. When I was alone I washed my
hands and went secretly before the altar and prayed to him with all my
life, bowing my head down to the floor. "Please [Page 4]  let me go to
the Royal City. There I can find many tales. Let me read all of them." 

When thirteen years old, I was taken to the Royal City. On the third of
the Long-moon month, 1 I removed [from my house] to Imataté, the old
house where I had played as a child being broken up. At sunset in the
foggy twilight, just as I was getting into the palanquin, I thought of
the Buddha before which I had gone secretly to pray­I was sorry and
secretly shed tears to leave him behind. 

Outside of my new house [a rude temporary, thatched one] there is no
fence nor even shutters, but we have hung curtains and sudaré. 2 From
that house, standing on a low bluff, a wide plain extends towards the
South. On the East and West the sea creeps close, so it is an
interesting place. When fogs are falling it is so charming that I rise
early every morning to see them. Sorry to leave this place. 

On the fifteenth, in heavy dark rain, we crossed the boundary of the
Province and lodged at Ikada in the Province of Shimofusa. Our lodging
is almost submerged. I am so afraid I cannot sleep. I see only three
lone trees standing on a little hill in the waste. 

The next day was passed in drying our dripping clothes and waiting for
the others to come up. 3 [Page 5]  

On the seventeenth, started early in the morning, and crossed a deep
river. I heard that in this Province there lived in olden times a
chieftain of Mano. He had thousand and ten thousand webs of cloth woven
and dipped them [for bleaching] in the river which now flows over the
place where his great house stood. Four of the large gate-posts
remained standing in the river. 

Hearing the people composing poems about this place, I in my mind: 

Had I not seen erect in the river
These solid timbers of the olden time
How could I know, how could I feel
The story of that house?

That evening we lodged at the beach of Kurodo. The white sand stretched
far and wide. The pinewood was dark­the moon was bright, and the soft
blowing of the wind made me lonely. People were pleased and composed
poems. My poem: 

For this night only
The autumn moon at Kurodo beach shall shine for me,
For this night only!­I cannot sleep.

Early in the morning we left this place and came to the Futoi River 1
on the boundary between Shimofusa and Musashi. We lodged at the ferry
of Matsusato 2 near Kagami's rapids,3 and all night long our luggage
was being carried over. [Page 6]  

My nurse had lost her husband and gave birth to her child at the
boundary of the Province, so we had to go up to the Royal City
separately. I was longing for my nurse and wanted to go to see her, and
was brought there by my elder brother in his arms. We, though in a
temporary lodging, covered ourselves with warm cotton batting, but my
nurse, as there was no man to take care of her, was lying in a wild
place [and] covered only with coarse matting. She was in her red dress. 

The moon came in, lighting up everything, and in the moonlight she
looked transparent. I thought her very white and pure. She wept and
caressed me, and I was loath to leave her. Even when I went with
lingering heart, her image remained with me, and there was no interest
in the changing scenes. 

The next morning we crossed the river in a ferryboat in our
palanquins. The persons who had come with us thus far in their own
conveyances went back from this place. We, who were going up to the
Royal City, stayed here for a while to follow them with our eyes; and
as it was a parting for life all wept. Even my childish heart felt
sorrow. 

Now it is the Province of Musashi. There is no charm in this place. The
sand of the beaches is not white, but like mud. People say that purple
grass 1 grows in the fields of Musashi, but it is only a waste of
various kinds of reeds, which grow so high that we cannot see the bows
of our horsemen who are forcing their way through the tall grass. Going
through [Page 7]  these reeds I saw a ruined temple called
Takeshíba-dera. There were also the foundation-stones of a house with
corridor. 

"What place is it?" I asked; and they answered: 

"Once upon a time there lived a reckless adventurer at Takeshiba. 1 He
was offered to the King's palace [by the Governor] as a guard to keep
the watch-fire. He was once sweeping the garden in front of a
Princess's room and singing: 

Ah, me! Ah, me! My weary doom to labour here in the Palace! 
Seven good wine-jars have I­and three in my province.
There where they stand I have hung straight-stemmed gourds of the
finest­
  They turn to the West when the East wind blows,
  They turn to the East when the West wind blows,
  They turn to the North when the South wind blows,
  They turn to the South when the North wind blows. 
And there I sit watching them turning and turning forever­
  Oh, my gourds! Oh, my wine-jars!

"He was singing thus alone, but just then a Princess, the King's
favourite daughter, was sitting alone behind the misu. 2 She came
forward, and, leaning against the doorpost, listened to the man
singing. She was very interested to think how gourds were above the
wine-jars and how they were turning and wanted to see them. She became
very zealous for the gourds, and pushing up the blind called the guard,
saying, 'Man, come here!' The man heard it very respectfully, and [Page
8]  with great reverence drew near the balustrade. 'Let me hear once
more what you have been saying.' And he sang again about his
wine-jars. 'I must go and see them, I have my own reason for saying
so,' said the Princess. 

"He felt great awe, but he made up his mind, and went down towards the
Eastern Province. He feared that men would pursue them, and that night,
placing the Princess on the Seta Bridge, 1 broke a part of it away, and
bounding over with the Princess on his back arrived at his native place
after seven days' and seven nights' journey. 

"The King and Queen were greatly surprised when they found the Princess
was lost, and began to search for her. Some one said that a King's
guard from the Province of Musashi, carrying something of exquisite
fragrance 2 on his back, had been seen fleeing towards the East. So
they sought for that guard, and he was not to be found. They said,
'Doubtless this man went back home.' The Royal Government sent
messengers to pursue them, but when they got to the Seta Bridge they
found it broken, and they could not go farther. In the Third month,
however, the messengers arrived at Musashi Province and sought for the
man. The Princess gave audience to the messengers and said: 

"'I, for some reason, yearned for this man's home and bade him carry me
here; so he has carried me. If [Page 9]  this man were punished and
killed, what should I do? This is a very good place to live in. It must
have been settled before I was born that I should leave my trace
[i.e. descendants] in this Province­go back and tell the King so.' So
the messenger could not refuse her, and went back to tell the King
about it. 

"The King said: 'It is hopeless. Though I punish the man I cannot bring
back the Princess; nor is it meet to bring them back to the Royal
City. As long as that man of Takeshiba lives I cannot give Musashi
Province to him, but I will entrust it to the Princess.' 

"In this way it happened that a palace was built there in the same
style as the Royal Palace and the Princess was placed there. When she
died they made it into a temple called Takeshíba-dera. 1 The
descendants of the Princess received the family name of Musashi. After
that the guards of the watch-fire were women." 2 

We went through a waste of reeds of various kinds, forcing our way
through the tall grass. There is the river Asuda along the border of
Musashi and Sagami, where at the ferry Arihara Narihira had composed
his famous poem. 3 In the book of his poetical works the river is
called the river Sumida. [Page 10]  

We crossed it in a boat, and it is the Province of Sagami. The mountain
range called Nishitomi is like folding screens with good pictures. On
the left hand we saw a very beautiful beach with long-drawn curves of
white waves. There was a place there called Moro-koshi-ga-Hara 1
[Chinese Field] where sands are wonderfully white. Two or three days we
journeyed along that shore. A man said: "In Summer pale and deep
Japanese pinks bloom there and make the field like brocade. As it is
Autumn now we cannot see them." But I saw some pinks scattered about
blooming pitiably. They said: "It is funny that Japanese pinks are
blooming in the Chinese field." 

There is a mountain called Ashigara [Hakoné] which extends for ten and
more miles and is covered with thick woods even to its base. We could
have only an occasional glimpse of the sky. We lodged in a hut at the
foot of the mountain. It was a dark moonless [Page 11]  night. I felt
myself swallowed up and lost in the darkness, when three singers came
from somewhere. One was about fifty years old, the second twenty, and
the third about fourteen or fifteen. We set them down in front of our
lodging and a karakasa [large paper umbrella] was spread for them. My
servant lighted a fire so that we saw them. They said that they were
the descendants of a famous singer called Kobata. They had very long
hair which hung over their foreheads; their faces were white and clean,
and they seemed rather like maids serving in noblemen's families. They
had clear, sweet voices, and their beautiful singing seemed to reach
the heavens. All were charmed, and taking great interest made them come
nearer. Some one said, "The singers of the Western Provinces are
inferior to them," and at this the singers closed their song with the
words, " if we are compared with those of Naniwa" [Osaka]. 1 They were
pretty and neatly dressed, with voices of rare beauty, and they were
wandering away into this fearful mountain. Even tears came to those
eyes which followed them as far as they could be seen; and my childish
heart was unwilling to leave this rude shelter frequented by these
singers. 

Next morning we crossed over the mountain. 2 [Page 12]  Words cannot
express my fear 1 in the midst of it. Clouds rolled beneath our
feet. Halfway over there was an open space with a few trees. Here we
saw a few leaves of aoi 2 [Asarum caulescens ]. People praised it and
thought strange that in this mountain, so far from the human world, was
growing such a sacred plant. We met with three rivers in the mountain
and crossed them with difficulty. That day we stopped at Sekiyama. Now
we are in Suruga Province. We passed a place called Iwatsubo [rock-urn]
by the barrier of Yokobashiri. There was an indescribably large square
rock through a hole in which very cold water came rushing out. 

Mount Fuji is in this Province. In the Province where I was brought up
[from which she begins this journey] I saw that mountain far towards
the West. It towers up painted with deep blue, and covered with eternal
snow. It seems that it wears a dress of deep violet and a white veil
over its shoulders. From the little level place of the top smoke was
going up. In the evening we even saw burning fires there. 3 The Fuji
River comes tumbling down from that mountain. A man of the Province
came up to us and told us a story. 

"Once I went on an errand. It was a very hot day, and I was resting on
the bank of the stream when I [Page 13]  saw something yellow come
floating down. It came to the bank of the river and stuck there. I
picked it up and found it to be a scrap of yellow paper with words
elegantly written on it in cinnabar. Wondering much I read it. On the
paper was a prophecy of the Governors [of provinces] to be appointed
next year. As to this Province there were written the names of two
Governors. I wondered more and more, and drying the paper, kept
it. When the day of the announcement came, this paper held no mistake,
and the man who became the Governor of this Province died after three
months, and the other succeeded him." 

There are such things. I think that the gods assemble there on that
mountain to settle the affairs of each new year. 

At Kiyomigaseki, where we saw the sea on the left, there were many
houses for the keepers of the barriers. Some of the palisades went even
into the sea. 

At Tagonoura waves were high. From there we went along by boat. We went
with ease over Numajiri and came to the river Oi. Such a torrent I have
never seen. Water, white as if thickened with rice flour, ran fast. 

I became ill, and now it is the Province of Totomi. I had almost lost
consciousness when I crossed the mountain pass of Sayo-no-Nakayama [the
middle mountain of the little night]. I was quite exhausted, so when we
came to the bank of the Tenryu River, we had a temporary dwelling
built, and passed several days there, and I got better. As the winter
was [Page 14]  already advanced, the wind from the river blew hard and
it became intolerable. After crossing the river we went towards the
bridge at Hamana. 

When we had gone down towards the East [four years before when her
father had been appointed Governor] there had been a log bridge, but
this time we could not find even a trace of it, so we had to cross in a
boat. The bridge had been laid across an inland bay. The waves of the
outer sea were very high, and we could see them through the thick
pine-trees which grew scattered over the sandy point which stretched
between us and the sea. They seemed to strike across the ends of the
pine branches and shone like jewels. It was an interesting sight. 

We went forward and crossed over Inohana­an unspeakably weary ascent it
was­and then came to Takashi shore of the Province of Mikawa. We passed
a place called "Eight-Bridges," but it was only a name, no bridge and
no pretty sight. 

In the mountain of Futamura we made our camp under a big persimmon
tree. The fruit fell down during the night over our camps and people
picked it up. 

We passed Mount Miyaji, where we saw red leaves still, although it was
the first day of the Tenth month. 

Furious mountain winds in their passing 
       must spare this spot
For red maple leaves are clinging 
       even yet to the branch. 
There was a fort of "If-I-can" between Mikawa and Owari. It is amusing
to think how difficult the [Page 15]  crossing was, indeed. We passed
the Narumi [sounding-sea] shore in the Province of Owari. The evening
tides were coming in, and we thought if they came higher we could not
cross. So in a panic we ran as fast as we could. 

At the border of Mino we crossed a ferry called Kuromata, and arrived
at Nogami. There singers came again and they sang all night. Lovingly
we thought of the singers of Ashigara. 

Snow came, and in the storm we passed the barrier at Fuha, and over the
Mount Atsumi, having no heart to look at beautiful sights. In the
Province of Omi we stayed four or five days in a house at Okinaga. At
the foot of Mitsusaka Mountain light rain fell night and day mixed with
hail. It was so melancholy that we left there and passed by Inugami,
Kanzaki, and Yasu without receiving any impressions. The lake stretched
far and wide, and we caught occasional glimpses of Nadeshima and
Chikubushima [islands]. It was a very pretty sight. We had great
difficulty at the bridge of Seta, for it had fallen in. We stopped at
Awazu, and arrived at the Royal City after dark on the second day of
the Finishing month. 

When we were near the barrier I saw the face of a roughly hewn Buddha
sixteen feet high which towered over a rude fence. Serene and
indifferent to its surroundings it stood unregarded in this deserted
place; but I, passing by, received a message from it. Among so many
provinces [through which I have passed] the barriers at Kiyomigata and
Osaka were far better than the others. [Page 16]  

It was dark when I arrived at the residence on the west of the Princess
of Sanjo's mansion. 1 Our garden was very wide and wild with great,
fearful trees not inferior to those mountains I had come from. I could
not feel at home, or keep a settled mind. Even then I teased mother
into giving me books of stories, after which I had been yearning for so
many years. Mother sent a messenger with a letter to Emon-no-Myogu, one
of our relatives who served the Princess of Sanjo. She took interest in
my strange passion and willingly sent me some excellent manuscripts in
the lid of a writing-box, 2 saying that these copies had been given her
by the Princess. My joy knew no bounds and I read them day and night; I
soon began to wish for more, but as I was an utter stranger to the
Royal City, who would get them for me? 

My stepmother [meaning one of her father's wives] had once been a
lady-in-waiting at the court, and she seemed to have been disappointed
in something. She had been regretting the World [her marriage], and now
she was to leave our home. She beckoned her own child, who was five
years old, and said, "The time will never come when I shall forget you,
dear heart"; and pointing to a huge plum-tree which grew close to the
eaves, said, "When it is in flower I shall come back"; and she went
away. I felt love and pity for her, and while I was secretly weeping,
the year, too, went away. 

[Facing Page]  


"IT WAS ALL IN FLOWER AND YET NO TIDINGS FROM HER."

[Page 17]  

"When the plum-tree blooms I shall come back"­I pondered over these
words and wondered whether it would be so. I waited and waited with my
eye hung to the tree. It was all in flower 1 and yet no tidings from
her. I became very anxious [and at last] broke a branch and sent it to
her [of course with a poem]: 

You gave me words of hope, are they not long delayed?
The plum-tree is remembered by the Spring, 
Though it seemed dead with frost. 
She wrote back affectionate words with a poem: 

Wait on, never forsake your hope, 
For when the plum-tree is in flower 
Even the unpromised, the unexpected, will come to you. 
During the spring [of 1022] the world was disquieted. 2 My nurse, who
had filled my heart with pity on that moonlight night at the ford of
Matsuzato, died on the moon-birthday of the Ever-growing month [first
day of March]. I lamented hopelessly without any way to set my mind at
ease, and even forgot my passion for romances. 

I passed day after day weeping bitterly, and when I first looked out of
doors 3 [again] I saw the evening sun on cherry-blossoms all falling in
confusion [this would mean four weeks later]. [Page 18]  

Flowers are falling, yet I may see them again 
     when Spring returns.
But, oh, my longing for the dear person 
     who has departed from us forever! 
I also heard that the daughter of the First Adviser 1 to the King was
lost [dead]. I could sympathize deeply with the sorrow of her lord, the
Lieutenant-General, for I still felt my own sorrow. 
When I had first arrived at the Capital I had been given a book of the
handwriting of this noble lady for my copy-book. In it were written
several poems, among them the following: 

When you see the smoke floating up the valley of 
      Toribe Hill, 2 
Then you will understand me, who seemed as shadow-like 
      even while living. 
I looked at these poems which were written in such a beautiful
handwriting, and I shed more tears. I sat brooding until mother
troubled herself to console me. She searched for romances and gave them
to me, and I became consoled unconsciously. I read a few volumes of
Genji-monogatari and longed for the rest, but as I was still a stranger
here I had no way of finding them. I was all impatience and yearning,
and in my mind was always praying that I might read all the books of
Genji-monogatari from the very first one. 

While my parents were shutting themselves up in Udzu-Masa 3 Temple, I
asked them for nothing ex- [Page 19]  cept this romance, wishing to
read it as soon as I could get it, but all in vain. I was
inconsolable. One day I visited my aunt, who had recently come up from
the country. She showed a tender interest in me and lovingly said I had
grown up beautifully. On my return she said: "What shall I give
you? You will not be interested in serious things: I will give you what
you like best." And she gave me more than fifty volumes of
Genji-monogatari put in a case, as well as Isé-monogatari, Yojimi,
Serikawa, Shirara, and Asa-udzu. 1 How happy I was when I came home
carrying these books in a bag! Until then I had only read a volume here
and there, and was dissatisfied because I could not understand the
story. 

Now I could be absorbed in these stories, taking them out one by one,
shutting myself in behind the kicho. 2 To be a Queen were nothing
compared to this! 

All day and all night, as late as I could keep my eyes open, I did
nothing but look at the books, setting a lamp 3 close beside me. 

Soon I learnt by heart all the names in the books, and I thought that a
great thing. 

Once I dreamt of a holy priest in yellow Buddhist scarf who came to me
and said, "Learn the fifth book of the Hokekkyo 4 at once." 

I did not tell any one about this, nor had I any [Page 20]  mind to
learn it, but continued to bathe in the romances. Although I was still
ugly and undeveloped [I thought to myself] the time would come when I
should be beautiful beyond compare, with long, long hair. I should be
like the Lady Yugao [in the romance] loved by the Shining Prince Genji,
or like the Lady Ukifuné, the wife of the General of Uji [a famous
beauty]. I indulged in such fancies­shallow-minded I was, indeed! 

Could such a man as the Shining Prince be living in this world? How
could General Kaoru [literal translation, "Fragrance"] find such a
beauty as Lady Ukifuné to conceal in his secret villa at Uji? Oh! I was
like a crazy girl. 

While I had lived in the country, I had gone to the temple from time to
time, but even then I could never pray like others, with a pure
heart. In those days people learned to recite sutras and practice
austerities of religious observance after the age of seventeen or
eighteen, but I could scarcely even think of such matters. The only
thing that I could think of was the Shining Prince who would some day
come to me, as noble and beautiful as in the romance. If he came only
once a year I, being hidden in a mountain villa like Lady Ukifuné,
would be content. I could live as heart-dwindlingly as that lady,
looking at flowers, or moonlit snowy landscape, occasionally receiving
long-expected lovely letters from my Lord! I cherished such fancies and
imagined that they might be realized. 

On the moon-birth of the Rice-Sprout month I 

[Facing Page]


KICHO: FRONT AND BACK VIEWS

[Page 21]  saw the white petals of the Tachibana tree [a kind of
orange] near the house covering the ground. 

Scarce had my mind received with wonder, 
  The thought of newly fallen snow­ 
  Seeing the ground lie white­
When the scent of Tachibana flowers 
  Arose from fallen blossoms. 
In our garden trees grew as thick as in the dark forest of Ashigara,
and in the Gods-absent month 1 its red leaves were more beautiful than
those of the surrounding mountains. A visitor said, "On my way thither
I passed a place where red leaves were beautiful"; and I improvised: 

No sight can be more autumnal
      than that of my garden
Tenanted by an autumnal person 
      weary of the world! 
I still dwelt in the romances from morning to night, and as long as I
was awake. 

I had another dream: a man said that he was to make a brook in the
garden of the Hexagon Tower to entertain the Empress of the First Rank
of Honour. I asked the reason, and the man said, "Pray to the
Heaven-illuminating honoured Goddess." I did not tell any one about
this dream or even think of it again. How shallow I was! 

In the Spring I enjoyed the Princess's garden. Cherry-blossoms waited
for!­cherry-blossoms la- [Page 22]  mented over! In Spring I love the
flowers whether in her garden or in mine. 

On the moon-hidden day of the Ever-growing month [March 30, 1023], I
started for a certain person's house to avoid the evil influence of the
earth god. 1 There I saw delightful cherry-blossoms still on the tree
and the day after my return I sent this poem: 

Alone, without tiring, I gazed at the cherry-blossoms of
      your garden.
The Spring was closing­they were about to fall­ 
Always when the flowers came and went, I could think of nothing but
those days when my nurse died, and sadness descended upon me, which
grew deeper when I studied the handwriting of the Honoured Daughter of
the First Adviser. 
Once in the Rice-Sprout month, when I was up late reading a romance, I
heard a cat mewing with a long-drawn-out cry. I turned, wondering, and
saw a very lovely cat. "Whence does it come?" I asked. "Sh," said my
sister, "do not tell anybody. It is a darling cat and we will keep it." 

The cat was very sociable and lay beside us. Some one might be looking
for her [we thought], so we kept her secretly. She kept herself aloof
from the vulgar servants, always sitting quietly before us. She turned
her face away from unclean food, never eating it. She was tenderly
cared for and caressed by us. [Page 23]  

Once sister was ill, and the family was rather upset. The cat was kept
in a room facing the north [i.e. a servant's room], and never was
called. She cried loudly and scoldingly, yet I thought it better to
keep her away and did so. Sister, suddenly awakening, said to me,
"Where is the cat kept? Bring her here." I asked why, and sister
said: " In my dream the cat came to my side and said, 'I am the altered
form of the late Honoured Daughter of the First Adviser to the
King. There was a slight cause [for this]. Your sister has been
thinking of me affectionately, so I am here for a while, but now I am
among the servants. O how dreary I am!' So saying she wept
bitterly. She appeared to be a noble and beautiful person and then I
awoke to hear the cat crying! How pitiful!" 

The story moved me deeply and after this I never sent the cat away to
the north-facing room, but waited on her lovingly. Once, when I was
sitting alone, she came and sat before me, and, stroking her head, I
addressed her: "You are the first daughter of the Noble Adviser? I wish
to let your father know of it." The cat watched my face and mewed,
lengthening her voice. 

It may be my fancy, but as I was watching her she seemed no common
cat. She seemed to understand my words, and I pity her. 

I had heard that a certain person possessed the Chogonka 1 [Song of the
Long Regret] retold from [Page 24]  the original of the Chinese poet Li
T'ai Po. I longed to borrow it, but was too shy to say so. 

On the seventh day of the Seventh month I found a happy means to send
my word [the suggestion of my wish]: 

This is the night when in the ancient Past,
The Herder Star embarked to meet the Weaving One;
In its sweet remembrance the wave rises high in the River of Heaven.1
Even so swells my heart to see the famous book. 
The answer was: 

The star gods meet on the shore of the Heavenly River, 
Like theirs full of ecstasy is my heart
And grave things of daily life are forgotten
On the night your message comes to me. 
On the thirteenth day of that month the moon shone very
brightly. Darkness was chased away even [Page 25]  from every corner of
the heavens. It was about midnight and all were asleep. 

We were sitting on the veranda. My sister, who was gazing at the sky
thoughtfully, said, " If I flew away now, leaving no trace behind; what
would you think of it?" She saw that her words shocked me, and she
turned the conversation [lightly] to other things, and we laughed. 

Then I heard a carriage with a runner before it stop near the
house. The man in the carriage called out,
"Ogi-no-ha! Ogi-no-ha!" [Reed-leaf, a woman's name or pet name] twice,
but no woman made reply. The man cried in vain until he was tired of
it, and played his flute [a reed-pipe] more and more searchingly in a
very beautiful rippling melody, and [at last] drove away. 

Flute music in the night,
"Autumn Wind" 1 sighing,
Why does the reed-leaf make no reply? 
Thus I challenged my sister, and she took it up: 

Alas! light of heart
Who could so soon give over playing! 
The wind did not wait
For the response of the reed-leaf. 
We sat together looking up into the firmament, and went to bed after
daybreak. 
At midnight of the Deutzia month [April, 1024] a fire broke out, and
the cat which had been waited on as a daughter of the First Adviser was
burned to death. She had been used to come mewing whenever I called
[Page 26]  her by the name of that lady, as if she had understood
me. My father said that he would tell the matter to the First Adviser,
for it is a strange and heartfelt story. I was very, very sorry for
her. 

Our new temporary shelter was far narrower than the other. I was sad,
for we had a very small garden and no trees. I thought with regret of
the old spacious garden which was wild as a deep wood, and in time of
flowers and red leaves the sight of it was never inferior to the
surrounding mountains. 

In the garden of the opposite house white and red plum-blossoms grew in
confusion and their perfume came on the wind and filled me with
thoughts of our old home. 

When from the neighbouring garden the perfume-laden air
Saturates my soul with memories,
Rises the thought of the beloved plum-tree
Blooming under the eaves of the house which is gone. 
On the moon-birth of the Rice-Sprout month my sister died after giving
birth to a child. From childhood, even a stranger's death had touched
my heart deeply. This time I lamented, filled with speechless pity and
sorrow. 

While mother and the others were with the dead, I lay with the
memory-awakening children one on either side of me. The moonlight found
its way through the cracks of the roof [perhaps of their temporary
dwelling] and illumined the face of the baby. The sight gave my heart
so deep a pang that I covered its face with my sleeve, and drew the
other child closer to my side, mothering the unfortunate.

A NOBLEMAN'S HOUSE AND GROUNDS IN THE AZUMAYA STYLE

[Page 27]  

After some days one of my relatives sent me a romance entitled "The
Prince Yearning after the Buried," with the following note: "The late
lady had asked me to find her this romance. At that time I thought it
impossible, but now to add to my sorrow, some one has just sent it to
me." 

I answered: 

What reason can there be that she 
Strangely should seek a romance of the buried?
Buried now is the seeker 
Deep under the mosses. 
My sister's nurse said that since she had lost her, she had no reason
to stay and went back to her own home weeping. 

Thus death or parting separates us each from the other, 
Why must we part? Oh, world too sad for me! 
"For remembrance of her I wanted to write about her," began a letter
from her nurse­but it stopped short with the words, "Ink seems to have
frozen up, I cannot write any more." 1 

How shall I gather memories of my sister?
The stream of letters is congealed. 
No comfort may be found in icicles. 
So I wrote, and the answer was: 

Like the comfortless plover of the beach 
In the sand printing characters soon to be washed away, 
Unable to leave a more enduring trace in this fleeting world. 
[Page 28]  
That nurse went to see the grave and returned sobbing, saying: 

I seek her in the field, but she is not there,
Nor is she in the smoke of the cremation.
Where is her last dwelling-place?
How can I find it? 
The lady who had been my stepmother heard of this [and wrote]: 

When we wander in search of her, 
Ignorant of her last dwelling-place,
Standing before the thought 
Tears must be our guide. 
The person who had sent "The Prince Yearning after the Buried" wrote: 

How she must have wandered seeking the unfindable 
In the unfamiliar fields of bamboo grasses, 
        Vainly weeping! 
Reading these poems my brother, who had followed the funeral that
night, composed a poem: 

Before my vision 
  The fire and smoke of burning 
Arose and died again.
  To bamboo fields there is no more returning, 
Why seek there in vain? 
It snowed for many days, and I thought of the nun who lived on Mount
Yoshino, to whom I wrote: 

  Snow has fallen
And you cannot have
  Even the unusual sight of men
Along the precipitous path of the Peak of Yoshino. 
On the Sociable month of the next year father was looking forward with
happy expectation to the night [Page 29]  when he might expect an
appointment as Governor of a Province. He was disappointed, and a
person who might have shared our joy wrote to me, saying: 

"I anxiously waited for the dawn with uncertain hope." 

The temple bell roused me from dreams 
And waiting for the starlit dawn 
The night, alas! was long as are 
One hundred autumn nights. 
I wrote back: 

Long was the night. 
The bell called from dreams in vain, 
For it did not toll our realized hopes. 
Towards the moon-hidden days [last days] of the Rice-Sprout month I
went for a certain reason to a temple at Higashiyama. 1 On the way the
nursery beds for rice-plants were filled with water, and the fields
were green all over with the young growing rice. It was a
smile-presenting sight. It gave a feeling of loneliness to see the dark
shadow of the mountain close before me. In the lovely evenings
water-rails chattered in the fields. 

The water-rails cackle as if they were knocking at the gate, 
But who would be deceived into opening the door, saying,
Our friend has come along the mountain path in the dark night? 
As the place was near the Reizan Temple I went there to
worship. Arriving so far I was fatigued, and drank from a stone-lined
well beside the mountain temple, scooping the water into the hollow of
my hand. 

My friend said, "I could never have enough of this [Page 30]
water." "Is it the first time," I asked, "that you have tasted the
satisfying sweetness of a mountain well drunk from the hollow of your
hand?" She said, "It is sweeter than to drink from a shallow spring,
which becomes muddy even from the drops which fall from the hand which
has scooped it up." 1 We came home from the temple in the full
brightness of evening sunshine, and had a clear view of Kioto below us. 

My friend, who had said that a spring becomes muddy even with drops
falling into it, had to go back to the Capital. 

I was sorry to part with her and sent word the next morning: 

When the evening sun descends behind the mountain peak, 
Will you forget that it is I who gaze with longing 
Towards the place where you are? 
The holy voices of the priests reciting sutras in their morning service
could be heard from my house and I opened the door. It was dim early
dawn; mist veiled the green forest, which was thicker and darker than
in the time of flowers or red leaves. The sky seemed clouded this
lovely morning. Cuckoos were singing on the near-by trees. 

O for a friend­that we might see and listen together! 
O the beautiful dawn in the mountain village!­ 
The repeated sound of cuckoos near and far away. 
On that moon-hidden day cuckoos sung clamorously on trees towards the
glen. "In the Royal City poets [Page 31]  may be awaiting you, cuckoos,
yet you sing here carelessly from morning till night!" 

One who sat near me said: "Do you think that there is one person, at
least, in the Capital who is listening to cuckoos, and thinking of us
at this moment?"­and then: 

Many in the Royal City like to gaze on the calm moon. 
But is there one who thinks of the deep mountain 
Or is reminded of us hidden here? 
I replied: 

In the dead of night, moon-gazing,
The thought of the deep mountain affrighted,
Yet longings for the mountain village
At all other moments filled my heart. 
Once, towards dawn, I heard footsteps which seemed to be those of many
persons coming down the mountain. I wondered and looked out. It was a
herd of deer which came close to our dwelling. They cried out. It was
not pleasant to hear them near by. 

It is sweet to hear the love-call of a deer to its mate,
In Autumn nights, upon the distant hills. 
I heard that an acquaintance had come near my residence and gone back
without calling on me. So I wrote: 

Even this wandering wind among the pines of the mountain­
I've heard that it departs with murmuring sound. 
[That is, you are not like it. You do not speak when going away.] 

In the Leaf-Falling month [September] I saw the moon more than twenty
days old. It was towards [Page 31]  dawn; the mountain-side was gloomy
and the sound of the waterfall was all [I heard]. I wish that lovers
[of nature] may see the after-dawn-waning moon in a mountain village at
the close of an autumn night. 

I went back to Kioto when the rice-fields, which had been filled with
water when I came, were dried up, the rice being harvested. The young
plants in their bed of water­the plants harvested­the fields dried
up­so long I remained away from home. 

'Twas the moon-hidden of the Gods-absent month when I went there again
for temporary residence. The thick grown leaves which had cast a dark
shade were all fallen. The sight was heartfelt over all. The sweet,
murmuring ringlet was buried under fallen leaves and I could see only
the course of it. 

Even water could not live on­ 
So lonesome is the mountain 
Of the leaf-scattering stormy wind. 
[At about this time the author of this diary seems to have had some
family troubles. Her father received no appointment from the King­they
were probably poor, and her gentle, poetic nature did not incline her
to seek useful friends at court; therefore many of the best years of
her youth were spent in obscurity­a great contrast to the "Shining
Prince" dreams of her childhood.] 

I went back to Kioto saying that I should come again the next Spring,
could I live so long, and begged the nun to send word when the
flowering-time had come. [Page 33]  

It was past the nineteenth of the Ever-growing month of the next year
[1026], but there were no tidings from her, so I wrote: 

No word about the blooming cherry-blossoms, 
Has not the Spring come for you yet? 
Or does the perfume of flowers not reach you? 
I made a journey, and passed many a moonlit night in a house beside a
bamboo wood. Wind rustled its leaves and my sleep was disturbed. 

Night after night the bamboo leaves sigh,
My dreams are broken and a vague, indefinite sadness fills my heart. 
In Autumn [1026] I went to live elsewhere and sent a poem: 

I am like dew on the grass­ 
And pitiable wherever I may be­ 
But especially am I oppressed with sadness 
In a field with a thin growth of reeds. 
After that time I was somehow restless and forgot about the
romances. My mind became more sober and I passed many years without
doing any remarkable thing. I neglected religious services and temple
observances. Those fantastic ideas [of the romances] can they be
realized in this world ? If father could win some good position I also
might enter into a much nobler life. Such unreliable hopes then
occupied my daily thoughts. 

At last 1 father was appointed Governor of Province very far in the
East. [Page 34]  

[Here the diary skips six years. The following is reminiscent.] 

He [father] said: "I was always thinking that if I could win a position
as Governor in the neighbourhood of the Capital I could take care of
you to my heart's desire. I would wish to bring you down to see
beautiful scenery of sea and mountain. Moreover, I wished that you
could live attended beyond [the possibilities] of our [present]
position. Our Karma relation from our former world must have been
bad. Now I have to go to so distant a country after waiting so
long! When I brought you, who were a little child, to the Eastern
Province [at his former appointment], even a slight illness caused me
much trouble of mind in thinking that should I die, you would wander
helpless in that far country. There were many fears in a stranger's
country, and I should have lived with an easier mind had I been
alone. As I was then accompanied by all my family, I could not say or
do what I wanted to say or do, and I was ashamed of it. Now you are
grown up [she was twenty-five years old] and I am not sure that I can
live long. 

It is not so unusual a fate to be helpless in the Capital, but the
saddest thing of all would be to wander in the Eastern Province like
any country woman. 1 There are no relatives in the Capital upon whom we
could rely to foster you, yet I cannot refuse the appointment which has
been made after such long [Page 35]  waiting. So you must remain here,
and I must depart for Eternity.­Oh, in what way may I provide a way for
you to live in the Capital decently! 

Night and day he lamented, saying these things, and I forgot all about
flowers or maple leaves, grieving sadly, but there was no help for it. 

He went down 1 on the thirteenth of the Seventh month, 1032. 

For several days before that I could not remain still in my own room,
for I thought it difficult to see him again. 

On that day [the 13th] after restless hours, when the [time for]
parting came, I had lifted the blind and my eye met his, from which
tears dropped down. Soon he had passed by. 2 My eyes were dim with
tears and soon I concealed myself in bed [tears were bad manners]. A
man who had gone to see him off returned with a poem written on a bit
of pocket paper. 

A message from her father: 

If I could do as I wish 
I could acknowledge more profoundly 
The sorrow of departing in Autumn. 
[The last line has, of course, reference to his age and the probability
of never returning.] [Page 36]  

I could not read the poem to the end. 

In the happier time I had often tried to compose halting poems
[literally, of broken loins], but at present I had no word to say. 

­never began to think in this world even for
       a moment from you to part. Alas! 
No person came to my side and I was very lonely and forlorn musing and
guessing where he would be at every moment. As I knew the road he was
taking [the same which is described in this journal], I thought of him
the more longingly and with greater heart-shrinking. Morning and
evening I looked towards the sky-line of the eastern mountains. 

In the Leaf-Falling month I went to the temple at Udzumaza [Korinji] to
pass many days. 

We came upon two men's palanquins in the road from Ichijo, which had
stopped there. They must have been waiting for some one to catch up
with them. When I passed by they sent an attendant with the
message: "Flower-seeing go?­we suppose." 

I thought it would be awkward not to reply to such a slight matter, and
answered: 

                  Thousand kinds 1­
To be like them in the fields of Autumn. 
I stayed in the temple for seven days, but could think of nothing but
the road to the East. 

I prayed to the Buddha, saying: "There is no way to change the present,
but grant that we may meet [Page 37]  again peacefully after this
parting"­and I thought the Buddha would pity and grant my prayer. 

It was midwinter. It rained all day. In the night a cloud-turning wind
blew terribly and the sky cleared. The moon became exquisitely bright,
and it was sad to see the tall reeds near the house broken and blown
down by the wind. 

Dead stalks of reeds must be reminded of good Autumn days 
In midwinter depths the tempest lays them low,
Confused and broken. 
["Their fate is like my own," is intangibly expressed in this poem.]; 

A messenger arrived from the East. 

Father's letter: 

"I wandered through the Province [Hitachi, now Ibarakiken] going into
every Shinto shrine and saw a wide field with a beautiful river running
through it. 1 There was a beautiful wood. My first thought was of you,
and to make you see it, and I asked the name of that grove. 'The grove
of Longing After One's Child' was the answer. I thought of the one who
had first named it and was extremely sad. Alighting from my horse I
stood there for two hours. 

After leaving­
Like me he must have yearned 
Sorrowful to see­ 
The forest of Longing After One's Child." 
To see that letter is a sadder thing than to have seen the forest. 

[The poem sent in return presents difficulties in the [Page 38]  way of
translation as there is a play upon words, literally it is something
like this:] 

The grove of "Longing After One's Child"; left; Father-caressed 1
Mountain; [Chichibusan] hard Eastern way­ 

The grove of Longing After One's Child­ 
Hearing of it I think of the Father-caressed Mountain:
Towards it hard is the Eastern way 
  For a child left [here alone]. 
Thus I passed days in doing nothing, and I began to think of going to
temples [making pilgrimages]. Mother was a person of extremely
antiquated mind. She said: "Oh, dreadful is the Hatsusé Temple! What
should you do if you were caught by some one at the Nara
ascent? Ishiyama too! Sekiyama Pass [near Lake Biwa] is very
dreadful! Kurama-san [the famous mountain], oh, dreadful to bring you
there! You may go there when father comes back." 

As mother says so, I can go only to Kiyomidzu Temple. 2 My old habits
of romantic indulgence were not dead yet, and I could not fix my mind
on religious thoughts as I ought. 

In the equinoctial week there was a great tumult [of festival], so
great a noise that I was even afraid of it, and when I lay asleep I
dreamt there was a priest within the enclosure before the altar, in
blue garments with loose brocade hood and brocade shoes. He seemed to
be the intendant of the temple: "You, being occupied with vain
thoughts, are not praying for happi- [Page 39]  ness in the world to
come," he said indignantly, and went behind the curtain. I awoke
startled, yet neither told any one what I had dreamt, nor thought about
it much. 

My mother had two one-foot-in-diameter bronze mirrors cast and made a
priest take them for us to the Hatsusé Temple. Mother told the priest
to pass two or three days in the temple especially praying that a dream
might be vouchsafed about the future state of this woman [the
daughter]. For that period I was made to observe religious purity
[i.e. abstain from animal food.] 

The priest came back to tell the following: 

"I was reluctant to return without having even a dream, and after
bowing many times and performing other ceremonies I went to
sleep. There came out from behind the curtain a graceful holy lady in
beautiful garments. She, taking up the offered mirrors, asked me if no
letters were affixed to these mirrors. I answered in the most
respectful manner, 'There were no letters. I was told only to offer
these.' 'Strange!' she said. 'Letters are to be added. See what is
mirrored in one, it creates pity to look at it.' I saw her weep
bitterly and saw appear in the mirror shadows of people rolling over in
lamentation. 'To see these shadows makes one sad, but to see this makes
one happy,' and she held up the other mirror. There, the misu was fresh
green and many-coloured garments were revealed below the lower edge of
it. Plum and cherry-blossoms were in flower. Nightingales were singing
from tree to tree." [Page 40]  

I did not even listen to his story nor question him as to how things
seemed in his dream. Some one said, "Pray to the Heavenly Illuminating
Honoured Goddess," and my irreverent mind thought, "Where is she? Is
she a Goddess or a Buddha?" 

At first I said so, but afterwards grew more discreet and asked some
one about her, who replied: "She is a goddess, and takes up her abode
at Isé. 1 The goddess is also worshipped by the Provincial Governor of
Kii. She is worshipped at the ancestor shrine in the Imperial Court." 

I could not by any means get to Isé. How could I bow before the
Imperial shrine? I could never be allowed to go there. The idea flowed
through my mind to pray for the heavenly light. 

A relative of mine became a nun, and entered the Sugaku Temple. In
winter I sent her a poem: 

Even tears arise for your sake 
When I think of the mountain hamlet 
Where snow-storms will be raging. 
Reply: 

I seem to have a glimpse of you
Coming to me through the dark wood,
When close over head is Summer's growth of leaves. 
1036. Father, who had gone down towards the East, came back at last. He
settled down at Nishiyama, and we all went there. We were very
happy. One moon-bright night we talked all the night through: [Page 41]  

Such nights as this exist! 
As if it were for Eternity, I parted from you­ 
How sad was that Autumn! 
At this father shed tears [of happiness] abundantly, and answered me
with a poem: 

That life grows dear and is lived with rejoicing
Which once was borne with hate and lamentation 
My joy knew no bounds when my waiting was at an end after the supposed
parting "for Eternity," yet my father said: "It is ridiculous to lead a
worldly life when one is very old. I used to feel so when I saw old
men, but now it is my turn to be old, so I will retire from social
life." As he said it with no lingering affection for this world, I felt
quite alone. 

Towards the East the field stretched far and wide and I could see
clearly from Mount Hiyé 1 to Mount Inari. Towards the West, the pines
of the forest of Narabigaoka were sounding in my ear, and up to the
tableland on which our house stood the rice-fields were cultivated in
terraces, while from them came the sound of the bird-scaring clappers,
giving me a homely country sentiment. 

One moonlight evening I had a message from an old acquaintance who had
had an opportunity to send to me, and this I sent back: 

None calls upon me, or remembers me in my mountain village. 
On the reeds by the thin hedge, the Autumn winds are sighing. 
1037. In the Tenth month we changed our abode to the Capital. Mother
had become a nun, and although [Page 42]  she lived in the same house,
shut herself up in a separate chamber. Father rather treated me as an
independent woman than as his child. I felt helpless to see him
shunning all society and living hidden in the shade. 

A person [the Princess Yuko, daughter of the Emperor Toshiyaku] who had
heard about me through a distant relative called me [to her] saying it
would be better [to be with her] than passing idle lonely days. 

My old-fashioned parents thought the court life would be very
unpleasant, and wanted me to pass my time at home, but others
said: "People nowadays go out as ladies-in-waiting at the Court, and
then fortunate opportunities [for marriage] are naturally numerous; why
not try it?" So [at the age of twenty-six] I was sent to the Court
against my will. 

I went for one night the first time. I was dressed in an eight-fold
uchigi of deep and pale chrysanthemum colours, and over it I wore the
outer flowing robe of deep-red silk. 

As I have said before, my mind was absorbed in romances, and I had no
important relatives from whom I could learn distinguished manners or
court customs, so except from the romances I could not know them. I had
always been in the shadow of the antiquated parents, and had been
accustomed not to go out but to see moon and flowers. So when I left
home I felt as if I were not I nor was it the real world [to which I
was going]. I started in the early morning. I had often fancied in my
countrified mind that I should hear more interesting things for my
heart's [Page 43]  consolation than were to be found living fixed in my
parents' house. 

I felt awkward in Court in everything I did, and I thought it sad, but
there was no use in complaining. I remembered with grief my nieces who
had lost their mother and had been cared for by me alone, even sleeping
at night one on either side of me. 

Days were spent in musing with a vacant mind. I felt as if some one
were [always] spying upon me, and I was embarrassed. 1 After ten days
or so I got leave to go out. Father and mother were waiting for me with
a comfortable fire in a brazier. 

Seeing me getting out of my palanquin, my nieces said: "When you were
with us people came to see us, but now no one's voice is heard, no
one's shadow falls before the house. We are very low-spirited; what can
you do for us who must pass days like this?" It was pitiful to see them
cry when they said it. The next morning they sat before me, saying: "As
you are here many persons are coming and going. It seems livelier." 

Tears came to my eyes to think what virtue [literally, fragrance] I
could have that my little nieces made so much of me. 


It would be very difficult even for a saint to dream of his prenatal
life. Yet, when I was before the altar of the Kiyomidzu Temple, in a
faintly dreamy state [Page 44]  of mind which was neither sleeping nor
waking, I saw a man who seemed to be the head of the temple. He came
out and said to me: 

"You were once a priest of this temple and you were born into a better
state by virtue of the many Buddhist images which you carved as a
Buddhist artist. The Buddha seventeen feet high which is enthroned in
the eastern side of the temple was your work. When you were in the act
of covering it with gold foil you died." 

"Oh, undeservedly blessed!" I said. "I will finish it, then." 

The priest replied: "As you died, another man covered it and performed
the ceremony of offerings." 

I came to myself and thought: "If I serve with all my heart the Buddha
of the Kiyomidzu Temple... by virtue of my prayers in this temple in
the previous life..." 1 

In the Finishing month I went again to the Court. A room was assigned
for my use. 

I went to the Princess's apartment every night and lay down among
unknown persons, so I could not sleep at all. I was bashful and timid
and wept in secret. In the morning I retired while it was still dark
and passed the days in longing for home where my old and weak parents,
making much of me, relied upon me as if I were worthy of it. I yearned
for them and felt very lonely. Unfortunate, deplorable, and helpless
mind!­That was graven into my thought and although I had to perform my
duty faithfully I could 

[Facing Page] 


THREE KICHO PUT TOGETHER
The curtains of the screen, or kicho, varied with the seasons. This is
a summer one with decorations of summer grasses and flowers. 

[Page 45]  not always wait upon the Princess. She seemed not to guess
what was in my heart, and attributing it only to shyness favored me by
summoning me often from among the other ladies. She used to say, "Call
the younger ladies!" and I was dragged out in spite of myself. 

Those who were familiar with the court life seemed to be at home there,
but I, who was not very young, yet did not wish to be counted among the
elderly, was rather neglected, and made to usher guests. However, I did
not expect too much of court life, and had no envy for those who were
more graceful than I. This, on the contrary, set me at ease, and I from
time to time presented myself before the Princess; and talked only with
congenial friends about lovely things. Even on smile-presenting,
interesting occasions I shrank from intruding and becoming too popular,
and did not go far into most things. 

Sleeping one night before the Princess, I was awakened by cries and
fluttering noises from the waterfowl in the pond. 

Like us the waterfowl pass all the night in floating sleep,
They seem to be weary 
With shaking away the frost from their feathers. 
My companions passed their leisure time in talking over romances with
the door open which separated our rooms, and they often called back one
who had gone to the Princess's apartment. She sent word once, "I will
go if I must" [intending to give herself the pleasure of coming]. [Page
46]  

The long leaves of the reed are easily bent, 
So I will not forcibly persuade it, 
But leave it to the wind. 
In this way [composing poems] we passed [the hours] talking
idly. Afterwards this lady separated from the Court and left us. She
remembered that night and sent me word­ 

That moonless, flowerless winter night
It penetrates my thought and makes me dwell on it­
        I wonder why? 
It touched my heart, for I also was thinking of that night: 

In my dreams the tears of that cold night are still frozen. 
But these I weep away secretly. 
The Princess still called my stepmother by the name of Kazusa 1
­Governor's lady. Father was displeased that that name was still used
after she had become another man's wife, and he made me write to her
about it: 

The name of Asakura in a far-off country,
The Court now hears it in a divine dance-song.­
My name also is still somewhere heard [but not honourably]. 2 
One very bright night, after the full moon, I attended the Princess to
the Imperial Palace. I remembered that the Heaven Illuminating Goddess
was enthroned within, and wanted to take an opportunity to kneel before
the altar. One moon-bright night [Page 47]  [1042 A.D.] I went in [to
the shrine] privately, for I know Lady Hakasé 1 who was taking care of
this shrine. The perpetual lights before the altar burned dimly. She
[the Lady Hakasé] grew wondrously old and holy; she seems not like a
mortal, but like a divine incarnation, yet she spoke very gracefully. 

The moon was very bright on the following night and the Princess's
ladies passed the time in talking and moon-gazing, opening the doors
[outer shutters] of the Fujitsubo. 2 The footsteps of the Royal consort
of Umetsubo going up to the King's apartment were so exquisitely
graceful as to excite envy. "Had the late Queen 3 been living, she
could not walk so grandly," some one said. I composed a poem: 

She is like the Moon, who, opening the gate of Heaven, 
    goes up over the clouds.
We, being in the same heavenly Palace, pass the night 
    in remembering the footfalls of the past. 
The ladies who are charged with the duty of introducing the court
nobles seem to have been fixed upon, and nobody notices whether
simple-hearted country-women like me exist or not. On a very dark night
in the beginning of the Gods-absent month, when sweet-voiced reciters
were to read sutras throughout the night, another lady and I went out
towards the entrance door of the Audience Room to listen to [Page 48]
it, and after talking fell asleep, listening, leaning,... 1 when I
noticed a gentleman had come to be received in audience by the
Princess. 

"It is awkward to run away to our apartment [to escape him]..We will
remain here. Let it be as it will." So said my companion and I sat
beside her listening. 

He spoke gently and quietly. There was nothing about him to be
regretted. "Who is the other lady?" he asked of my friend. He said
nothing rude or amorous like other men, but talked delicately of the
sad, sweet things of the world, and many a phrase of his with a strange
power enticed me into conversation. He wondered that there should have
been in the Court one who was a stranger to him, and did not seem
inclined to go away soon. 

There was no starlight, and a gentle shower fell in the darkness; how
lovely was its sound on the leaves! "The more deeply beautiful is the
night," he said; "the full moonlight would be too
dazzling." Discoursing about the beauties of Spring and Autumn he
continued: "Although every hour has its charm, pretty is the spring
haze; then the sky being tranquil and overcast, the face of the moon is
not too bright; it seems to be floating on a distant river. At such a
time the calm spring melody of the lute is exquisite. 

"In Autumn, on the other hand, the moon is very bright; though there
are mists trailing over the horizon we can see things as clearly as if
they were at hand. The sound of wind, the voices of insects, all sweet
things seem to melt together. When at such a [Page 49]  time we listen
to the autumnal music of the koto 1 we forget the Spring­we think that
is best­ 

"But the winter sky frozen all over magnificently cold! The snow
covering the earth and its light mingling with the moonshine! Then the
notes of the hitchiriki 2 vibrate on the air and we forget Spring and
Autumn." And he asked us, "Which captivates your fancy? On which stays
your mind?" 

My companion answered in favour of Autumn and I, not being willing to
imitate her, said: 

Pale green night and flowers all melting into one 
    in the soft haze­
Everywhere the moon, glimmering in the Spring night. 
So I replied. And he, after repeating my poem to himself over and over,
said: "Then you give up Autumn? After this, as long as I live, such a
spring night shall be for me a memento of your personality." The person
who favoured Autumn said, "Others seem to give their hearts to Spring,
and I shall be alone gazing at the autumn moon." 

He was deeply interested, and being uncertain in thought said: "Even
the poets of the Tang Empire 3 could not decide which to praise most,
Spring or Autumn. Your decisions make me think that there must be some
personal reasons when our inclination is touched or charmed. Our souls
are imbued with the colours of the sky, moon, or flowers of that
moment. I desire much to know how you came to know the [Page 50]
charms of Spring and Autumn. The moon of a winter night is given as an
instance of dreariness, and as it is very cold I had never seen it
intentionally. When I went down to Isé to be present as the messenger
of the King at the ceremony 1 of installing the virgin in charge of the
shrine, I wanted to come back in the early dawn, so went to take leave
of the Princess [whose installation had just taken place] in a
moon-bright night after many days' snow, half shrinking to think of my
journey. 

"Her residence was an other-worldly place awful even to the
imagination, but she called me into an adequate apartment. There were
persons [in that room] who had come down in the reign of the Emperor
Enyu. 2 Their aspect was very holy, ancient, and mystical. They told of
the things of long ago with tears. They brought out a well-tuned
four-stringed lute. The music did not seem to be anything happening in
this world; I regretted that day should even dawn, and was touched so
deeply that I had almost forgotten about returning to the Capital. Ever
since then the snowy nights of winter recall that scene, and I without
fail gaze at the moon even though hugging the fire. You will surely
understand me, and hereafter every dark night with gentle rain will
touch my heart; I feel this has not been inferior to the snowy night at
the palace of the Isé virgin." 

With these words he departed and I thought he could not have known who
I was. [Page 51]  

In the Eighth month of the next year [1043] we went again to the
Imperial Palace, and there was in the Court an entertainment throughout
the night. I did not know that he was present at it, and I passed that
night in my own room. When I looked out [in early morning] opening the
sliding doors on the corridor I saw the morning moon very faint and
beautiful. I heard footsteps and people approached­some reciting citing
sutras. One of them came to the entrance, and addressed me. I replied,
and he, suddenly remembering, exclaimed, "That night of softly falling
rain I do not forget, even for a moment! I yearn for it." As chance did
not permit me many words I said: 

What intensity of memory clings to your heart? 
That gentle shower fell on the leaves­
Only for a moment [our hearts touched]. 
I had scarcely said so when people came up and I stole back without his
answer. 

That evening, after I had gone to my room, my companion came in to tell
me that he had replied to my poem: "If there be such a tranquil night
as that of the rain, I should like in some way to make you listen to my
lute, playing all the songs I can remember." 

I wanted to hear it, and waited for the fit occasion, but there was
none, ever. 

In the next year one tranquil evening I heard that he had come into the
Princess's Palace, so I crept out of my chamber with my companion, but
there were many people waiting within and without the Palace, and I
turned back. He must have been of the same [Page 52]  mind with me. He
had come because it was so still a night, and he returned because it
was noisy. 

I yearn for a tranquil moment
To be out upon the sea of harmony,
In that enchanted boat.
Oh, boatman, do you know my heart? 
So I composed that poem­and there is nothing more to tell. His
personality was very excellent and he was not an ordinary man, but time
passed, and neither called to the other. 

In Winter, though the snow had not come yet, the starlit sky was clear
and cold. One whole night I talked with those who were in the Palace
. 1 

Like a good-for-nothing woman I retired from the Court life. 


On the twenty-fifth of the End month [Christmas Day, 1043] I was
summoned by the Princess to the religious service of reciting Buddha's
names. I went for that night only. About forty ladies were there all
dressed in deep-red dresses and also in deep-red outer robe. I sat
behind the person who led me in­the most shadow-like person among
them­and I retired before dawn. On my way home it snowed in fluttering
flakes, and the frozen, ghostly moon was reflected in my dull-red
sleeves of glossy silk. Even that reflection seemed to be wet and
sad. I thought all the way: "The year comes to a close and the night
also­and the moon reflected in my sleeve­all [Page 53]  passes. When
one is in Court, one may become familiar with those who serve there,
and know worldly things better, and if one is thought amiable one is
received as a lady and favours may be bestowed"­such had been my
thought, but father was now disappointed in me and kept me at home; but
how could I expect that my fortunes should become dazzling in a
moment? It was father's idle fancy, yet he felt that it had betrayed
him. 

Though a thousand times, how many! I gathered parsley 1 in the fields 
        Yet my wishes were by no means fulfilled. 
I grumbled so far, and no farther. 

I regretted deeply the idle fancies of old days, and as my parents
would not accompany me to temples [on pilgrimages] I could hardly
suppress my impatience. I wish to strengthen my spirit to bring up my
child who is still in the germ. Moreover, I wish to do my best to pile
up virtuous deeds for the life to come, so encouraging my heart I went
to the Ishiyama Temple after the twentieth day of the Frost month
[1045]. It snowed and the route was lovely. On coming in sight of the
barrier at Osaka Pass, I was reminded that it was also in Winter when I
passed it on my way up to Kioto. Then also it was a windy tempestuous
day. [Page 54]  

The sound of the Autumn wind at the barrier of Osaka! 
It differs not from that heard long ago. 
The temple at Seki, magnificent though it was, made me think of the old
roughly hewn Buddha. The beach at Uchidé has not changed in the passing
of months and years, but my own heart feels change. 

Towards evening I arrived at the temple and after a bath went up to the
main shrine. The mountain wind was dreadful. I took it for a good omen
that, falling asleep in the temple [I heard a voice], saying: "From the
inner shrine perfume has been bestowed. Tell it at once." At the words
I awoke, and passed the night in prayer. 

The next day the wind raged and it snowed heavily. I comforted my
lonely heart with the friend of the Princess who came with me. We left
after three days. 

On the twenty-fifth of the Tenth month of the next year [1046] the
Capital was in great excitement over the purification ceremonies before
the Great Ceremony.1 

For my part I wanted to set out that same day for Hasé [Temple] for my
own religious purification. They stopped me, saying it was a sight to
be seen only once in one reign; that even the country-people come to
see the procession, and it was madness to leave the city that very
day. "Your deeds will be spread abroad and people will gossip about
you," said my brother angrily. "No, no, let the person have her own
will"; and according to my wish he [her husband] let me start. His
kindness touched me, but on [Page 55]  the other hand I pitied those
who accompanied me [her retinue], who with longing hearts wanted to see
the ceremony. 

But what have we to do with such shows ? Buddha will be pleased with
those who come at a time like this. I wanted without fail to receive
the divine favour, and started before dawn. When I was crossing the
great bridge of Nijo, with pine torches flaming before me, and with my
attendants in pure white robes, all the men on horseback, in carriage,
or on foot who encountered me on their way to the stands prepared for
sight-seers said, in surprise, "What is that?" and some even laughed or
scolded me. As I was passing before the gate of Yoshinori the Commander
of the Bodyguard and his men were standing there before the wide-open
portals. They said, laughing, "Here goes a company to the temple­there
are many days and months in the world [to do that in]!" But there was
one [standing by] who said: "What is it to fatten the eyes for a
moment? They are firmly determined. They will surely receive Buddha's
favour; we ought also to make up our minds [for the good] without
sight-seeing." Thus one man spoke seriously. 

I had wanted to leave the city before broad daylight, and had started
in the middle of the night, but had to wait for belated persons till
the very thick fog became thinner. People flowed in from the country
like a river. Nobody could turn aside to make room for anybody else,
and even the ill-behaved and vulgar children, who passed beside my
carriage with some [Page 56]  difficulty, had words of wonder and
contempt for us. I felt sorry that I had started that day, yet praying
to Buddha with all my heart, I arrived at the ferry of Uji. Even there
the people were coming up to the city in throngs, and the ferry-man,
seeing these numberless people, was filled with his own importance, and
grew proud. He, tucking up his sleeves against his face and leaning on
his pole, would not bring the boat at once. He looked around whistling
and assumed an indifferent air. We could not cross the river for a long
time, so I looked around the place, which I had felt a curiosity to
see, ever since reading Genji-monogatari which tells that the daughter
of the Princess of Uji lived here. I thought it a charming spot. At
last we managed to get across the river and went to see the Uji
mansion. 1 I was at once reminded that the Lady Ukifuné [of the
romance] had been living here. 

As we had started before daybreak, my people were tired out, and rested
at Hiroichi to take food. The Guard said: "Is that the famous mountain
Kurikoma? It is towards evening, be ready with your armour" [to protect
from robbers or evil spirits]. I listened to these words with a
shudder, but we passed that mountain [without adventure] and the sun
was on its summit when we arrived at the lake [Page 57]  of Nieno. They
went in several directions to seek a lodging and returned saying there
was no proper place, only an obscure hut; but as there was no other
place we took that. 

In the house there were only two men, for the rest had all gone to the
Capital. Those two men did not sleep that night at all, but kept watch
around the house. My maids who were in the recess [perhaps the outer
part of the hut used as kitchen] asked, "Why do you walk about so?" and
the men answered, "Why? we have rented our house to perfect
strangers. What should we do if our kettles were stolen? Of course we
cannot sleep!" I felt both dread and laughter to hear them. 

In the early morning we left there and knelt before the great East
Temple. 1 The temple at Iso-no-Kami was antique and on the verge of
ruin. That night we lodged at Yamabé Temple. Although I was tired out,
I recited sutras and went to sleep. In my dream I saw a very noble and
pure woman. At her coming the wind blew deliciously. She found me out,
and said, smiling, "For what purpose have you come?" I answered, "How
could I help coming?" [since you are here], and she said, "You would
better be in the Imperial Court, and become intimate with the Lady
Hakasé." I was very much delighted and encouraged. 

We crossed the river and arrived at the Hatsusé Temple at night. After
purifying, I went up to the Temple. I remained three days, and slept
expecting [Page 58]  to start in the morning. At midnight I dreamt that
a cedar twig 1 was thrown into the room as a token bestowed by the
Inari god. I was startled, but waking found it only a dream. 

We began our return journey after midnight, and as we could not find a
lodging, we again passed a night in a very small house, which seemed to
be a very curious one somehow. "Do not sleep! Something unexpected will
happen!" "Don't be frightened!" "Lie down even without breathing!" This
was said and I spent the night in loneliness and dread. I felt that I
lived a thousand years that night, and when the day dawned I saw that
we were in a robbers' den. People said that the mistress of that house
lived by a strange occupation. 

We crossed the Uji River in a high wind and the ferry-boat passed very
near the fishing seine. 

Years have passed and only sounds of waters have come to my ears,
To-day, indeed, I may even count the ripples around the fishing net. 
[This poem may seem a little obscure. It means that her own life had
been lived long in a kind of dreamland of her own creating, but was
gradually emerging into reality.] 

If, as I am doing now, I continue to write down events four or five
years after they have happened, [Page 59]  my life will seem to be that
of a pilgrim, but it is not so. I am jotting down the happenings of
several years. In the spring I went to Kurama Temple. It was a soft
spring day, with mist trailing over the mountain-side. The mountain
people brought tokoro [a kind of root] as the only food and I found it
good. When I left there flowers were already gone. 

In Gods-absent month I went again, and the mountain views along the way
were more beautiful than before, the mountain-side brocaded with the
autumn colours. The stream, rushing headlong, boiled up like molten
metal and then shattered into crystals. 

When I reached the monastery the maple leaves, wet with a shower, were
brilliant beyond compare. 

The pattern of the maple leaves in Autumn dyed with the rain­ 
Beautiful in the deep mountain! 
After two years or so I went again to Ishiyama. It seemed to be
raining, and I heard some one saying rain is disagreeable on a journey,
but on opening the door I found the waning moon lighting even the
depths of the ravine. What I thought rain was the stream rippling below
the roots of the trees. 

The sound of the mountain brook gives an illusion of rain drops, 
Yet the calm of the waning moon shines over all. 
The next time I went to Hasé Temple, my journey was not so solitary as
before. Along the route various persons invited me to ceremonious
dinners, and we made but slow progress. The autumn woods were beautiful
at the Hahasono forest in Yamashiro. I [Page 60]  crossed the Hasé
River. We stayed there for three days. This time we were too many to
lodge in that small house on the other side of the Nara Pass, so we
camped in the field. Our men passed the night lying on mukabaki 1
spread on the grass. They could not sleep for the dew which fell on
their heads. The moon clear and more picturesque than elsewhere. 

Even in our wandering journey, 
The lonely moon accompanies us lighting us from the sky 
The waning moon I used to gaze at in the Royal City. 
As I could do as I liked, I went even to distant temples for worship,
and my heart was consoled through both the pleasures and fatigues of
the way. Though it was half diversion, yet it [her prayers] gave me
hope. I had no pressing sorrow in those days and tried to bring up my
boy in the manner I thought best, and was impatient of passing
time. The man I depended upon [her husband] wished to attain to
happiness like other people, and the future looked promising. A dear
friend of mine, who used to exchange poems with me and continued to
write, through many changes of situation, although not so often as of
old, married the Governor of Echizen and went down to that
Province. After that all communication between us ceased, so I wrote
her a poem finding the means of sending it with great difficulty: 

      Undying affection!
Can it end at last, overlaid with time
Even as snow covers the land in the Northern Province? 
[Page 61]  
She wrote back: 

Even a little pebble does not cease to be, 
Though pressed under the snow of Hakusan; 
So is my affection even though hidden. 
I went down to a hollow of Nishiyama [in the western hills of
Kioto]. There were flowers blooming in confusion. It was beautiful, yet
lonely. There was no sight of man. A tranquil haze enclosed us. 

Far from towns, in the heart of the mountain, 
The cherry blooms, and wastes its blooms away 
With none to see. 
When the sorrow of the World 1 troubled my heart I made a retreat in
the Uzumasa Temple. To me there arrived a letter from one who served
the Princess. While I was answering it the temple bell was heard. 

The outer world of many sorrows
Is not to be forgotten even here. 
At the sound of the evening bell 
Lonely grows my heart. 
To the beautifully tranquil palace of the Princess I went one day to
talk with two congenial friends. The next day, finding life rather
tedious, I thought longingly of them and sent a poem: 2 

Knowing the place of our meeting to be the sea of tears, 
Where memories ripple, and affections flow back, 
Yet we ventured into it­and my longing for you grew stronger than ever. 
One wrote back: 

We ventured into that sea,
To find the pearls of consolement,
No pearls, but drops of sad, sweet tears we found. 
[Page 62]  
And the other: 

Who would venture into the sea of tears 
Seeking for the chance with zealous care, 
Had not the flowers of lovely vision floated in it! 
That friend being of the same mind with me, we used to talk over every
joy and sorrow of the world, but she went down to the Province of
Chikuzen in Kyushu [extreme southwest of old Japan]. On a moon-bright
night I went to bed thinking of her with longing, for in the palace we
had been wont not to sleep on such a night, but to sit up gazing into
the sky. I dreamed that we were in the palace and saw each other as we
had done in reality. I awoke startled; the moon was then near the
western ridge of the mountain and I thought "I would I had not
wakened" 1 [quoting from a famous poem]. 

Tell her, oh, western-going moon,
That dreaming of her I could sleep no more,
But all the night
My pillow was bedewed with loving tears. 
In the Autumn [1056] I had occasion to go down to the Province of
Izumi. 2 From Yodo the journey was very picturesque. We passed a night
at Takahama. It was dark, and in the depths of the night I heard the
sound of an oar, and was told that a singer had come. My companions
called her boat to come alongside ours. She was lighted by a distant
fire, her sleeves [Page 63]  were long, she shaded her face with a fan
and sung. She was charming. The next evening, when the sun was still on
the mountain-top, we passed the beach of Sumiyoshi. It was seen all in
mist, and pine branches, the surface of the sea, and the beach where
waves rolled up, combined to make a scene more beautiful than a
picture. 

It is an evening of Autumn 
­The seashore of Sumiyoshi! 
Can words describe it? 
What can be compared with it? 
Even after the boat was towed along, I looked back again and again,
never satiated. 

In the Winter I returned to Kioto. We took our boat at Oé Bay. That
night a tempest raged with such fury that the very rocks seemed to be
shaken. The god of Thunder 1 came roaring, and the sound of dashing
waves, the tumult of the wind, the horrors of the sea, made me feel
that life was coming to an end. But they dragged the boat ashore, where
we spent the night. The rain stopped, but not the wind, and we could
not start. We passed five or six days on these wide-stretching
sands. When the wind had gone down a little, I looked out, rolling up
the curtain of my cabin. The evening tide was rising swiftly and cranes
called to each other in the bay. 

People of the Province came in crowds to see us, and said that if the
boat had been outside the bay that night it would have been seen no
more. Even the thought terrified me. [Page 64]  

Off Ishitsu, in the wild sea 
The boat driven before the storm 
Fades away and is seen no more. 
The wild gusts drive the boat­ 
Into the wild sea she disappears­ 
      Off Ishitsu! 

I devoted myself in various ways for the World [her husband]. Even in
serving at Court one had likewise to devote one's self
unceasingly. What favor could one win by returning to the parents' home
from time to time? 

As I advanced in age I felt it unbecoming to behave as young couples
do. While I was lamenting I grew ill, and could not go out to temples
for worship. Even this rare going out was stopped, and I had no hope of
living long, but I wanted to give my younger children a safer position
while I was alive. 

I grieved and waited for the delightful thing [an appointment] for my
husband. In Autumn he got a position, 1 but not so good a one as we had
hoped, and we were much disappointed. It was not so distant as the
place from which he had returned, so he made up his mind to go, and we
hastily made preparations. He started from the house where his daughter
had recently gone to live. 2 It was after the tenth of the Gods-absent
month. I could not know what had happened after he started, but all
seemed happy on [Page 65]  that day. He was accompanied by our boy. My
husband wore a red coat and pale purple kimono, 1 and aster-coloured
hakama [divided skirt], and carried a long sword. The boy wore blue
figured clothes and red hakama, and they mounted their horses beside
the veranda. 

When they had gone out noisily I felt very, very lonely. As I had heard
the Province was not so distant I was less hopeless than I had been
before. 

The people who accompanied him to see him off returned the next day and
told me that they had gone down with great show [of splendour] and,
then continuing, said they had seen human fire 2 this morning starting
[from the company] and flying towards the Capital. I tried to suppose
it to be from some one of his retinue. How could I think the worst? I
could think of nothing but how to bring up these younger ones. 

He came back in the Deutzia month of the next year and passed the
Summer and Autumn at home, and on the twenty-fifth of the Long-night
month he became ill. 


1058. On the fifth day of the Tenth month all became like a dream. 3 My
sorrows could be compared to nothing in this world. 

Now I knew that my present state had been re- [Page 66]  flected in the
mirror offered to the Hasé Temple [about twenty-five years before by
her mother] where some one was seen weeping in agony. The reflection of
the happier one had not been realized. That could never be in the
future. 

On the twenty-third we burnt his remains with despairing hearts, my
boy, who went down with him last Autumn, being dressed exquisitely and
much attended, followed the bier weeping in black clothes with hateful
things [mourning insignia] on them. My feeling when I saw him going out
can never be expressed. I seemed to wander in dreams and thought that
human life must soon cease here. If I had not given myself up to idle
fictions [she herself had written several] and poetry, but had
practiced religious austerities night and day, I would not have seen
such a dream-world. 

At Hasé Temple a cedar branch was cast down to me by the Inari god and
this thing [the loss of her husband] would not have happened if I had
visited the Inari shrine on my way home. The dreams which I had seen in
these past years which bid me pray to the Heaven Illuminating Honoured
Goddess meant that I should have been in the Imperial Court as a nurse,
sheltered behind the favour of the King and Queen­so the dream
interpreter interpreted my dream, but I could not realize this. Only
the sorrowful reflection in the mirror was realized unaltered. O
pitiful and sorrowful I ! Thus nothing could happen as I willed, and I
wandered in this world doing no virtuous deed for the future
life. [Page 67]  

Life seemed to survive sorrows, but I was uneasy at the thought that
things would happen against my will, even in the future life. There was
only one thing I could rely on. 

Ceaseless tears­clouded mind: 
Bright scene­moon-shadow. 
On the thirteenth of the Tenth month [1055] I dreamed one night this
dream: 

There in the garden of my house at the farthest ledge stood Amitabha
Buddha! He was not seen distinctly, but as if through a cloud. I could
snatch a glimpse now and then when the cloud lifted. The lotus-flower
pedestal was three or four feet above the ground; the Buddha was about
six feet high. 

Golden light shone forth; one hand was extended, the fingers of the
other were bent in form of benediction. None but I could see him, yet I
felt such reverence that I dared not approach the blind to see him
better. None but I might hear him saying, "Then this time I will go
back, and afterwards come again to receive you." I was startled and
awoke into the fourteenth day. This dream only was my hope for the life
to come. 1 

I had lived with my husband's nephews, but after that sad event we
parted not to meet again. One very dark night I was visited by the
nephew who was living at Rokuhara; I could not but welcome so rare a
guest. [Page 68]  

No moon, and darkness deepens
Around Obásuté. Why have you come?
It cannot be to see the moon! 1 
After that time [the death of her husband] an intimate friend stopped
all communication. 

She may be thinking that I 
Am no more in this world, yet my days 
Are wasted in weeping. 
Weeping, alas! 
In the Tenth month I turned, my eyes full of tears, towards the
intensely bright moon. 

Even into the mind always clouded with grief, 
There is cast the reflection of the bright moon. 
Years and months passed away. Whenever I recollected the dream-like
incident [of his death] my mind was troubled and my eyes filled so that
I cannot think distinctly of those days. 

My people went to live elsewhere and I remained alone in my solitary
home. I was tired of meditation and sent a poem to one who had not
called on me for a long time. 

Weeds grow before my gate 
And my sleeves are wet with dew, 
No one calls on me, 
My tears are solitary­alas! 
She was a nun and she sent an answer: 

The weeds before a dwelling house 
  May remind you of me! 
Bushes bury the hut 
Where lives the world-deserted one.

3 In the Isé-monogatari (a book of Narihira's poetical works) the
Sumida River is said to be on the boundary between Musashi and
Shimofusa. So the italicized words seem to be the authoress's mis-
[Page 10] take, or more probably an insertion by a later smatterer of
literary knowledge who inherited the manuscript. 
Narihira's poem is addressed to a sea-gull called Miyakodori, which
literally means bird of the capital. Narihira had abandoned Kioto and
was wandering towards the East. Just then his heart had been yearning
after the Royal City and also after his wife, and that feeling must
have been intensified by the name of the bird. (Cf. The Isé-monogatari,
Section 9.) 

Miyakodori! alas, that word
  Fills my heart again with longing,
Even you I ask, O bird,
  Does she still live, my beloved?

1 According to "Sagami-Fudoki," or "The Natural Feature of Sagami
Province," this district was in ancient times inhabited by Koreans. The
natives could not distinguish a Korean from a Chinese, hence the name
of Chinese Field. A temple near Oiso still keeps the name of Koraiji,
or the Korean temple.

1 This seems to be the last line of a kind of song called Imayo,
perhaps improvised by the singers; its meaning may be as follows: "You
compare us with singers of the Western Provinces; we are inferior to
those in the Royal City; we may justly be compared with those in
Osaka."

1 In October it was the custom for all local gods to go for a
conference to the residence of the oldest native god, in the Province
of Idzumo; hence, Gods-absent month. This Province of Idzumo, full of
the folklore of old Japan, has become well known to the world through
the writings of Lafcadio Hearn. 
[Page 22] 

1 According to the superstition of those days people believed that
every house was presided over by an earth god, which occupied the
hearth in Spring, the gate in Summer, the well in Autumn, and the
garden in Winter. It was dangerous to meet him when he changed his
abode. So on that day the dwellers went out from their houses. 
[Page 23] 

1 Readers are urged to read the delightful essay of Lafcadio Hearn
called "The Romance of the Milky Way" (Chogonka). Here it must suffice
to relate the story of "Tanabata-himé" and the herdsman. Tanabata-tsume
was the daughter of the god of the sky. She rejoiced to weave garments
for her father and had no greater pleasure [Page 24] than that, until
one day Hikiboshi, a young herdsman, leading an ox, passed by her
door. Divining her love for him, her father gave his daughter the young
herdsman for her husband, and all went well, until the young couple
grew too fond of each other and the weaving was neglected. Thereupon
the great god was displeased and "they were sentenced to live apart
with the Celestial River between them," but in pity of their love they
were permitted to meet one night a year, on the seventh day of the
Seventh month. On that night the herdsman crosses the River of Heaven
where Tanabata-tsume is waiting for him on the other side, but woe
betide if the night is cloudy or rainy! Then the waters of the River of
Heaven rise, and the lovers must wait full another year before the boat
can cross. 
Many of our beautiful poems have been written on this legend; sometimes
it is Tanabata-himé who is waiting for her lord, sometimes it is
Hikiboshi who speaks. The festival has been celebrated for 1100 years
in Japan, and there is no country village which does not sing these
songs on the seventh night of the Seventh month, and make offerings to
the star gods of little poems tied to the freshly cut bamboo branches.

2 This scene will be better understood by the reader if he remembers
that her father was in the street in the midst of his train of
attendants­an imposing cavalcade of bow-men, warriors, and attendants
of all sorts, with palanquins and luggage, prepared to make a two or
three months' journey through the wilderness to the Province of
Hitachi, far in the East. She, as a Japanese lady could not go out to
speak to him, but unconventionally she had drawn up the blind and "her
eye met his."

II
THE DIARY OF MURASAKI SHIKIBU 1 
AD. 1007-1010
As the autumn season approaches the Tsuchimikado 2 becomes
inexpressibly smile-giving. The tree-tops near the pond, the bushes
near the stream, are dyed in varying tints whose colours grow deeper in
the mellow light of evening. The murmuring sound of waters mingles all
the night through with the never-ceasing recitation 3 of sutras which
appeal more to one's heart as the breezes grow cooler. 

The ladies waiting upon her honoured presence are talking idly. The
Queen hears them; she must find them annoying, but she conceals it
calmly. Her beauty needs no words of mine to praise it, but I cannot
help feeling that to be near so beautiful a queen will be the only
relief from my sorrow. So in spite of my better desires [for a
religious life] I am here. Nothing else dispels my grief 4­it is
wonderful! 


It is still the dead of night, the moon is dim and darkness lies under
the trees. We hear an officer call, [Page 72]  "The outer doors of the
Queen's apartment must be opened. The maids-of-honour are not yet
come­let the Queen's secretaries come forward! " While this order is
being given the three-o'clock bell resounds, startling the
air. Immediately the prayers at the five altars 1 begin. The voices of
the priests in loud recitation, vying with each other far and near, are
solemn indeed. The Abbot of the Kanon-in Temple, accompanied by twenty
priests, comes from the eastern 2 side building to pray. Even their
footsteps along the gallery which sound to'-do-ro to'-do-ro are
sacred. The head priest of the Hoju Temple goes to the mansion near the
race-track, the prior of the Henji Temple goes to the library. I follow
with my eyes when the holy figures in pure white robes cross the
stately Chinese bridge and walk along the broad path. Even Azaliah
Saisa bends the body in reverence before the deity Daiitoku. The
maids-of-honour arrive at dawn. 


I can see the garden from my room beside the entrance to the
gallery. The air is misty, the dew is still on the leaves. The Lord
Prime Minister is walking there; he orders his men to cleanse the
brook. He breaks off a stalk of omenaishi [flower maiden] which is in
full bloom by the south end of the bridge. He peeps in over my
screen! His noble appearance embarrasses us, and I am ashamed of my
morning [not yet painted and powdered] face. He says, "Your poem on
this! If you delay so much the fun is gone!" 

[Facing Page] 


OLD PRINT OF A NOBLEMAN'S DWELLING IN THE AZUMAYA STYLE
The Tsuchimikado, or Prime Minister's mansion, must have been like
this.

[Page 73]  and I seize the chance to run away to the writing-box,
hiding my face­ 

Flower-maiden in bloom­ 
Even more beautiful for the bright dew, 
Which is partial, and never favors me. 
"So prompt!" said he, smiling, and ordered a writing-box to be brought
[for himself]. 

His answer: 

The silver dew is never partial. 
From her heart 
The flower-maiden's beauty. 

One wet and calm evening I was talking with Lady Saisho. The young Lord
1 of the Third Rank sat with the misu 2 partly rolled up. He seemed
maturer than his age and was very graceful. Even in light conversation
such expressions as "Fair soul is rarer than fair face" come gently to
his lips, covering us with confusion. It is a mistake to treat him like
a young boy. He keeps his dignity among ladies, and I saw in him a
much-sought-after romantic hero when once he walked off reciting to
himself: 

Linger in the field where flower-maidens are blooming
And your name will be tarnished with tales of gallantry. 
Some such trifle as that sometimes lingers in my mind when really
interesting things are soon forgotten­why ? [Page 74]  


Nowadays people are carrying pretty folding fans 

Since the twentieth of the Eighth month, the more favoured court nobles
and officers have been on night duty, passing the nights in the
corridor, or on the mats of the veranda idly amusing themselves. Young
men who are unskilled in koto or fué [harp or flute] amuse themselves
with tonearasoi 1 and imayo, 2 and at such a time this is
entertaining. Narinobu, the Queen's Grand Chamberlain, Tsunefusa, the
Lieutenant-General of the Left Bodyguard and State Councillor, and
Narimasa, the Major-General of the Bodyguard and Governor of Mino,
passed the night in diversions. The Lord Prime Minister must have been
apprehensive, for he has forbidden all public entertainment. Those who
have long retired from the court have come in crowds to ask after the
Queen's welfare, so we have had no peace. 


Twenty-sixth day. We finished the preparation of perfume 3 and
distributed it to all. A number of us who had been making it into balls
assembled together. On my way from Her Majesty's chamber I peeped into
Ben Saisho's room. She was sleeping. She wore garments of hagi 4 and
shion 4 over which she had put a strongly perfumed lustrous robe. Her
face was [Page 75]  hidden behind the cloth; 1 her head rested on a
writing-case of gold lacquer. Her forehead was beautiful and
fascinating. She seemed like a princess in a picture. I took off the
cloth which hid her mouth and said, "You are just like the heroine of a
romance!" She blushed, half rising; she was beauty itself. She is
always beautiful, but on this occasion her charm was wonderfully
heightened. 


Dear Lady Hyoé brought me some floss 2 silk for chrysanthemums. "The
wife of the Prime Minister favours you with this present to drive away
age, 2 carefully use it and then throw it away." 

May that lady live one thousand years who guards the flowers! 
My sleeves are wet with thankful tears
As though I had been working
In a garden of dewy chrysanthemums. 
I wanted to send it, but as I heard that she had gone away I kept it. 


The evening I went to the Queen's chamber. As the moon was beautiful,
skirts overflowed from beneath the misu. 3 By and by there came Lady
Koshosho and Lady Dainagon. Her Majesty took out some of the perfume
made the other day and put it into an incense burner to try it. The
garden was admirable­"When [Page 76]  the ivy leaves become red!" they
were saying­but our Lady seemed less tranquil than usual. The priests
came for prayers, and I went into the inside room but was called away
and finally went to my own chamber. I wanted only to rest a few
minutes, but fell asleep. By midnight everybody was in great
excitement. 


Tenth day of the Long-moon month. 

When day began to dawn the decorations 1 of the Queen's chamber were
changed and she removed to a white bed. The Prime Minister, his sons,
and other noblemen made haste to change the curtains of the screens,
the bed cover, and other things. 1 All day long she lay ill at
ease. Men cried at the top of their voices to scare away evil
spirits. There assembled not only the priests who had been summoned
here for these months, but also itinerant monks who were brought from
every mountain and temple. Their prayers would reach to the Buddhas of
the three worlds. All the soothsayers in the world were summoned. Eight
million gods seemed to be listening with ears erect for their Shinto
prayers. Messengers ran off to order sutra-reciting at various
temples; thus the night was passed. On the east side of the screen
[placed around the Queen's bed] there assembled the ladies of the
Court. On the west side there were lying the Queen's substitutes
possessed with [or who were enticing] the evil spirits. 2 Each was
lying surrounded by a pair of [Page 77]  folding screens. The joints of
the screens were curtained and priests were appointed to cry sutras
there. On the south side there sat in many rows abbots and other
dignitaries of the priesthood, who prayed and swore till their voices
grew hoarse, as if they were bringing down the living form of Fudo. 1
The space between the north room and the dais [on which was the Queen's
bed] was very narrow, yet when I thought of it afterwards I counted
more than forty persons who were standing there. They could not move at
all, and grew so dizzy that they could remember nothing. The people
[i.e. the ladies-in-waiting and maids-of-honour] now coming from
home. could not enter the main apartment at all. There was no place for
their flowing robes and long sleeves. Certain older women wept
secretly. 

Eleventh day. At dawn the north sliding doors were taken away to throw
the two rooms together. The Queen was moved towards the veranda. As
there was no time to hang misu, she was surrounded by kicho. The
Reverend Gyocho and the other priests performed incantations. The
Reverend Ingen recited the prayer written by the Lord Prime Minister on
the previous day adding some grave vows of his own. His words were
infinitely august and hopeful. The Prime Minister joining in the
prayer, we felt more assured [Page 78]  of a fortunate delivery. Yet
there was still lingering anxiety which made us very sad, and many eyes
were filled with tears. We said, "Tears are not suitable to this
occasion," but we could not help crying. They said that Her Majesty
suffered more because the rooms were too crowded, so the people were
ordered to the south and east rooms. After this there remained in the
Royal Apartment only the more important personages. The Prime Minister,
Lady Sanuki, and Lady Saisho were within the [Royal] screen. The
honoured priest of Ninna Temple and the court priest of Mii Temple were
summoned within. The Prime Minister gave various commands, and his
voice overpowered those of the priests. There were also Ladies
Dainagon, Koshosho, Miya-no-Naishi, Nakatsukasa-no-Kimi, Tayu-no-Myobu,
Daishikibu-no-Omoto, Tono-no-Senji­these last were venerable ladies of
experience, but even they were bewildered with good reason. I am yet a
novice, and I felt with all my heart that the occasion was
serious. Also, in the place a little behind, outside the curtain, there
were the nurses of the Princesses Naishi-no-Kami and Nakatsukasa, of
the Queen's sister Shonagon, and of her younger sister Koshikibu. These
nurses forced their way into the narrow passage behind the two screens
and there walked back and forth, so that none could pass that
way. There were many other persons bustling about, but I could not
distinguish them. The Prime Minister's son, Lieutenant-General Saisho,
Major-General Masamichi of the Fourth Rank, not to speak of
Lieutenant-General Tsunefusa, of the Left [Page 79]  Bodyguard, and
Miya-no-Tayu, who had not known Her Majesty familiarly, all looked over
her screen for some time. They showed eyes swollen up with weeping
[over her sufferings], forgetting the shame of it. On their heads rice
1 was scattered white as snow. Their rumpled clothes must have been
unseemly, but we could only think of those things afterward. A part of
the Queen's head was shaved. 2 I was greatly astonished and very sorry
to see it, but she was delivered peacefully. The after-birth was
delayed, and all priests crowded to the south balcony, under the eaves
of the magnificent main building, while those on the bridge recited
sutras more passionately, often kneeling. 

Among the ladies-in-waiting on the east side were seen some of the
courtiers. 3 Lady Kochujo's eye met that of the
Lieutenant-General. People afterwards laughed over her astonished
expression. She is a very fascinating and elegant person, and is always
very careful to adorn her face. This morning she had done so, but her
eyes were red, and her rouge was spoiled by tears. She was disfigured,
and hardly seemed the same person. The imperfectly made-up face of Lady
Saisho was a rare sight, but what about my own? It is lucky for me that
people cannot notice such things at such a time. [Page 80]  

As the after-birth came, it was fearful to hear the jealously swearing
voices of the evil spirits. Shinzo-Azari took charge of Lady
Ben-no-Kurodo; Soyo took charge of Hyoé-no-Kurodo; a priest Hojuji took
charge of Ukon-no-Kurodo; 1 Chiso Azari took charge of Lady
Miya-no-Naishi. This last priest was overpowered with the evil spirit,
and as he was in a too pitiable state Ninkaku Azari went to help
him. It was not because his prayer had little virtue, but the [evil]
spirit was too strong. Priest Eiko was in charge of Lady Saisho's
supplicator of the spirit [i.e. Queen's substitute]. This priest swore
all night till his voice became hoarse. Most ladies who were summoned
in order that the spirits might enter into them remained safe, and they
were much troubled [thinking that it would be to the Queen's advantage
were they attacked]. At noon we felt that the sun came out at last. The
Queen was at ease! 


She is now at peace. Incomparable joy! Moreover, it is a prince, so the
joy cannot be oblique. The court ladies who had passed the previous day
in anxiety, not knowing what to do, as if they were lost in the mist of
the early morning, went one by one to rest in their own rooms, so that
before the Queen there remained only some elderly persons proper for
such occasions. The Lord Prime Minister and his Lady went away to give
offerings to the priest who had read sutras and performed religious
austerities during the past months, and to those doctors who were
recently [Page 81]  summoned. The doctors and soothsayers, who had
invented special forms of efficacy, were given pensions. Within the
house they were perhaps preparing for the ceremony of bathing the
child. 


Large packages [of ceremonial clothes 1] were carried to the apartments
of the ladies-in-waiting. Karaginu 2 and embroidered 2 trains were
worn. Some wore dazzlingly brilliant trains embroidered and ornamented
with mother-of-pearl. Some lamented that the fans which had been
ordered had not come. They all painted and powdered. When I looked from
the bridge I saw Her Majesty's first officials, and the highest
officers of His Highness the Crown Prince [the newborn child] and other
court nobles. The Prime Minister went out to have the brook, which had
been choked with mud, cleaned3 out. 


All the people seem happy. Even those who have some cause for
melancholy are overtaken by the general joy. The First Official of our
Queen has naturally seemed happier than anybody, though he does not
show special smiles of self-satisfaction and pride. 

The Lieutenant-General of the Light Bodyguard has been joking with the
King's Adviser of the Middle Rank, sitting on a mat on the balcony of
the side building. The sword of His Highness the young Prince has been
brought from the Imperial Court. [Page 82]  The Lieutenant-General, and
First Secretary Yorisada, on his way home from the shrine at Isé 1
where he had gone as Imperial Messenger to offer nusa, 2 stopped at the
gate [as he could not enter the house 3] to inquire for Her Majesty. He
was given some present, I did not see it. 


The navel cord was cut by the Prime Minister's Lady. Lady Tachibana of
the Third Rank gave the breast for the first time [ceremonial]. For the
wet-nurse Daisaémon-no-Omoto was chosen, for she has been in the Court
a long time and is very familiar with it; the daughter of Munetoki,
courtier and Governor of Bitchu, and the nurse of Kurodo-no-Ben were
also chosen as nurses. 


The ceremony of bathing was performed at six o'clock in the
evening. The bath was lighted [by torches]. The Queen's maid in white
over green prepared the hot water. The stand for the bathtub was
covered with white cloth. 

Chikamitsu, Governor of Owari [Province], and Nakanobu, the Head
Officer attached to the Queen, presented themselves before the
misu. [Page 83]  

There were two stands for kettles. 

Lady Kyoiko and Lady Harima poured the cold water. Two ladies, Omoku
and Uma, selected sixteen jars from among those into which the hot
water was poured [choosing the purest]. These ladies wore gauze outer
garments, fine silk trains, karaginu, and saishi. 1 Their hair was tied
by white cords which gave the head a very fair look. In the bath Lady
Saisho became the partner of bathing [i.e. entered the bath with the
royal infant]. Lady Dainagon in her bathing-dress­she was especially
beautiful in this rare costume. The Lord Prime Minister took the August
Prince in his arms; Lady Koshosho held the sword, and Lady
Miya-no-Naishi held up a tiger's head before the Prince. 2 Lady
Miya-no-Naishi wore karaginu with a pattern of pine cones. Her train
was woven in a marine design of sea-weeds, waves, etc.; on the belt a
vine-pattern was embroidered. Lady Koshosho wore an embroidered belt
with a pattern of autumn leaves, butterflies, and birds, which was
bright with silver thread. Brocade was forbidden except for persons of
high rank and they used it only for the belt. Two sons of the Prime
Minister and Major-General Minamoto Masamichi were scattering rice in
great excitement.3 "I will make the most noise," each shouted to the
other. The priest of Henchi Temple presented himself to protect the
August Child. The rice hit him on his eyes and ears so he held [Page
84]  out his fan and the young people laughed at him. The Doctor of
Literature, Kurodo Ben-no-Hironari, stood at the foot of the high
corridor and read the first book of Sikki [historical records]. Twenty
bow-string men twanged the bow-string to scare away evil spirits, they
were ten men of the fifth, and ten men of the sixth degree [of rank]
arranged in two rows. The same ceremonies of bathing were repeated in
the evening. Only the Doctor of Literature was changed. Doctor
Munetoki, Governor of Isé, read the Kokyo [book on filial piety], and
Takachika read a chapter of Buntei [in the Historical Records of
Chinese Kings]. 


For seven nights every ceremony was performed cloudlessly. Before the
Queen in white the styles and colours of other people's dresses
appeared in sharp contrast. 1 I felt much dazzled and abashed, and did
not present myself in the daytime, so I passed my days in tranquillity
and watched persons going up from the eastern side building across the
bridge. Those who were permitted to wear the honourable colours 2 put
on brocaded karaginu, 3 and also brocaded uchigi. This was the
conventionally beautiful dress, not showing individual taste. The
elderly ladies who could not wear the honourable colours avoided
anything [Page 85]  dazzling, but took only exquisite uchigi 1 trimmed
with three or five folds, 2 and for karaginu brocade either of one
colour or of a simple design. For their inner kimonos they used figured
stuffs or gauzes. Their fans, though not at first glance brilliant or
attractive, had some written phrases or sentiments in good taste, but
almost exactly alike, as if they had compared notes beforehand. In
point of fact the resemblance came from their similarity of age, and
they were individual efforts. Even in those fans were revealed their
minds which are in jealous rivalry. The younger ladies wore
much-embroidered clothes; even their sleeve openings were
embroidered. The pleats of their trains were ornamented with thick
silver thread and they put gold foil on the brocaded figures of the
silk. Their fans were like a snow-covered mountain in bright
moonlight; they sparkled and could not be looked at steadily. They were
like hanging mirrors [in those days made of polished metal]. 


On the third night Her Majesty's major-domo gave an entertainment. He
served the Queen himself. The [Page 86]  dining-table of aloe wood, the
silver dishes, and other things I saw hurriedly. Minamoto Chunagon and
Saisho presented the Queen with some baby clothes and diapers, a stand
for a clothes chest, and cloth for wrapping up clothes and
furniture. They were white in colour, and all of the same shape; yet
they were carefully chosen, showing the artist mind. The Governor of
Omi Province was busy with the general management of the banquet. On
the western balcony of the East building there sat court nobles in two
rows, the north being the more honourable place. On the southern
balcony were court officials, the west being the most honourable
seat. Outside the doors of the principal building [where the Queen was]
white figured-silk screens were put. 


On the fifth night the Lord Prime Minister celebrated the birth. The
full moon on the fifteenth day was clear and beautiful. Torches were
lighted under the trees and tables were put there with rice-balls on
them. Even the uncouth humble servants who were walking about
chattering seemed to enhance the joyful scene. All minor officials were
there burning torches, making it as bright as day. Even the attendants
of the nobles, who gathered behind the rocks and under the trees,
talked of nothing but the new light which had come into the world, and
were smiling and seemed happy as if their own private wishes had been
fulfilled. Happier still seemed those in the Audience Chamber, from the
highest nobles even to men of the fifth rank, who, scarcely to be
counted [Page 87]  among the nobility, met the joyful time going about
idly, and bending their bodies busily [i.e. obsequiously]. 

To serve at the Queen's dinner eight ladies tied their hair with white
cords, and in that dress brought in Her Majesty's dining-table. The
chief lady-in-waiting for that night was Miya-no-Naishi. She was
brilliantly dressed with great formality, and her hair was made more
charming by the white cords which enhanced her beauty. I got a side
glance of her when her face was not screened by her fan. She wore a
look of extreme purity. 


The following are the maids-of-honour who tied their hair; Minamoto
Shikibu, daughter of the Governor of Kaga Province; Kozaémon, daughter
of the late Michitoki, Governor of Bitchu; Kohyoé, daughter of Akimasa,
Governor of the Left Capital; Osuké, daughter of Sukechika, the head
priest of the Isé shrine; O Uma, daughter of Yorinobu, an officer of
the Right Bodyguard; Ko Uma, daughter of Michinobu, an officer of the
Left Bodyguard; Kohyoé, daughter of Naritaka, Recorder of the
Capital; Komoku [or Dakumi], daughter of Nobuyoshi. These were all
young and pretty. It was a sight worth seeing. This time, as they chose
only the best-looking young ladies, the rest who used to tie their hair
on ordinary occasions to serve the Queen's dinner wept bitterly; it was
shocking to see them. 

More than thirty ladies were sitting in the two rooms east of the
Queen's canopy, a magnificent sight. The [Page 88]  august dinner trays
were carried by unemé. 1 Near the entrance of the great chamber folding
screens surrounded a pair of tables on which these dining-trays had
been placed. As the night advanced the moon shone brightly. There were
unemé, mohitori, 2 migusiagé, 3 tonomori, 4 kanmori-no-nyokwan, 5 ­some
with whose faces I was not familiar. There were also door keepers,
carelessly dressed and with hairpins falling out, crowded together
towards the eastern corridor of the principal building as if it were a
public holiday. There were so many people there was no getting through
them. After dinner the maids-of-honour came outside the misu and could
be plainly seen by the light of the torches. The train and karaginu of
Lady Oshikibu was embroidered to represent the dwarf pine-wood at Mount
Oshio. As she is the wife of Michinoku, Governor of the eastern
extremity of the island, she serves now in the Prime Minister's
household. Dayu-no-Miyobu neglected the ornamentation of her karaginu,
but she adorned her train with silver dust representing sea-waves. It
was pleasing to the eye, though not dazzling. Ben-no-Naishi showed on
her train a beach with cranes on it painted in silver. It was something
new. She had also embroidered pine branches; she is clever, for all
these things are emblematic of a long life. The device of Lady Shosho
was inferior to [Page 89]  these­many laughed at her silver foil. She
was sister to Sukemitsu, the Governor of Shinano, and has lived at the
court a long time. People wanted to see this entertainment. A priest
was there who used to attend the court to beguile the night with
religious and other stories. I said to him, "You cannot see such a
lovely thing every day." "Indeed! indeed!" said he, neglecting his
Buddha and clapping his hands for joy. The court nobles rose from their
seats and went to the steps [descending from the balcony]. His Lordship
the Prime Minister and others cast da. 1 It was shocking to see them
quarrelling about paper. Some [others] composed poems. A lady said,
"What response shall we make if some one offers to drink saké with
us?" We tried to think of something. 2 [Page 90]  

Shijo-no-Dainagon is a man of varied accomplishments. No ladies can
rival him in repartee, much less compete with him in poetry, so they
were all afraid of him, but [this evening] he did not give a cup to any
particular lady to make her compose poems. Perhaps that was because he
had many things to do and it was getting late. At this ceremony the
ladies of high rank are given robes, together with babies' dresses
presented by the Queen. The ladies of the fourth rank were each given a
lined kimono, and those of the sixth rank were given hakama. 1 So much
I saw. 


The next night the moon was very beautiful. As it is the delightful
season, young people went boating. They were all dressed uniformly in
white and their hair showed better than when they wear coloured
clothes. Kotaibu, Minamoto Shikibu, Miyaki-no-Jiju, Gosechi-no-Ben,
Ukon, Kohyoé, Koeimon, Uma, Yasurahi, Isebito­these were on the veranda
when the Lieutenant-General of the Left Bodyguard, and the
Lieutenant-General, the Prime Minister's son, came to take them out in
the boat punted by Lieutenant-General Kanetaka of the Right
Bodyguard. The rest of the ladies were neglected and followed them with
their eyes. They seemed to be jealous in spite of themselves. Into the
very white garden 2 the moon shone down and added to the beauty of the
maids-of-honour in their white dresses. There were many palanquins
waiting at the shelter [for con-

[Page 91]  veyances] near the north entrance. They were those of the
ladies-in-waiting of His Majesty's court, Tosaumi, Koshosho, Uma, Ukon,
Chikuzen, Omi­so far I have heard, but as I don't know them well there
may be some mistakes. The people in the boat came in in confusion
[hearing that visitors from the King's Court had arrived]. The Lord
Prime Minister came out to welcome them and put them in good humour. He
seemed to be perfectly happy. Gifts were made to them according to
their rank. 


On the seventh day His Majesty celebrated the birth. His secretary and
Major-General, Michimasa, came as King's Messenger with a long list [of
the presents] put into a wicker box. A letter was immediately sent from
the Queen to the King. The students from the Kangakuin 1 came keeping
step. The list of visitors' names was presented to Her Majesty. Some
may perhaps receive gifts. 


The ceremony of the evening was noisier than ever. I peeped under the
Queen's canopy. She who is esteemed by the people as the mother of the
nation did not seem to be in good spirits. She appeared a little
weary. She had grown thinner, and her appearance in bed was slenderer,
younger, and gracefuller. A little lantern was hung under the canopy
which chased the darkness away even from the corners. Her fair
complexion was pale and transparently pure. I thought [Page 92]  her
abundant hair would be better tied up. There is great impropriety in
writing about her at all, so I will stop here. 

The general ceremonies were the same as the other day. The gifts to the
courtiers were bestowed from within the misu. The women's dresses and
the Queen's dress [perhaps from the Queen's wardrobe] were added to
them. The chief of the King's secretaries and court nobles received
them, approaching the misu. 

His Majesty's gifts were uchigi, and kimonos, and rolls of silk in the
usual court fashion. 1 The gifts to Tachibana-no-Sanmi [who offered the
breast to the young Prince for the first time] were a set of women's
clothes and rolls of brocade, a silver clothes chest, and wrappings for
clothes [which perhaps were white]. I have heard that something wrapped
up was added also, though I could not see it in detail. 


On the eighth day all changed their dress [which had been white, the
colour of purification]. On the ninth evening the Vice-Governor 2 of
the August Crown Prince's retinue celebrated the birth. The present was
put on a white cabinet. The ceremony was quite in the new style. On the
silver clothes chest a raised ornament was carved, and the island of
Horai 3 [Page 93]  was also represented as usual, but in finer and
newer fashion. I am sorry I cannot describe it all exactly. This
evening the winter screens were used, and the ladies wore richly
coloured dresses. They seemed all the more charming as it was the first
time after the birth [to see them]. The rich and brilliant colours
shone through the karaginu. The women's figures also showed more
distinctly and that enhanced their beauty. This was the night that Lady
Komano-no-Omoto was put to shame. 


It was after the tenth day of the Gods-absent month, but the Queen
could not leave her bed. So night and day ladies attended her in her
apartment towards the West. The Lord Prime Minister visited her both
during the night and at dawn. He examined the breasts of the
wet-nurses. Those nurses who were in a sound sleep were much startled
and got up while still asleep; it was quite a pity to see them. He very
naturally devoted himself with the utmost care, while there was anxiety
about the August Child. Sometimes the Honourable Infant did a very
unreasonable thing and wet the Lord Prime Minister's clothes. He,
loosening his sash, dried his dress behind the screen. He said: "Ah
! it is a very happy thing to be wet by the Prince. When I am drying my
clothes is my most comfortable moment!" So he said rejoicing. He
especially favoured Prince Murakami, and as he thinks I am related to
that Prince he talked to me very fa- [Page 94]  miliarly. I know many
things which may be expected to happen! 1 


The day of the King's visit was approaching, and the Lord's mansion was
improved and adorned. Beautiful chrysanthemums were sought for
everywhere, to plant in the garden. Some were already fading, others in
yellow were especially lovely. When they were planted and I saw them
through the shifting morning mists, they seemed indeed to drive away
old age. 


I wish I could be more adaptable and live more gaily in the present
world­had I not an extraordinary sorrow­but whenever I hear delightful
or interesting things my yearning for a religious life grows
stronger. I become melancholy and lament. I try to forget, for sorrow
is vain. Am I too sinful? So I was musing one morning when I saw
waterfowl playing heedlessly in the pond. 2 

Waterfowl floating on the water­
They seem so gay,
But in truth
It is not gay to live anxiously seeking means of existence. 
I sympathized with them who outwardly have no other thought but
amusement, yet in reality are seeking a livelihood in great
anxiety. [Page 95]  


Lady Koshosho sent me a letter, and when I was writing the answer a
brisk shower came pattering down. The sky looked threatening and the
messenger was in a hurry, so I think I wrote but a broken-legged
poem. After dark the messenger returned with a strongly perfumed and
deeply coloured paper 1 on which was written: 

The dark sky dulls my dreamy mind, 
The down-dripping rain lingers­ 
O my tears down falling, longing after thee! 
I have forgotten what I wrote to her except the poem: 

There are pauses between the showers of the outer world,
But there is no time when my sleeves, wet with tears, are dry. 

That day the Queen saw the new boats which were presented for her
inspection. The dragon's head and the phoenix at the prow made me think
of animated living figures. 

The visit 2 of His Majesty was to be made at eight or nine o'clock in
the morning. From early dawn ladies adorned themselves with great
care. As the seats of the courtiers were placed in the west side
building the Queen's apartment was not so much disturbed. I have heard
that the ladies serving at the Imperial shrine dressed very elaborately
in the rooms of the first maid-of-honour. 

In the early morning Lady Koshosho came back [Page 96]  from her
father's. We dressed our hair together. In spite of the fixed hour His
Majesty's coming will be delayed, we thought, and our relaxed minds
were still indolent. Some ladies had ordered unornamented silk fans and
were on tiptoe with expectancy when the drums were heard [announcing
Royalty] and they were in an awkward predicament. 1 We welcomed the
Royal equipage. The boatmen's music was very good. When the Royal
palanquin drew near, the bearers, though they were rather honourable
persons, bent their heads in absolute humility as they ascended the
steps. Even in the highest society there are grades of courtesy, but
these men were too humble. The Royal dais was prepared at the west side
of the Queen's. 2 His honourable chair was placed in the eastern part
of the south veranda. A little apart from it on the east side were hung
misu, and two of the court ladies in attendance on the King came out
from behind that misu. The beautiful shape of their hair, tied with
bands, was like that of the beauties in Chinese pictures. Lady Saemon
held the King's sword. She wore a blue-green patternless karaginu and
shaded train with floating bands and belt of "floating thread" brocade
dyed in dull red. Her outer robe was trimmed with five folds and was
chrysanthemum-coloured. The glossy 3 silk was of crimson; her figure
and movement, when we caught a glimpse of it, was flower-like and
dignified. Lady [Page 97]  Ben-no-Naishi held the box of the King's
seals. Her uchigi was grape-coloured, her brocaded train and karaginu
were the same as the former lady. She is a very small and smile-giving
person and seemed a little shy and I was sorry for her. Her face and
clothes were in better taste than those of the other ladies. Her
hair-bands were blue-green. Her appearance suggested one of the ancient
dream-maidens descended from heaven. 

The officers of the King's Bodyguard managed things connected with the
state carriage [perhaps drawn by a bullock] in fine style. They were
elegantly dressed. The First Lieutenant-General took His Majesty's
sword and gave it to Lady Saemon. 

Looking over those who were inside the misu I saw that persons who were
permitted to wear honourable colours were in karaginu of blue or red,
painted trains, and uchigi which were as a rule brocade of old red and
old rose. Only the Right Bodyguard wore clothes of shrimp pink. The
beaten 1 stuffs were like the mingling of dark and light maple leaves
in autumn. The under garments were in deep and pale jasmine yellow or
in green and white. Some wore scarlet and green, and others dresses
trimmed with three folds. Among those who were not permitted to wear
figured silk the elderly persons wore blue, or dull red and old rose
five-fold-bordered uchigi. The colour of the sea painted on their
trains was tasteful and quiet. On their belts was a repeated design. 

The younger ladies wore five-fold-trimmed karaginu of chrysanthemum
colours according to their [Page 98]  taste. The first garment was
white and those who wore a blue dress covered it with a red one. Those
who wore old rose on the outside took more richly coloured garments
underneath. 1 Among those whose dress was in combination with white,
only those who made skilful combinations seemed well dressed. I saw
some fans exquisitely strange and original. We can compare their tastes
more easily in their everyday dress, but on such an occasion as this,
when they give their whole minds to the costumes, vying with each
other, they all seem like so many works of art. They look rather alike,
and it is difficult to distinguish ages, or to know whether hair is
thick or thin. Their faces and heads were hidden by fans, yet some
ladies seemed more dignified and others inferior. Ladies who seem
distinguished at such a time must be beautiful indeed. Five ladies who
had formerly served both the King and our Queen were assembled
here. They were, two ladies-in-waiting, two maids-of-honour, and one
cook. 2 

To serve the dinner Ladies-in-Waiting Chikuzen and Sakyo, their hair
tied with bands, came out near the square pillar where the court ladies
sat. They were like beautiful angels [Japanese word, tennin]. Sakyo
wore karaginu of white, and blue under white. Lady Chikuzen wore
five-fold-trimmed karaginu of chrys- [Page 99]  anthemum colours. The
ornament of their trains was dyed by rubbing. 1 Lady Tachibana of the
Third Rank prepared the dinner. She is an old lady and wore blue 2
karaginu, and yellow chrysanthemum uchigi woven in a "floating
thread" pattern. A sudaré was rolled up, but a post obscured the
view. The Lord Prime Minister, taking the August young Prince in his
arms went before the King. His Majesty took the child himself. The
Honourable Infant cried a little in a very young voice. Lady
Ben-no-Saisho stood holding the Prince's sword. The Prince was taken to
the Lord Prime Minister's wife, who set on the west side of the inner
door. After His Majesty had gone, Ben-no-Saisho came out and said to
me: "I was exposed to brightness [i.e. the radiance of the King's
presence]. I felt discomposed." Her blushing face was beautiful in
every feature, and set off her dress delightfully. 

When night came we had beautiful dances. The court nobles presented
themselves before the King [to dance]. The names of the dances
performed were: 

The Pleasures of Ten Thousand Ages.
The Pleasures of a Peaceful Reign.
The Happy Palace. 
When they danced the "Long-Pleasing 3 Son," the [Page 100]  closing
one, they went out singing and danced along the road beyond the garden
hills. 1 As they went farther away the sound of flute and drum mingled
with the sound of wind in the pine-wood towards which they were
going. The garden brook, cleansed very carefully, was refreshing to us
and the [sound of the] water rippling on the pond gave us a chilly
feeling. Lady Sakyo offered the Queen sympathy, not knowing that she
had doubled her undergarments, so people laughed secretly. Lady
Chikuzen talked of the late King Enyu, 2 who had visited her often. She
talked about the events of those days, and I felt that she was about to
utter things unfit for this happy occasion, so I did not answer her
saying I was too tired. We were sitting with a curtain between us. If
there had been some one to ask, "Alas, what things?" she would have
spilled the unfit words. 2 The dancing before the king had begun and it
was very delightful, when the voice of the young Prince was heard
crying beautifully. The Minister of the Right said flatteringly that
the August Child's voice was in accord with the music. The Commander of
the King's Left Bodyguard recited with others "The Pleasures of Ten
Thousand Years" and "The Pleasures of Ten Thousand Autumns." Our
honourable host, the Lord Prime Minister, said, "Ah! I held the
previous condescending visit as a great honour, but this is the
greatest." He wept in in- [Page 101]  toxication of joy. There's really
no need of my saying it, but he is so grateful to the King and so
conscious of his happiness it is lovely to see it. 


The Prime Minister withdrew and His Majesty retired from the
chamber. He summoned the Minister of the Right to order him to record
that the Queen's officials and Prime Minister's stewards were to be
advanced in rank. To-no-Ben presented to him all who were to be thus
honoured. The nobles of the Fujiwara clans 1 arrived together, but
there were only those immediately connected with the Prime Minister's
family, the other three families were not among them. Then came the
chief officers of the Right Body guard, the high officials of the Queen
Dowager, the officials of our Queen to whom additional duties were
assigned, and other members of the court who had been promoted and who
came to thank the King. His Majesty went in beside the Queen, but as
the night was far advanced it was not long before the Prime Minister
called the Royal carriage and the King returned to his own palace. 


The next day Royal messengers came here before the morning mist had
cleared up. I arose late and did not see them. Last evening was the
first time that His [Page 102]  Majesty the King had met the Queen
during these months. After the visit the duties of the August Prince's
attendants and ladies were made public. Some who had not heard about it
before were disappointed and jealous. The decorations of the Queen's
apartment, which had been neglected, were improved. Things became more
attractive in the Queen's presence. For years the Prime Minister had
felt anxious [as the Queen had had no child], but his hopes being
realized he and his wife devoted themselves to taking care of the
Queen. The August Child seems to have shed brightness around him. 


In the evening the moonlight was very beautiful. The Second Official of
the August young Prince came, perhaps thinking that his thanks might be
offered by a court lady. The bridge opposite the door was wet with
vapour from the bath. No one answered, so he went to the room of Lady
Miya-no-Naishi which is next the bridge of the eastern building. Lady
Saisho was in the inner room. The man, holding back the unlocked door,
asked again, "Is some one within?" But she did not come out. Just then
the Queen's First Officer appeared and called, "Is some one there?" She
felt it impossible not to reply, so made a faint answer. The new
official was in a gay humour and said reproachfully, "You did not
answer me, but you especially favour the Head Officer! It is natural
enough, but not kind; is there so much difference between the nobles in
this place? It is too much!" He sung "The August Happiness of the
Day." As the night ad- [Page 103]  vanced the moon became brighter; "It
would be better to take away the obstruction from before the
door," said he persuasively. I thought it awkward that a noble of the
Court should stand there below me like that, but I did not open the
door. If I were younger, I thought, my inexperience would be my excuse
were I to talk with him or open the door, but one cannot talk
thoughtlessly when one is young no longer, so I did not open the door
but held it with my hand. 


The first day of the Frost month was the fiftieth day after the
birth. The persons who were to present themselves came in full
dress. The sight before her presence was like a picture of a poet's
assembly. Many kicho were arranged along the east side of the Queen's
dais from the inner room to the veranda. The Royal dining-table was
placed towards the south front of the house. At the west side was
prepared the Queen Dowager's dinner. It was placed on a tray of aloe
wood. I don't know what kind of a stand it was on because I did not see
it. She wore a grape-coloured kimono trimmed with five folds and red
uchigi. Those serving the dinner were Lady Saisho and Lady Sanuki. The
maids-of-honour dressed their hair with saishi and bands. Lady Dainagon
served the August Prince's dinner at the east side­a little
dining-table, plate, stand for chopsticks, with a central decoration
representing a bit of seashore­all as small as playthings for dolls. At
the east end where the sudaré was a little rolled up, there were in
waiting such ladies as [Page 104]  Ben-no-Naishi, Lady Nakatsukasa,
Lady Koshosho; as I was inside I could not see in great detail. That
night Lady Sefu, the nurse, was permitted to wear a dress of honourable
colour. She seemed still girlish, as she took the August Prince in her
arms and gave him to the Lord Prime Minister who was within the
dais. He came out quietly and they were plainly seen in the flickering
light of the torches. It was very lovely. The August Prince was dressed
in red brocade with shaded skirt­exquisitely pretty. The Mochi 1 was
given to him by the Lord Prime Minister. The seats of the courtiers had
been prepared at the west side of the east building; there were two
ministers present. They came out onto the bridge and were very drunk
and boisterous. 


As the torches burnt low, the Major-General of the Fourth Rank was
called to light lanterns. Boxes and baskets of food, 2 the Prime
Minister's gifts, were borne in by the attendants and piled up on the
balcony near the railing. Some of the boxes were to be taken to the
King's kitchen, and as the next day was to be a day of abstinence for
religious devotion they were carried away at once. 


The Queen's First Officer came to the misu and asked if the court
nobles should be invited there. As 

[Facing Page]


ROYAL DAIS AND KICHO, SUDARÉ, ETC. 

[Page 105]  the answer was "yes," every one came led by the Prime
Minister, and approached the east door. Ladies stood in two or three
rows; the misu was rolled up by those who were nearest it, Lady
Dainagon, Lady Koshosho, and others. The Minister of the Right came
dancing wildly and made a hole in the kicho behind which ladies were
sitting. They laughed, saying, "He has long passed the age for
that." He did not notice, but made a great many unbecoming jokes,
taking away ladies' fans. The August Prince's First Officer took a saké
cup 1 and stepped out; he sung a song; although it was unaccompanied by
dancing it was very delightful. Farther towards the east, leaning
against a door-post, the General of the Right was standing, studying
the ladies' sleeves and the skirts of their garments showing below the
misu. He is different from other men. The ladies, thinking that after
all the intoxicated men were only trying to seem young and
irresistible, made light of their behavior and said, "It is nothing,
nobody else will behave so." Compared with such men the General is far
superior. He was afraid of the saké cup, and when it came to him passed
it by, singing the song which begins "One Thousand and Ten Thousand
Ages." The First Officer of the Light Bodyguard said, "I think Lady
Murasaki must be somewhere here!" I listened, thinking, "How can she be
here in a place where there is no [Page 106]  such graceful person as
Prince Genji?" 1 The Minister of the Right said, "Sanmi-no-Suké
[officer of the third rank], accept this cup!" When the officer came
out from below the Lord Keeper of the seal [an inferior position] the
drunken man wept. The King's Adviser, leaning in a corner, was flirting
with Lady Hyobu. The Prime Minister did not forbid even unmentionable
jokes. It was an awful night of carousel, so after the ceremony I
signalled to Lady Saisho and we hid ourselves, but there came noisily
the Prime Minister's sons and Lieutenant-General Saisho, so, although
we two had remained hidden behind the screen, even this was taken away
and we were captives. "Compose a poem each, and you shall be
excused," said the Lord Prime Minister. I was frightened and helpless,
and made haste to comply: 

How can I number the years of the Prince!
One thousand, nay, eight thousand, may he live, and more. 
"Well done!" said he, reciting it twice, and he answered immediately: 

O would I might live the life of a crane­ 
Then might I reckon the years of the Prince 
Up to one thousand! 
He was much intoxicated, but the poem had feeling, for it came from his
innermost desire. The child cherished in this way will have a very
bright future. Even such as I can imagine the thousand prosperous years
of His August Highness! He felt satisfied with his own poem and said,
"Has Your Majesty heard the poem? I have made a poem!" and then­"I am
[Page 107]  worthy to be your father and you are worthy to be my
daughter­Mother is smiling, she must think she is happy. She may be
thinking she has got a good husband! " said he in extreme
intoxication. As is usual with drunken persons all were listening. His
wife seemed to be embarrassed by this conversation and retired. "Mother
will be angry if I do not follow her," said he, and went through the
dais hurriedly, muttering, "Excuse me, Your Majesty, but a child is
adored because of its father!" and everybody laughed. 


The day for the Queen's return to the palace approaches and her ladies
have no tranquil hours because of continual ceremonies. Her Majesty had
had blank books made, so from early morning I was summoned to attend
her to arrange the paper and to write letters which were sent with the
books and the romances to be copied. I also spent days in compiling
these into books. "What fancy is this? Why do you do such things these
chilly days?" the Lord Prime Minister said, but he himself brought out
fine papers, brushes and ink, and even writing-boxes. These were given
to the ladies by the Queen's own hand. They were bashful, but excuses
were in vain, and they went into corners and composed and came back
blushing, saying, "I have done this," only to be given more brushes and
ink. I had brought my romances from home and hidden them in my own
room, but one day the Prime Minister entered it secretly to hunt about
and found them and gave them to the first lady-in-waiting. As the books
are not at all clearly [Page 108]  written, I am ashamed to think what
their opinion must be. 1 

The infant Prince begins to babble and crow. His Majesty is naturally
impatient to have him. The waterfowl have begun to come more and more
to the pond before the house. 


I longed for snow while we were staying there, but just then I had to
go home to my parents. Two days after retiring from the Court a great
snow came. The old familiar trees of my home reminded me of those
melancholy years when I used to gaze upon them musing when the colours
of flowers, the voices of birds, the skies of Spring and Autumn, moon
shadows, frost and snow, told me nothing but that time was revolving,
and that I was menaced with a dreary future. Before I went to Court I
tried to avoid sadness by writing to those who were in the same state
of mind, even to those with whom I was only slightly acquainted, and
associating with them I consoled my heart in various ways. Although an
unimportant person I had passed my life without feeling any sort of
contempt of myself until I went to Court­since then, alas! I have
experienced all the bitterness of it. Today I took out romances, but
they no longer interested me. I was ashamed to think what those
melancholy persons to whom I used to write had thought of me since I
went to Court, so I had no courage to write to them again. Those with
whom I am now intimate [Page 109]  would have to publish my letters
broadcast, so how can I write to them my inmost heart?­thus my letters
have inadvertently grown few. I had a feeling that association with
some of the younger ladies who used to visit me before I went to Court
could not continue. Some of them I had to refuse when they came, and in
my home all these trifles have made me feel more deeply that I have
gone into a world not intended for me. I write only to those from whom
I can never part, to whom my heart prompts me to speak. O worthless
heart, that feels love only for those with whom it daily associates! I
long for Lady Dainagon with whom I spent every night before the Queen,
when we told each other all our heart's secrets­is it also my worldly
heart that longs for a companion other than Buddha? 

Like two wild ducks 
Floating with unrestful slumber, 
Yet even those nights I would recall­ 
      Feathers wet and cold­ 
But colder tears! 
Lady Dainagon returned this answer: 

      Midnight sleep was broken
   But no friend to brush away the cold tears!
I envy the Oshidori 1 which has ever its mate by its side. 
Her handwriting is very elegant. She is a very true-hearted person. 

A lady wrote me, "The Queen has seen the snow, and she regrets deeply
that you are not here at Court." The Prime Minister's Lady wrote to me,
"When I [Page 110]  tried to stop your going away you said you would go
at once that you might come back soon. Was not that true?­for many days
have passed." She may not have been in earnest, yet as I received such
a letter I went back to the Court. 


It was on the seventeenth of the Frost month that the Queen went back
to the palace. The time had been fixed for eight o'clock in the
evening, but the night was far advanced. I could not see more than
thirty ladies who tied up their hair. To the east balcony of the
Queen's apartments came more than ten ladies-in-waiting from His
Majesty's Court [to escort the Queen]. Her Majesty's senji [woman who
repeats the Queen's words to outsiders] went in Her Majesty's coach
with her. The Lord Prime Minister's wife and Lady Sen, the nurse,
holding the August Infant in her arms, went in a coach adorned with
silk fringes. Lady Dainagon and Lady Saisho were in a gold-studded
coach. In the next one went Lady Koshosho and Lady Miya-no-Naishi. The
Lieutenant-General of His Majesty's stud was in the next one. I was to
go in that one. His manner expressed dissatisfaction with so mean a
companion and I was much discomposed. Lady Jiyu, Ben-no-Naishi, Lady
Saemon, the Prime Minister's first attendant, and Lady Shikibu went in
their proper order in their palanquins. As it was bright moonlight I
was greatly embarrassed, and in the palace I followed the
Lieutenant-General not knowing where I trod. If some one had been
looking at me from behind [Japanese expres- 

[Facing Page] 


A NOBLEMAN'S CARRIAGE

[Page 111]  sion signifying "gossiping about or criticizing"], I must
have been ashamed indeed. 


I passed that night in the third little room on the corridor of the
Kokiden. 1 Lady Koshosho came and we talked of the sadness of our
lives. We took off our kimonos and put on doubly wadded ones, and
making a fire in an incense-burner we were complaining of the cold when
the Chamberlain and the State Councillor and Lieutenant-General Kinnobu
came to inquire for us. I wished I might have been entirely forgotten
this evening. It annoyed more than it pleased us; nevertheless, as they
had come to make inquiries, I said: "To-morrow I will return the
compliment and go to inquire after you. To-night I am shivering with
cold." Saying these words we secretly stole away from that room. Some
were now preparing to go back to their homes; we thought them to be
some of the lower officials. I do not say this as comparing them with
myself. By the way, Lady Koshosho is very noble in character and
beautiful, but I notice she is thinking sadly of the World. 2 One
reason is her father's rather humble rank which makes good fortune
delay to come to her. 


This morning Her Majesty saw in detail last evening's presents from the
Prime Minister. The hair ornaments in a case were more lovely than
words can express. There were a pair of salvers. On one of them [Page
112]  were poem papers and bound blank books. On the other were the
poetical collections of the Kokinshu, Gosenshu, and Juishu. 1 Each was
bound in five volumes. The copyists of these volumes were the King's
Adviser and attendant of middle rank and Enkwan. 2 The covers were of
thin figured silk; the fastenings of braided silk of the same
material. They were fitted into a basket. There were also ancient and
modern poetical collections of various families, such as those of
Yoshinobu and Motosuké. The copies made by Enkwan 2 and Chikazumi 2
were kept for the Queen's private use. They were made in the new
fashion. 


On the twentieth day of the Frost month the dance of Gosetchi 3 was
performed. A costume was given to the young lady whom the King's
attendant and State Councillor offered for the dance. The
Lieutenant-General asked for a garland for his dancer, which was
given. At the same time a box of perfume ornamented with artificial
leaves and plum blossoms was given [Page 113]  her. As the arrangements
had been made a long time beforehand this year, there was great rivalry
among the dancers. Torches were lighted in close rows along the outer
doors of the eastern veranda so there was day-brightness, and it was
really awkward to walk there. I felt for the girls, but it was not they
only who were embarrassed. Young nobles looked at the girls face to
face, almost bringing the lights down in front of them. They tried to
draw a curtain before themselves, but in vain, and the nobles' eyes
were still on them. My heart throbs even at the memory of it. 


The helpers 1 of courtier Narito's daughter were dressed in brocaded
karaginu, which was distinctive and pleasing even at night. She was
overwhelmed by her dress and her movements were ungraceful, yet the
nobles paid her special attention. The King came to see the dance. The
Lord Prime Minister, too, crept in from the side entrance, so we felt
constraint. 

The helpers of Nakakyo's daughter were all of the same height. They
were graceful and charming, and people agreed that they were not
inferior to any ladies. 

The State Councillor and Lieutenant-General had all his maids as
helpers of his daughter. One of them was ungraceful, being fat and
countrified, so all were laughing at her. The daughter of To [State
Council- [Page 114]  lor] gave a fresh and distinct impression because
of her family. 1 She had ten helpers. 

The ladies who were proud of their good looks seemed more beautiful in
this artificial light. 

On the morning of the day of the Tiger 2 the courtiers
assembled. Although it is a common custom to have the dance, the
younger ones were especially curious to see the dancers. Was it because
they had acquired rude country manners during these months of absence
from the Court? There the dress dyed by rubbing the leaves of the
indigo plant was not to be seen. When night came the second official of
the Crown Prince was summoned and perfumes were bestowed upon
him. Quantities of it were heaped up in a large box. 


That night the dance was performed in the Seiryoden.3 The King was
present to see it. The Prime Minister's wife sent a messenger to the
Governor of Owari. 


As the August young Prince was to be present, rice was thrown to keep
off evil spirits, and people reviled them [the spirits] and called them
names. It gave us a queer feeling. I was weary and wanted to rest a
little, so I remained in our chamber thinking to present myself when it
should be necessary. Lady Kohyoé and Lady Kohyobu sat beside the
brazier. We were saying [Page 115]  that the hall was crowded and
nothing could be seen distinctly, when the Lord Prime Minister came
in. "Why do you stay here? Come with us!" so we went reluctantly. I
watched the dancers thinking how tired they must be, and what a heavy
task they had before them. The daughter of the Governor of Owari became
ill and retired. Human fate is like a dream, it seems! After the dance
His Majesty retired. 


Young noblemen talk of nothing these days but the rooms of those
dancers. 1 Even the borders of the curtains hanging over the sudaré
were varied according to the taste of the dancer. Their hair-dressing
and their style also varied extremely, so the young men talked about
that, and more improper things too. Even in ordinary years [when there
was no unusual festivity] the dancing girls' hearts are always filled
with anxiety, how much more so this year. While I was thinking about it
they came out in single file. My heart swelled with sympathy. It may be
they have no great patrons to depend on who could protect them. As they
are all chosen for their beauty all are attractive, and it would be
difficult to say which is superior to the other, although the man of
fashion may perhaps perceive differences. In this brilliant light they
may not even shade their faces with their fans. They are placed in
rivalry with each other in rank, in prudence, and in wit, and must
struggle each to excel the other, although at the same time they [Page
116]  feel shyness in the presence of the young men. Surrounded by the
young nobles, they are forced to hold their own among them worthily. I
feel sorry for them. 


Governor Tamba's daughter wore a darkish blue gown. The State
Councillor To's daughter wore red. The maids of the latter wore the
blue karaginu of a girl and were so beautiful that they made us women
jealous. One girl did not seem at all dignified. The daughter of the
State Councillor and Lieutenant-General was tall and had beautiful
hair. Her attendants wore deep-coloured clothes trimmed with five folds
and their outer garments were varied according to taste. The last girl
wore a plain grape-coloured one, and that simple dress was more
beautiful, as it showed taste in colour combination. 

The secretaries of the sixth rank went towards them to take away their
fans. They threw them down themselves. Though they were graceful they
did not seem like girls. If we were in their places it would seem like
a dream to us. I had never supposed I should mingle with these court
ladies! Yet the human heart is an invisible and dreadful being. If I
became accustomed to [court life] my bashfulness would be overcome and
I could easily stand face to face with men. As if in a vision my future
appeared to me, and such a state of things appeared to me
undesirable. My mind was greatly troubled and I could observe nothing. 


The apartment temporarily given to the dancer who was the daughter of
the King's Adviser and State [Page 117]  Councillor was just across the
way [in the building of another queen, see map of palace] on the
corridor opposite to that of our Queen. A part of the sudaré of that
room was in sight above the outer shutter, although we could hear
voices but faintly. The State Councillor and Lieutenant-General, who
knew about it all, said, "There are ladies called Sakyo and Uma who
once served that Queen over there." "It was Sakyo who sat in the
eastern part of the hall last night as a helper of a certain young lady
who danced," said Genshosho, who knew her. Some of our Queen's ladies
chanced to overhear these remarks. "How extraordinary! Yet she must
remember old times," said they; "how is it possible that a former
lady-in-waiting should return to the court as a maid? She may be
thinking it will never be known, but we will one day bring it to
light!" 

Our ladies may have been scheming for this when they chose among the
multitude of fans kept by the Queen those representing the Island of
Horai1­did she feel it, I wonder? 


Ground-pine [Lycopodium] was made into a wreath and put into a
box-cover [probably of a writing-box, in those days large and elegantly
lacquered]. A comb and face-powder were put in also, for the young
courtiers had said, "that lady, who is rather advanced in years, wears
a curved comb suitable for a young [Page 118]  lady." So the comb which
was put into the box was curved too much in the vulgar new fashion with
perfume balls clumsily covered with paper. A poem was added to it
written by Lady Saifu: 

Among the many ladies that night of the dance
The belle was the one who wore the lycopodium. 
The Queen said: "If you are going to send at all, send something
clever, here are many fans for it." But some ladies replied: "That will
attract too much attention. It is too unusual. If you send this
publicly you will not succeed in puzzling her; perhaps we would better
send it anonymously." Therefore a lady who was an entire stranger to
her was chosen. She went, and, speaking loudly, said: "Here is a letter
from Lady Chunagon. It is sent by her Queen to Lady Sakyo." I thought
it would be awkward if the messenger were caught by them, but she ran
away as soon as she had put down the things. She reported that she
heard some one saying, "Whence do you come?" There is no doubt she
really thought it a gift from our Queen. 


Days passed without any interesting events. After that evening of
dancing the Court became absolutely dull. The preparatory music on the
eve of the Omi ceremony 1 was very fine. The young courtiers were still
filled with thoughts of the dancers. After the Queen's return to the
palace, the little sons of another wife of the Prime Minister were
permitted to come in [Page 119]  to play with the
ladies-in-waiting. They came to us without end, which was a great
bother. I did not show myself to them, taking advantage of my advanced
age. They were not thinking of the dancers, but were playing by the
side of Ladies Yasurai and Kohyoé, joking and chattering like little
birds. 


At the occasional festival of the Kamo shrine the
Vice-Lieutenant-General [first son of the Prime Minister] was made the
King's substitute. It was a day of fasting also, so the Lord Prime
Minister had passed the night at the palace. The nobles and dancers
passed the night of the festival in making a great noise with much
merriment in the corridors. Next morning an attendant of the
Chamberlain brought something to an attendant of the Lord Prime
Minister. It was the box-cover of the previous night. 1 There was in it
a silver case for romances, besides a mirror, a comb of aloe wood, and
a silver kogai. The comb seemed to be given to adorn the hair of the
messenger at the festival. Something was written on the box-cover in
reed style in raised characters. It was the answer to the poem of the
lycopodium. Two characters were omitted and it was difficult to
read. She seemed to have misunderstood. The Chamberlain thought it
really was a gift to her from our Queen, so [Page 120]  the return was
made thus openly. It was but a foolish joke and I felt sorry for her. 


The Prime Minister's wife came to court to see the festival. His son,
adorning his head with artificial wisteria, appeared quite a man, noble
and dignified. The Lady Kura [his nurse], not taking any notice of the
dancers, wept for joy watching her young lord. As it was still the day
of fasting, they came back from the shrine at two in the morning, and
the sacred dance was performed listlessly, as the important persons
were absent. Kanetoki [a dancer] who had been very handsome last year,
was much fallen off. Though a stranger to him I felt regret, being
reminded of the fleeting life of us all 


[Here an interval occurs.] 

On the twentieth of the Finishing month I went again to Court. It was
the anniversary of the day on which I had first come. I remembered my
former career as a wanderer on dream paths, and I loathed myself for
having become so familiar with court life. The night was far advanced
and as the Queen was fasting, we did not present ourselves before
her. I felt lonely and was lying down. The maids-of-honour around me
said: "The hours here are very different from those at home. There all
would be sleeping by this time, but here our dreams are broken by the
sound of shoes along the corridor." Hearing them girlishly talking I
murmured to myself: 

My life and the year are closing together.
At the sound of the wind dreary is my heart. 
[Page 121]  
On that moon-hidden night [last night of the year] the driving off of
evil spirits was soon finished. We dyed our teeth [black], and after
finishing decorating our faces we sat at ease. Ben-no-Naishi came, and
after talking she went to sleep. The Queen's seamstress sat in the
doorway watching the maid Ateki sewing. Just then we heard an unusual
noise from the direction of Her Majesty's apartment. I tried to wake up
Ben-no-Naishi, but she was heavy with sleep. Some one was heard crying
wildly. I was frightened and could not think what to do. Was it a
fire? But no, it was not that. I pushed the seamstress forward, saying,
"Go there! over there! Oh, dear!!" Then, "Her Majesty is in her own
room, we must by all means get to her!" I shook Ben-no-Naishi roughly
to awaken her and we three ran trembling­flying rather than walking. We
saw two naked persons. They were Lady Yugei and Lady Kohyobé. It seemed
that they had been robbed of their clothes, and I felt more distressed
than before. The kitchen servants had all gone out; even the Queen's
guards had retired after devil driving. We clapped our hands, but no
one came. Some went to call the women attendants, while I, forgetting
my shyness, said, "Call Hyobu-no-Jo, the secretary." He was sought for,
but had left the palace. I felt irritated indeed, but at last an
assistant to the Master of Ceremonies came who poured oil into several
lamps. We found many who had fainted. At the news a messenger arrived
from the King, but we were too frightened to receive him properly. He
took out dresses from the royal wardrobe to give them. The [Page 122]
new dresses for New Year's Day were not stolen, so these ladies took
their misfortune lightly­but unforgettably dreadful is a nude form. I
can never call it laughable. It was too dreadful to speak of, but we
could not help talking. 


The New Year's Day [1008] was inauspicious. The rice-cake [mochi 1 ]
ceremony was deferred. However, on the third day, the August Crown
Prince went up to the King and the rice-cake festival was given for
him. His attendant was Lady Dainagon. The dress of the ladies on the
first day was karaginu of purple and old rose colour, red kimono and
shaded train; on the second day, red and purple brocade, deep violet
glossy silk, green karaginu, train dyed by rubbing flowers. On the
third day we wore white and rose-coloured brocaded garments, trimmed
with many folds. The karaginu was of dull red and old rose
brocade. When we wear deep violet-coloured shining silk the inner robe
is of crimson; when we wear crimson outside the inner dress is usually
of deep violet. The pale and deep colour of spring leaf buds, dull red,
golden yellow, and light and dark crimsons­dresses of these ordinary
colours were worn trimmed with six folds in very beautiful
combinations. 2 [Page 123]  

Lady Saisho held the August Prince's honourable sword. The Lord Prime
Minister took the August Prince in his arms and they presented
themselves before the King. Lady Saisho's dress was a garment trimmed
with three and five folds, and figured of the same colour trimmed with
seven folds. The uchigi was adorned with a pattern of oak-leaves
beautifully embroidered. She wore a karaginu and train trimmed with
three folds. Her unlined inner kimono was woven in a pattern. Her
costume was in the Chinese style. Her hair was ornamented more
elaborately than usual. Her style of dress and manner showed great
knowledge of the world. She is rather tall and has a well-rounded
figure. Her face is very small and exquisitely tinted. 


[The following eleven paragraphs are portraits of prominent ladies of
the court.] 

LADY DAINAGON is very small and refined, white, beautiful, and round,
though in demeanour very lofty. Her hair is three inches longer than
her height. She uses exquisitely carved hairpins. Her face is lovely,
her manners delicate and charming. 

LADY SENJI is also a little person, and haughty. Her hair is fine and
glossy and one foot longer than the ordinary. She puts us to shame, her
carriage is so noble. When she walks before us we feel so much in the
shade that we are uncomfortable. Her mind and speech make us feel that
a really noble person ought to be like her. [Page 124]  

­If I go on describing ladies' manners I shall be called an old gossip,
so I must refrain from talking about those around me. I will be silent
about the questionable and imperfect. 

LADY KOSHOSHO, all noble and charming. She is like a weeping-willow
tree at budding-time. Her style is very elegant and we all envy her her
manners. She is so shy and retiring that she seems to hide her heart
even from herself. She is of childlike purity even to a painful
degree­should there be a low-minded person who would treat her ill or
slander her, her spirit would be overwhelmed and she would die. Such
delicacy and helplessness make us anxious about her. 

LADY MIYA-NO-NAISHI, also a beauty of good height. Her appearance as
she sits is very dignified. She is fashionable. Although no single
feature is especially beautiful she has altogether an air of youth and
beauty. Her face is [literal translation] high in the middle and she
excels others in the fairness of her skin. Her hair-ornaments, her
forehead, oh, beautiful! produce an effect of refinement and elegance
She is very frank and unaffected in manner, and never the least bit
awkward about anything. She is naturalness itself. Her character may be
an example for us. She never tries consciously to attract, and she has
no vanity. 

LADY SHIKIBU is her younger sister. She is too plump, and her
complexion is a fragrant white. She [Page 125]  has a bright small face
and beautiful hair, although it is not long. She presents herself
before the Queen with false hair. Her plump appearance, oh,
smile-giving! Her eyes and forehead are lovely indeed; her smile is
full of sweetness. 

Among the younger ladies I think KODAYU and GENSHIKIBU are
beautiful. The former is a little person quite modern in type. Her
pretty hair is abundant at the roots, but gets too thin at the end,
which is one foot longer than she is. Her face is full of wit. People
will think her very pretty, and indeed there is no feature one would
wish to improve. The latter is tall and rather superior. Her features
are fine; she is smile-giving and lovable. She is very refined and
seems to be a favourite daughter of some person of dignity. 

LADY KOHYOÉ-NO-JO is also refined. These ladies cannot be looked down
upon by court nobles. With every one some fault is to be found, but
only those who are ever mindful to conceal it even when alone, can
completely succeed. 

LADY ATTENDANT MYAKI is a very pretty person. Her hair is scarcely
longer than her uchigi, the ends are beautifully cut. Her face was
agreeable also when I last saw it. 

There is also LADY GOSETCHI-NO-BEN. 1 She is the adopted daughter of
Middle Adviser Hei. Her face is [Page 126]  like a picture. She has a
broad forehead and eyelids drooping at the corners. Her features are
not remarkable at any point, but her complexion is white, her hands and
arms are pretty. When I saw her in the spring for the first time her
hair, which was profusely abundant, was one foot longer than herself,
but it suddenly became thinner at the ends, and now it is only a little
longer than she is. 

A LADY KOMA had very long hair, an agreeable lady in those days; now
she has become like the bridge of a lute which has been immovably
fastened with glue. She has gone home. 

So much for their appearance and now for their dispositions. Here few
can be selected, though each has some good points and few are entirely
bad. It is very difficult to possess such qualities as prudence, wit,
charm, right-mindedness, all at once. As to many ladies, the question
is whether they excel most in charms of mind or person. It is hard to
decide! Wicked, indeed, to write so much of others! 

There is LADY CHUJO who waits upon the Princess dedicated to the
service of the Kamo shrine. I had heard of her and secretly managed to
see her letters addressed to other persons. They were very beautifully
written but with such an exalted opinion of herself; in the whole world
she is the person of profoundest knowledge! None to compare with her,
it seems she is thinking. On reading them my heart beat faster, I was
furiously indignant for every one here [Page 127]  [the ladies of her
own Queen's Court], although it may be it is wrong to feel so. "Be it
in composition or poetry who can judge save our Princess-Abbess, who
will have bright futures but the ladies attending our Princess?" !! It
may be reasonable, yet I have never seen, compared to ours, any good
poems by the lady attendants of that Princess-Abbess. They seem to be
living an idle poetic life, but if they were to compete with us, it is
not necessarily certain they would be superior, though no one knows
them well. On a beautiful moonlight night or morning, at the time of
flowers or of cuckoo, courtiers might visit their
residence. Other-worldly and sacred it is, and made to the taste of
their Princess. There they remain undisturbed, admiring her. On the
other hand, with us many things occur. The Queen has to go up to His
Majesty's apartment, the Lord Prime Minister comes, and we have to keep
watch at night. But there is nothing of all this in that world all
their own where they may indulge in elegance and avoid blunders. If I
could live there like an old piece of buried wood thrown in among them,
I might succeed in freeing myself from the reproach of
shallowness­would that I might indulge in elegance there, relaxing
myself! Forward young ladies there can devote themselves to dress,
making themselves inferior to none and pleasing to courtiers. On the
other hand, in our Queen's Court we rather neglect to adorn ourselves,
for our Queen has no rivals now. Moreover, she thinks unfavourably of
frivolous women, so those who wish to serve her and remain in favour
keep [Page 128]  from association with men. Of course everywhere there
are light-hearted, unashamed, thoughtless women, and men who visit our
court to find them say we are awkward and unversed in social usage. Our
ladies of the higher ranks are, indeed, much too reserved and
haughty; it is not in this way that they can bring honour to our
Queen. It is painful to see them. The attendants of the Princess-Abbess
seem to have been alluding to these ladies, but both defects and merits
are found in every one, so we may not be inferior to them after
all. Even our young ladies nowadays have heard of self-respect. It
would be embarrassing if they were too frivolous, but one would not
wish them to be heartless either. 

Our Queen of perfect mind, enviably lovely, is reserved and never
obtrusive, for she believes that few who are forward can avoid
blunders. In fact, imperfect wit is worse than reserve. Our Queen when
she was very young was much annoyed to hear persons of shallow culture
saying vulgar, narrow things with conceit, so she favoured ladies who
made no mistakes and childlike persons pleased her very well. This is
why our ladies have become so retiring. As Her Majesty grows older, she
begins to see the world as it is, the bad and good qualities of the
human heart. Reserve or boldness­she knows neither is good. The court
nobles rather look down on us­"Nothing interesting here!" they seem to
say. The Queen knows this, but she knows we cannot please every [Page
129]  body. If we stumble, hideous things may happen. Yet we must not
be faint-hearted and bashful either, so Her Majesty says, but our old
habits are not so easily shaken off, and all the young nobles of the
present day are, on their side, only indulgent pleasure-seekers. 

The ladies around the Abbess, who indulge in aesthetic pursuits, gazing
at the moon and admiring flowers, may talk only of these things to the
nobles, boastfully and intentionally, and the nobles might say that it
is difficult to find ladies with whom they can chatter light-heartedly
morning or evening, or discuss interesting topics
occasionally; although, as I have n't heard them say it, I don't know
really what they think. In general conversation it is awkward to say
profound things. It is far better to speak with simplicity, and the
nobles seem to think so. The difficulty is to understand the occasion
and adapt one's self to it. 

When the First Official of Her Majesty comes to report to her, the
delicate, shy ladies-in-waiting cannot meet him on common ground, or
converse fluently, not because they are deficient in words or thoughts,
but because of their extreme timidity. They fear their faults may be
noticed so they cannot decide what to say. Others [Abbess ladies] may
not be so. Even women of high birth must follow the general custom when
they become ladies-in-waiting at the Court, but many behave as if they
were still daughters at home. [Page 130]  

The Great Adviser 1 is displeased to be received by ladies of low rank,
so when he comes to the Queen's court to make some report and suitable
ladies to receive him are not available, he goes away without seeing
Her Majesty. Other court nobles, who often come to make reports, have
each a favourite lady, and when that one is away they are displeased,
and go away saying to other people, that the Queen's ladies are quite
unsatisfactory. There may be some reason in it, yet it is quite
unreasonable for the Abbess's ladies to say that we are unworthy to be
seen or heard. It is easy to criticize, and difficult to realize our
own ideals. These ladies, however, do not know that, and being full of
conceit, they treat others with disdain, thus revealing their own
limitations. Oh, how I wanted to show the letters to the Queen, but
they had been stolen by the lady who secretly showed them to me, and
they were soon taken back. I coveted those letters! 

LADY IZUMI SHIKIBU 2 corresponds charmingly, but her behaviour is
improper indeed. She writes with grace and ease and with a flashing
wit. There is fragrance even in her smallest words. Her poems are
attractive, but they are only improvisations which drop from her mouth
spontaneously. Every one of them has some interesting point, and she is
acquainted with ancient literature also, but she is not [Page 131]
like a true artist who is filled with the genuine spirit of poetry. Yet
I think even she cannot presume to pass judgment on the poems of
others. 

The wife of the Governor of Tamba Province is called by the Queen and
Prime Minister MASA HIRA EMON. 1 Though she is not of noble birth, her
poems are very satisfying. She does not compose and scatter them about
on every occasion, but so far as we know them, even her miscellaneous
poems shame us. Those who compose poems whose loins are all but broken,
yet who are infinitely self-exalted and vain, deserve our contempt and
pity. 

LADY SEISHONAGON. 2 A very proud person. She values herself highly, and
scatters her Chinese writings all about. Yet should we study her
closely, we should find that she is still imperfect. She tries to be
exceptional, but naturally persons of that sort give offence. She is
piling up trouble for her future. One who is too richly gifted, who
indulges too much in emotion, even when she ought to be reserved, and
cannot turn aside from anything she is interested in, [Page 132]  in
spite of herself will lose self-control. How can such a vain and
reckless person end her days happily! 


[Here there is a sudden change from the Court to her own home.] 

Having no excellence within myself, I have passed my days without
making any special impression on any one. Especially the fact that I
have no man who will look out for my future makes me comfortless. I do
not wish to bury myself in dreariness. Is it because of my worldly mind
that I feel lonely? On moonlight nights in autumn, when I am hopelessly
sad, I often go out on the balcony and gaze dreamily at the moon. It
makes me think of days gone by. People say that it is dangerous to look
at the moon 1 in solitude, but something impels me, and sitting a
little withdrawn I muse there. In the wind-cooled evening I play on the
koto, 2 though others may not care to hear it. I fear that my playing
betrays the sorrow which becomes more intense, and I become disgusted
with myself­so foolish and miserable am I. 

My room is ugly, blackened by smoke. I play on a thirteen or
six-stringed koto, but I neglect to take away the bridges even in rainy
weather, and I lean it up against the wall between the cabinet and the
[Page 133]  door jamb. On either side of the koto stands a lute
[Japanese biwa]. A pair of big bookcases have in them all the books
they can hold. In one of them are placed old poems and romances. They
are the homes of worms which come frightening us when we turn the
pages, so none ever wish to read them. [Perhaps her own writings, she
speaks so slightingly of them.] As to the other cabinet, since the
person 1 who placed his own books [there] no hand has touched it. When
I am bored to death I take out one or two of them; then my maids gather
around me and say: "Your life will not be favoured with old age if you
do such a thing! Why do you read Chinese? Formerly even the reading of
sutras was not encouraged for women." They rebuke me in the [shade
i.e. behind my back]. I have heard of it and have wished to say, "It is
far from certain that he who does no forbidden thing enjoys a long
life," but it would be a lack of reserve to say it [to the maids]. Our
deeds vary with our age and deeds vary with the individual. Some are
proud [to read books], others look over old cast-away writings because
they are bored with having nothing to do. It would not be becoming for
such a one to chatter away about religious thoughts, noisily shaking a
rosary. I feel this, and before my women keep myself from doing what
otherwise I could do easily. But after all, when I was among the ladies
of the Court I did not say what I wanted to say either, for it is
useless to talk with those who do not understand [Page 134]  one and
troublesome to talk with those who criticize from a feeling of
superiority. Especially one-sided persons are troublesome. Few are
accomplished in many arts and most cling narrowly to their own opinion. 


Pretty and coy, shrinking from sight, unsociable, proud, fond of
romance, vain and poetic, looking down upon others with a jealous
eye­such is the opinion of those who do not know me, but after seeing
me they say, "You are wonderfully gentle to meet with; I cannot
identify you with that imagined one." 

I see that I have been slighted, hated, and looked down upon as an old
gossip, and I must bear it, for it is my destiny to be solitary. The
Queen said once, "You were ever mindful not to show your soul, but I
have become more intimate with you than others." I hope that I may not
be looked at obliquely even by those who are ill-natured, affected, and
unsociable. As a rule one is easy at the back [i.e. not afraid of
gossip] who is modest, gentle, and of tranquil disposition. Even a
coquettish and frivolous person is not rebuked if she is good-natured
and of a disposition not embarrassing to others. A person who is
self-exalted and eccentric with scornful mouth and demeanor can be
unmistakably perceived, and one can be on one's guard; by observing
closely one may discover faults of speech and behaviour. Those whose
words and deeds are not in harmony, or who are always trying to outdo
one another, attract [Page 135]  notice. One seldom wishes to criticize
those who have defects, but are good-natured. One cannot but sympathize
with them. Those who habitually do evil with intention deserve to be
freely talked about and laughed at even though sometimes they do it
without intention. We ought to love even those who hate us, but it is
very difficult to do it. Even the Buddha of Profound Mercy does not say
that the sins against Buddha, the laws of religion, and priests, are
slight. Moreover, in this muddy world it is best to let alone the
persons who hate us. If we compare one who tries to excel in hatred
saying extraordinary words and watching [their effect] ill-humouredly
face to face, with one who coldly hides her heart with a tranquil
manner, we can see which is superior. 


There is a lady, Saémon-no-Naishi, who unreasonably cherished hatred of
me. I was not at first aware of it, but later heard of much criticism
of me in my absence. Once the King was listening to a reading of my
Genji-monogatari, and said, "She is gifted, she must have read the
Chronicle of Japan." This lady heard of it, and unreflectingly spread
abroad among the courtiers the idea that I am very proud of my
learning, giving me the name of "The Japanese Chronicle lady"­it is
laughable, indeed! I am reserved even before the maids of my own
house; how then should I show my learning in Court? When my elder
brother Shikibu-no-Jo was a boy he was taught to read "Chinese
Historical Records." 1 I listened, [Page 136]  sitting beside him, and
learned wonderfully fast, though he was sometimes slow and
forgot. Father, who was devoted to study, regretted that I had not been
a son, but I heard people saying that it is not beautiful even for a
man to be proud of his learning, and after that I did not write so much
as the figure one in Chinese. I grew clumsy with my [writing]
brush. For a long time I did not care for the books I had already
read. Thus I was ashamed to think how others would hate me on hearing
what Lady Saémon said, and I assumed an air of not being able to read
the characters written on the Royal screen. But the Queen made me read
[to her] the poetical works of Li T'ai Po, and as she wished to learn
them I have been teaching her since the Summer of two years ago the
second and third volumes of that collection very secretly when none
were present. Her Majesty and I tried to conceal it, but His Majesty
the King and the Lord Prime Minister finding it out, the latter
presented to the Queen many poetical books which he had had copied. I
think that bitter Saémon does not know it yet. If she did, how she
would criticize me! 


Everything in this world is burdensome. Now I shall not be afraid
whatever happens. Whatever others may say of me I will recite sutras
kneeling before Amitabha Buddha. 1 When my mind has become completely
free from the burden of the world, nothing will weaken my determination
to become a [Page 137]  saint. Though I set myself devotedly against
worldly passions, it seems that there extends before me a limbo of dull
wanderings before I can mount the cloud. 1 I must be there now. I am
now of a fit age for the religious life. It is common to suppose that
men read sutras when they are old, yet really they are not read, for
minds grow more and more relax with age. I may be interpreted as one
who imitates persons of profound thought, but I will devote myself to
the religious life. The person of deep-rooted sin cannot succeed even
in such a hope [as that]. There happens many a circumstance which makes
me think of the [probable] wickedness of my pre-natal life and
everything makes me sad. 


[There seems to be an abrupt transition here and the following
paragraph seems to be part of a letter, perhaps sent with the diary or
other writing.] 

I wish I could make known everything to you, good and bad, things of
the world, and those relating to my life­all that I could not write in
my letters. You could not expect such writing as this from your
friend? You feel weary of life; please look into my heart, also
weary. Please write to me­even a little­whatever comes into your
mind. It would be very unfortunate if my writings were scattered about
and made known to others. I have written many things of this sort, but
recently I have torn up all my old [Page 138]  writings, burying some,
and making dolls' houses of the rest. Since that time I have received
no letters and am determined to write no more on fresh paper so thrifty
have I become! I think I am not in the wrong. After reading, please
return quickly. As I could not revise all there may be some
defects; read­overlooking them. 

My mind has been wholly occupied with the things and persons of our
world, and as I close this writing I reflect on how deeply rooted was
my interest in them, but it was only accident that closed my
descriptions of others. 


[Here an interval during which she returns to Court.] 

On the eleventh of the First month, 1009, in the early morning they
went to the temple. The Lord Prime Minister's wife accompanied the
Queen, others went by boat. I was belated and went at night There was
preaching. People made confession according to the custom of the
mountain temple. 1 Many pictures of pagodas were painted, and they
amused themselves. Most of the nobles had retired and there were few
persons left when the midnight preaching began. The preachers and
interpreters of the sutras were twenty in number.... [Here is a
sentence whose meaning is lost.] They all preached in different ways
about the merit of the Queen's presence; there were many things laughed
at. After the preaching the courtiers went boating; they all rowed and
en- [Page 139]  joyed themselves. At the eastern corner of the temple a
bridge had been built opposite the door opening towards the
North. There the High Official of the Crown Prince was leaning against
the railing. The Lord Prime Minister came for a little while and talked
with Lady Saisho, but as we were in the Queen's presence we could not
be at our ease. It was pretty both within and without the temple. The
pale moon appeared, and young nobles sang songs of the new fashion. A
song related that those who had gone into the boat were young and
pretty. The old Secretary of the Treasury was among them. He was
ashamed with reason to sing with the others, and stood there rather
embarrassed. The back view of him was comical and those within the misu
[i.e. the ladies] secretly laughed. Some one said, "He in the boat is
regretting old age." The High Official on the bridge heard it and sang,
"The ancient seekers for eternal life­the tradition is full of lies." 1
It sounded very latest fashion, indeed. Some sang "The
Duckweed" accompanied by the flute. Even the morning wind gave us
unusual impressions because of the place. 


In the Queen's presence was placed Genji-monogatari. Once the Lord
Prime Minister saw it and after many playful words wrote to me on a
[poem] paper attached to a plum branch. 

[The following poem depends for its point on the play upon a word with
two meanings.] [Page 140]  


                      Being notorious for {  love 
sourness  
I think none pass by without breaking a branch!  

[Her answer] 

No one in passing has ever broken the plum tree
Who then can know if it be sour? 
Oh, regrettable! to be spoken of in such a way! One night I slept in a
room near the corridor. Some one came knocking at the door. I was
afraid and passed the night without making a sound. The next morning
the following poem was sent me [from the Prime Minister]: 

All the night through, knocking louder than a water-rail,
I stood in vain at the door of hinoki wood 
      weary and lamenting. 
I wrote back: 

  A cause of deep regret, indeed,
Had the door opened at the knocking of the water-rail! 

[Here a space of nearly one year elapses.] 

Third day of First month [1010]. The August Princes have presented
themselves before the King for three days 1 to receive gifts of
mochi. Ladies of high rank accompanied them. Saémon-no-Kami held the
Prince, and the mochi was brought to His Majesty by the Lord Prime
Minister. The King, facing towards the east door, gave it to the August
Princes. 2 It was a beautiful sight to see the young Princes com- [Page
141]  ing and returning through the corridor. The Queen Dowager did not
present herself. On the first day Lady Saisho served at table; her
colour combination was cunningly executed. Ladies Takumi and Hyogo
officiated as the Queen's secretaries. The ladies who tied their hair
were particularly attractive. The lady who was entrusted with the
preparation of toso 1 was very vain of her skill and behaved as if she
were a doctor of medicine. Ointment was distributed as usual. 


The Prime Minister took the younger Prince in his arms and the King
embraced him lovingly, saying, "Long life and health" as usual. The
Lord Prime Minister replied, "I will uphold the younger Prince in my
arms"; but at that His Augustness the Crown Prince became jealous and
begged [to be taken up too], saying, "Ah! Ah!" The Prime Minister was
much pleased, and the General of the Right Bodyguard and others were
amused by it. 


The Lord Prime Minister had an audience with the King and they came out
together to find amusement. The Minister was much
intoxicated. "Troublesome!" I thought, and hid myself away, but I was
found. "You are summoned by the father of the Queen, yet you retire so
early! Suspicious person!" said he. "Now, instead of the Queen's father
it is you who must compose a poem! It is quite an ordinary occasion, so
don't hesitate!" He urged, but it [Page 142]  seemed to me very awkward
to make one only to have it laughed at. As he was very much in liquor,
his face was flushed and flamed out in the torchlight. He said, "The
Queen had lived for years alone and solitary. I had seen it with
anxiety. It is cheering to behold troublesome children on either side
of her." And he went to look at the Princes, who had been put to bed,
taking off the bedclothes. He was singing: 

"If there be no little pines in the field
How shall I find the symbol of 1000 ages?" 
People thought it more suitable that he should sing this old song than
make a new one. The next evening the sky was hazy; as the different
parts of the palace are built compactly in close rows I could only
catch a slight glimpse of it from the veranda. I admired his recitation
of last evening with the nurse Madam Nakadaka. This lady is of deep
thought and learning. 


I went home for a while. For the fifty days' ceremony of the second
Prince, which was the fifteenth day of the Sociable Month, I returned
in the early morning to the palace. Lady Koshosho returned in
embarrassing broad daylight. We two live together; our rooms adjoin and
we throw them together, each occupying the whole when the other is
absent. When we are there together we put kicho between them. The Lord
Prime Minister says we must be gossiping about other people. Some may
be uneasy to hear that, but as there are no unfriendly strangers here
we are not anxious about it. [Page 143]  

I went to the Queen's audience. My friend wore brocaded uchigi of old
rose and white, a red karaginu and figured train. My dress was of red
and purple and light green. My karaginu was green and white. The rubbed
design on the train was in the very latest fashion, and it would
perhaps have been better if a younger lady had worn it. There were
seventeen ladies of His Majesty the King's court who presented
themselves before the Queen. Lady Tachibana of the third rank served
the royal table. Ladies Kodayu and Shikibu on the balcony. The serving
of the young August Prince's dinner was entrusted to Lady
Koshosho. Their Majesties sat within the dais [one for each]. The
morning sun shone in and I felt too much brilliancy in their
presence. The King wore a robe with narrow sleeves. The Queen was
dressed in red as usual. Her inner kimonos were purple and red with
pale and dark green and two shades of yellow. His Majesty's outer dress
was grape-coloured 1 brocade, and his inner garment white and green­all
rare and modern both in design and colour. 

It seemed to be too dazzling in their presence, so I softly slid away
into an inner room. The nurse, Madam Nakadaka, holding the young Prince
in her arms, came out towards the south between the can- [Page 144]
opied King and Queen. She is short in stature, but of dignified
demeanour. She was perfectly tranquil and grave and a good example for
the young Prince [then not two months old!]. She wore grape-coloured
uchigi and patternless karaginu of white and old rose. That day all did
their utmost to adorn themselves. One had a little fault in the colour
combination at the wrist opening. When she went before the Royal
presence to fetch something, the nobles and high officials noticed
it. Afterwards, Lady Saisho regretted it deeply. It was not so
bad; only one colour was a little too pale. Lady Kotaiyu wore a crimson
unlined dress and over it an uchigi of deep and pale plum colour
bordered with folds. Her karaginu was white and old rose. Lady Gen
Shikibu appears to have been wearing a red and purple figured
silk. Some said it was unsuitable because it was not brocade. That
judgment is too conventional. There may be criticism where want of
taste is too apparent, but it were better to criticize manners. Dress
is rather unimportant in comparison. 

The ceremony of giving mochi to the Prince is ended and the table is
taken away. The misu of the anteroom was rolled up, and we saw ladies
sitting crowded at the west side of the dais. There were Lady Tachibana
of the third rank, and Naishi Nosuké, the younger attendant of the
August Princes sitting in the doorway. In the east anteroom near the
shioji 1 there were ladies of high rank. I went to seek Lady 

[Facing Page] 


SCREENED DAIS PREPARED FOR ROYALTY
From a print in an old book

[Page 145]  Dainagon and Lady Koshosho, who were sitting east of the
dais. His August Majesty sat on the dais with his dining-table before
him. The ornaments of it were exquisitely beautiful. On the south
balcony there sat the Minister of the Right and Left and the
Chamberlain, the first officials of the Crown Prince and of the Queen
and the Great Adviser Shijo, facing towards the North, the West being
the more honourable seat. There were no officials of low
rank. Afterwards they begun to amuse themselves. Courtiers sat on the
southeast corridor of the side building. The four lower officials took
their usual places [on the steps below Royalty] to perform some
music. They were Kagemasa, Korekazé, Yukiyoshi, Tonomasa. Prom the
upper seat the Great Adviser Shijo conducted the music. To no Ben
played the lute, Tsunetaka played the harp [koto]. The
Lieutenant-General of the Left Bodyguard and State Councillor played
the flute. Some outsiders joined in the music. One made a mistake in
the notes and was hissed. The Minister of the Right praised the
six-stringed koto. He became too merry, and made a great mistake, which
sent a chill even to the onlookers. 

The Prime Minister's gift was flutes put into two boxes.

[Page 77] between the translators as to whether this was done with the
intention of deceiving the evil spirits into attacking the wrong person
(by introducing into her neighbourhood other women surrounded with
screens and attendants) or by transmitting the supposed evil spirits
out of the Queen into her ladies by a sort of mesmerization.

intended to show through and modify the colour of the other. They were
fastened in front by a belt like the present-day kimono, and over them
was hung at the back the long and elaborate train of heavy white silk
on which the last word of elegance in embroidery or painting was
placed. In the presence of Royalty the ladies knelt in rows one behind
the other, and doubtless these trains made a great display spread out
before those sitting behind. (See frontispiece.)

1 These garments were evidently made of very thin material, colours
underneath being intended to modify the outer ones, hence the art of
dressing became very subtle. 

2 Doubtless this office was highly important and held in honour. In
those days poison and inferior foods were to be guarded
against. Throughout the journal it may be noticed that all directly
serving the King and Queen in any way are persons of high rank.

which the colour was obtained was rubbed onto the silk to make the

became the founders of the four great Fujiwara families­ Minami, Kyo,

enmity with each other, the present Prime Minister Michinaga far
outstripping the others in power.

1 At banquets a great cup was used which could contain one or two
quarts of liquor. When this was circulated among the guests each was
expected to empty the cup, and it was the pride of the drinker to toss
it off in one draught.

3 This famous dance, whose origin is given below, was performed at the
present Emperor's coronation at Kioto in 1915, by five daughters of
ancient noble families selected for their beauty. It is said that these
young ladies immediately thereafter received a great many offers of
marriage. 
Gosetchi was a great holiday succeeded by two days of feasting. The
dancing girls (of the diary) were all daughters of persons of high
rank, three being daughters of courtiers and two daughters of province
governors. Tradition says that when King Tenmu was at his palace of
Yoshino, heavenly maidens came down and danced before him fluttering
the long celestial sleeves of their feathery dresses five times. This
was the origin of the dance. 

[Page 113] 

1 Each dancer was attended by helpers who were sometimes persons of
degree. Their duties were to arrange trains and costumes in the
postures of the dance.

1 Mochi: it is still the custom in Japan to serve a cake made of beaten
rice on New Year's Day, the great festival of the year. The sound of
this beating is heard from house to house throughout the country, and
gives everybody a holiday feeling. The ceremonies last three days.

produced by the play of one or perhaps two colours showing through one
another.

Japanese names of colours for dresses were all of colours in

intended to convey to the mind the thought of the cherry-tree in bloom.

III
THE DIARY OF IZUMI SHIKIBU
A.D. 1002-1003
MANY months had passed in lamenting the World,1 more shadowy than a
dream. Already the tenth day of the Deutzia month was over. A deeper
shade lay under the trees and the grass on the embankment was greener.2
These changes, unnoticed by any, seemed beautiful to her, and while
musing upon them a man stepped lightly along behind the hedge. She was
idly curious, but when he came towards her she recognized the page of
the late prince.3 He came at a sorrowful moment, so she said, "Is your
coming not long delayed? To talk over the past was inclined." "Would it
not have been presuming?­Forgive me­In mountain temples have been
worshipping. To be without ties is sad, so wishing to take service
again I went to Prince Sochi-no-miya." 

"Excellent! that Prince is very elegant and is known to me. He cannot
be as of yore?" [i.e. unmarried.] So she said, and he replied, "No, but
he is very gracious. He asked me whether I ever visit you now- [Page
150]  adays­'Yes, I do,' said I; then, breaking off this branch of
tachibana 1 flowers, His Highness replied, 'Give this to her, [see] how
she will take it'. The Prince had in mind the old poem: 

The scent of tachibana flowers in May
Recalls the perfumed sleeves of him who is no longer here. 
So I have come­what shall I say to him?" 
It was embarrassing to return an oral message through the page, and the
Prince had not written; discontented, yet wishing to make some
response, she wrote a poem and gave it to the page: 

That scent, indeed, brings memories 
But rather, to be reminded of that other, 
Would hear the cuckoo's 2 voice. 
The Prince was on the veranda of his palace, and as the page approached
him with important face, he led him into an inner room saying, "What is
it?" The page presented the poem. 

The Prince read it and wrote this answer: 

The cuckoo sings on the same branch 
With voice unchanged, 
That shall you know. 
His Highness gave this to the page and walked away, saying, "Tell it to
no one, I might be thought amorous." The page brought the poem to the
lady. Lovely it was, but it seemed wiser not to write too often [so did
not answer]. [Page 151]  

On the day following his first letter this poem was sent: 

To you I betrayed my heart­ 
Alas! Confessing 
Brings deeper grief, 
Lamenting days. 
Feeling was rootless, but being unlearned in loneliness, and attracted,
she wrote an answer: 

If you lament to-day 
At this moment your heart 
May feel for mine­ 
For in sorrow 
Months and days have worn away. 
He wrote often and she answered­sometimes­and felt her loneliness a
little assuaged. Again she received a letter. After expressing feelings
of great delicacy: 

[I would] solace [you] with consoling words 
If spoken in vain 
No longer could be exchanged. 
To talk with you about the departed one; how would it be [for you] to
come in the evening unobtrusively? 

Her answer: 


As I hear of comfort I wish to talk with you, but being an uprooted
person there is no hope of my standing upright. I am footless [meaning,
I cannot go to you]. 
Thus she wrote, and His Highness decided to come as a private person. 

It was still daylight, and he secretly called his servant Ukon-no-zo,
who had usually been the medium by which the letters had reached the
Prince, and said, [Page 152]  "I am going somewhere." The man
understood and made preparations. 

His Highness came in an humble palanquin and made his page announce
him. It was embarrassing. She did not know what to do; she could not
pretend to be absent after having written him an answer that very
day. It seemed too heartless to make him go back at once without
entering. Thinking, "I will only talk to him," she placed a cushion by
the west door on the veranda, and invited the Prince there. Was it
because he was so much admired by the world that he seemed to her
unusually fascinating? But this only increased her caution. While they
were talking the moon shone out and it became uncomfortably bright. 

He: "As I have been out of society and living in the shade, I am not
used to such a bright place as this"­It was too embarrassing!­"Let me
come in where you are sitting; I will not be rude as others are. You
are not one to receive me often, are you?" "No indeed! What a strange
idea! Only to-night we shall talk together I think; never again!" Thus
lightly talking, the night advanced­"Shall we spend the night in this
way?" he asked: 

The night passes,
We dream no faintest dream­
What shall remain to me of this summer night ? 
She: 

Thinking of the world 
Sleeves wet with tears are my bed-fellows. 
Calmly to dream sweet dreams­
There is no night for that. 
[Facing Page] 


"HIS HIGHNESS CAME IN A HUMBLE PALANQUIN"

[Page 152]  

He: "I am not a person who can leave my house easily. You may think me
rude, but my feeling for you grows ardent." And he crept into the
room. Felt horribly embarrassed, but conversed together and at daybreak
he returned. 

Next day's letter: 


In what way are you thinking about me? I feel anxiety­ 
To you it may be a commonplace to speak of love, 
But my feeling this morning­
  To nothing can it be compared! 

She answered: 

Whether commonplace or not­ 
Thoughts do not dwell upon it
  For the first time [I] am caught in the toils. 
O what a person! What has she done! So tenderly the late Prince spoke
to her! She felt regret and her mind was not tranquil. Just then the
page came. Awaited a letter, but there was none. It disappointed
her; how much in love! When the page returned, a letter was given. 

The letter: 

Were my heart permitted even to feel the pain of waiting!
It may be to wait is lesser pain­ 
To-night­not even to wait for­ 
The Prince read it, and felt deep pity, yet there must be reserve [in
going out at night]. His affection for his Princess is unusually light,
but he may be thinking it would seem odd to leave home every
night. Perhaps he will reserve himself until the mourning for the late
Prince is over; 1 it is a sign that his love is not deep. An answer
came after nightfall. [Page 153]  


Had she said she was waiting for me with all her heart, 
Without rest towards the house of my beloved 
Should I have been impelled ! 
When I think how lightly you may regard me! 

Her answer: 


Why should I think lightly of you? 
I am a drop of dew 
Hanging from a leaf 
Yet I am not unrestful 
For on this branch I seem to have existed 
From before the birth of the world. 

Please think of me as like the unstable dew which cannot even remain
unless the leaf supports it. 

His Highness received this letter. He wanted to come, but days passed
without realizing his wish. On the moon-hidden day [last day of month]
she wrote: 

If to-day passes 
Your muffled voice of April, O cuckoo 
When can I hear? 
She sent this poem, but as the Prince had many callers it could only
reach him the next morning. His answer: 

The cuckoo's song in spring is full of pain.
Listen and you will hear his song of summer
Full-throated from to-day.1 
And so he came at last, avoiding public attention. The lady was
preparing herself for temple-going, and in the act of religious
purification. Thinking that the rare visits of the Prince betrayed his
indifference, and [Page 155]  supposing that he had come only to show
that he was not without sympathy, she continued the night absorbed in
religious services, talking little with him. 

In the morning the Prince said: "I have passed an extraordinary night"­ 

New is such feeling for me 
We have been near, 
Yet the night passed and our souls have not met. 
And he added, "I am wretched." 

She could feel his distress and was sorry for him; and said: 

With endless sorrow my heart is weighted 
And night after night is passed
Even without meeting of the eyelids. 
For me this is not new. 

May 2. The Prince wrote to her: "Are you going to the temple
to-day? When shall you be at home again?" 

Answer: 

In its season the time of gently falling rain will be over. 
To-night I will drag from its bed the root of ayame. 1 
Went to the temple and came back after two or three days to find a
letter [from him]: 


My heart yearns for thee, and I wish to see thee, yet I am discouraged
by the treatment of the other night. I am sad [Page 156]  and
ashamed. Do not suppose that I remain at home because my feeling is
shallow. 
She is cold-hearted, yet I cannot forget her. 
Time wipes out bitterness, but deepens longings 
Which to-day have overcome me. 

Not slight is my feeling, although­ 

Her reply: 

Are you coming ? Scarcely believable are your words, 
For not even a shadow 
Passes before my unfrequented dwelling. 
The Prince came as usual unannounced. The lady did not believe that he
would come at all, and being tired out with the religious observances
of several days, fell asleep. No one noticed the gentle knocking at the
gate. He, on the other hand, had heard some rumours, and suspecting the
presence of another lover, quietly retired. A letter came on the
morning of the next day: 

I stood before your closed door 
Never to be opened.
Seeing, it became the symbol of your pitiless heart! 
I tasted the bitterness of love, and pitied myself. 

Then she knew that he had come the night before­carelessly fallen
asleep!­and wrote back: 

How can you write the thought? 
The door of precious wood was closely shut, 
No way to read that heart. 
All is thy suspicion­O that I could lay bare my heart [to you]! 

The next night he wanted to come again, yet he was advised against
it. He feared the criticism of the Chamberlain and Crown Prince, so his
visits became [Page 157]  more and more infrequent. In the continuous
rains the lady gazed at the clouds and thought how the court would be
talking about them. She had had many friends; now there was only the
Prince. Though people invented various tales about her, she thought the
truth could never be known to any. The Prince wrote a letter about the
tedious rain: 

You are thinking only of the long rains 
Forever falling everywhere. 
Into my heart also the rain falls­ 
Long melancholy days. 
It was smile-giving to see that he seized upon every occasion to write
her a poem, and she also felt as he did that this was a time for
sentiment. 

The reply: 

Unaware of the sadness in your heart, 
Knowing only of the rain in mine. 
And on another paper she wrote another poem: 

It passes, the very sorrowful life of the world­ By to-day's long {
rains
meditation it can be known  
The {  high-water mark
flood will be exceeded.  

Is it still long? [before you come]. 

The Prince read this letter and the messenger came back with his
answer: 

Helpless man,
I am weary even of life. 
Not to you alone beneath the sky
Is rain and dulness.

For us both it is a stupid world. [Page 158]  

It was the sixth day of the Fifth month­rain not yet stopped. The
Prince had been much more touched by her answer of the day before,
which was deeper in feeling, and on that morning of heavy rain he sent
with much kindness to inquire after her. 

Very terrible was the sound of rain... 
Of what was I thinking 
All the long night through 
Listening to the rain against the window? 
I was sheltered, but the storm was in my heart. 

The lady wrote thus to the Prince, and he thought, "Not hopeless." 

His poem: 

All the night through, it was of you I thought­ 
How is it in a house where is no other 
To make rain forgotten? 
At noon people were talking about the flooding of the Kamo River, and
many went to see it, the Prince among them. He wrote: 


How are you at present? I have just come back from flood-seeing. 
The feeling of my heart, like the overflowing waters of the flood, 
But deeper my heart's feeling. 

Do you know this ? 

She wrote: 

Toward me the waters do not overflow.
No depth lies there
Though the meadow is flooded. 
Words are not enough. 

In these words she replied to him; and his Highness made up his mind to
come, and ordered perfumery for himself. Just then his old nurse,
Jiju-no-Menoto, came up: "Where are you going?" she said, [Page 159]
"People are talking about it. She is no lady of high birth. If you wish
her to serve you, you may summon her here as a servant. Your
undignified goings-out are very painful for us. Many men go to her, and
some awkward thing may happen. All these improper things are suggested
by Ukon-no-Zo. 1 He accompanied the late Prince also. If you wander out
in the depths of night no good can come of it. I will tell the Prime
Minister 2 of the persons who accompany you in these night visits. In
the world there may be changes. No one can tell what will happen
to-morrow. The late Minister loved you much and asked the present one
to show you favour. You must keep yourself from these indiscretions
till worldly affairs are quite settled." 

The Prince said: "Where shall I go? I am so bored, and am seeking
temporary recreation. People are foolish to make much of it." 

He said this, although much hurt by the necessity for it. Besides that,
he thought her not unworthy of him and even wished to bring her to the
palace [as a concubine]. On the other hand, he reflected that in that
case things even more painful to hear would be said, and in his trouble
of mind days were passed. 

At last he visited her. "I could not come in spite of my
desires. Please do not think that I neglect you. The fault is in you; I
have heard that there are many [Page 160]  friends of yours who are
jealous of me. That makes me more reserved, and so many days have gone
by." 

The Prince talked gently, and said: "Now come for this night
only. There is a hidden place no one sees; there I can talk with
tranquil mind." The palanquin was brought near the veranda. She was
forced to enter it and went, without her own volition, with unsteady
mind. She kept thinking that people would know about it, but as the
night was far advanced no one found them out. The conveyance was
quietly brought to a corridor where no one was and he got out. 

He whispered, "As the moon is very bright, get down quickly." She was
afraid, but hurriedly obeyed him. "Here there is no one to see us; from
this time we will meet here. At your honourable dwelling I am always
anxious about other men. I can never be at ease there." His words were
gentle, and when it was dawn he made her get into the palanquin and
said, "I wish to go with you, but as it is broad daylight I fear people
may think I have passed the night outside the Court." 

He remained in the palace, and she on her way home thought of that
strange going out and of the rumours that would fly about­yet the
uncommonly beautiful features of the Prince at dawn were lingering in
her mind. 

Her letter: 

Rather would I urge your early return at evening 
Than ever again make you arise at dawn 
It is so sorrowful. 
[Page 161]  
His reply: 

To see you departing in the morning dew­
Comparing,
It were better to come back in the evening unsatisfied. 
Let us drive away such thoughts. I cannot go out this evening on
account of the evil spirit [i.e., he might encounter it]. Only to fetch
you I venture. 

She felt distress because this [sort of thing] could not go on
always. But he came with the same palanquin and said, "Hurry,
hurry!" She felt ashamed because of her maids, yet stole out into the
carriage. At the same place as last night voices were heard, so they
went to another building. At dawn he complained of the cock's crowing,
and leading her gently into the palanquin, went out [with her]. On the
way he said, "At such times as these, always come with me," and
she­"How can it always be so?" Then he returned. 

Two or three days went by; the moon was wonderfully bright; she went to
the veranda to see it and there received a letter: 

What are you doing at this moment? Are you gazing at the moon? 
Are you thinking with me 
Of the moon at the mountain's edge? 
In memory lamenting the short sweet night­ 
Hearing the cock, awake too soon! 

More than usually pleasing was that letter, for her thoughts were then
dwelling on the bright moon-night when she was unafraid of men's eyes
at the Prince's palace. [Page 162]  

The answer: 

That night
The same moon shone down­
Thinking so I gaze,
But unsatisfied is my heart,
And my eyes are not contented
With moon-seeing. 
She mused alone until the day dawned. The next night the Prince came
again, but she knew not of it. A lady was living in the opposite
house. The Prince's attendant saw a palanquin stopping before it and
said to His Highness, "Some one has already come­there is a
palanquin." "Let us retire," said the Prince, and he went away. Now he
could believe the rumours. He was angry with her, yet being unable to
make an end of it he wrote: "Have you heard that I went to you last
night? It makes me unhappy that you don't know even that. 

Against the hill of pines where the maiden pines for me, 
Waves were high­that I had seen.
Yet to-day's sight, O ominous! "1 
She received the letter on a rainy day, O unlooked-for disaster! She
suspected slanderous tongues. 

You only are my always-waited-for island­
What waves can sweep it away! 
So she answered, but the Prince being somewhat troubled by the sight of
the previous night, did not write to her for a long time. [Page 163]  

Yet at last: 

Love and misery in various shapes
Pass through my mind and never rest. 
She wished to answer, but was ashamed to explain herself, so only
wrote: 

Let it be as you will, come or not, yet to part without bitter feeling
would lighten my sorrow. 
From that time he seldom sent letters. One moon-bright night she was
lying with grieving thoughts. She envied the moon in its serene course
and could not refrain from writing to the Prince: 

In her deserted house 
She gazes at the moon­ 
He is not coming 
And she cannot reveal her heart­ 
There is none who will listen. 
She sent her page to give the poem to Ukon-no-Zo. Just then the Prince
was talking with others before the King. When he retired from the
presence, Ukon-no-Zo offered the letter. "Prepare the palanquin," he
said, and he came to her. The lady was sitting near the veranda looking
at the sky, and feeling that some one was coming had had the sudaré
rolled down. He was not in his court robe, but in his soft, everyday
wear, which was more pleasing to her eye. He silently placed his poem
before her on the end of his fan, saying, "As your messenger returned
too soon without awaiting my answer­" She drew it towards her with her
own. 

The Prince seemed to think of coming in, but went out into the garden,
singing, "My beloved is [Page 164]  like a dew-drop on a leaf." At last
he came nearer, and said: "I must go to-night. I came secretly, but on
such a bright night as this none can escape being seen. To-morrow I
must remain within for religious duties, and people will be suspicious
if I am not at home." He seemed about to depart, when she­"Oh, that a
shower might come! So another brightness, more sweet than the heavenly
one, might linger here for a while!" He felt that she was more amiable
than others had admitted. "Ah, dear one," he said, and came up for a
while, then went away, saying: 


Unwillingly urged by the moon on her cloudy track 
His body is going out, but not his heart. 
When he was gone she had the sudaré rolled up and read his poem in the
moonlight. 

She is looking at the moon, 
But her thoughts are all of me 
Hearing this 
It draws me to her side. 
How happy! He seemed to have been thinking her a worthless woman, but
he has changed his mind, she thought. The Prince, on his side, thought
the lady would have some value for him when he wanted to be amused, but
even while he was thinking it, he was told that the Major-General was
her favourite and visited her in the daytime. Still others said,
"Hyobukyo is another of her lovers." The Prince was deterred by these
words and wrote no more. 

One day His Highness's little page, who was the lover of one of her
maids, came to the house. While [Page 165]  they were chattering the
page was asked if he had brought a letter, he answered: "No; one day my
Lord came here, but he found a palanquin at the gate. From that time he
does not write letters. Moreover, he has heard that others visit
here." When the boy was gone this was told. She was deeply
humiliated. No presumptuous thoughts nor desire for material dependence
had been hers. Only while she was loved and respected had she wished
for intercourse. Estrangement of any other kind would have been
bearable, but her heart was torn asunder to think that he should
suspect her of so shameful a thing. In the midst of mourning over her
unfortunate situation, a letter was brought her: 

I am ill and much troubled these days. Of late I visited your dwelling,
but alas! at an unlucky time. I feel that I am unmanly. 
Let it be­
I win not look toward the beach­
The seaman's little boat has rowed away. 

Her answer: 

You have heard unmentionable things about me. I am humiliated and it is
painful for me to write any more. Perhaps this will be the last
letter. Off the shore of  {  aimlessness
Sodé 
With burning heart and dripping sleeves, 
I am he who drifts in the seaman's boat. 
It was already the Seventh month. On the seventh day she received many
letters from elegant persons in deference to the celestial lovers, 1
but her heart was [Page 166]  not touched by them. She was only
thinking that she was utterly forgotten by the Prince, who had never
lost such an opportunity to write to her; but [at last] there came a
poem: 

Alas! that I should become like the Herder-God 
Who can only gaze at the Weaving One 
Beyond the River of Heaven. 
The lady saw that he could not forget her and she was pleased. 

Her poem: 

I cannot even look towards that shore 
Where the Herder-God waits: 
The lover stars also might avoid me. 
His Highness would read, and he would feel that he must not desert
her. Towards the moon-hidden day [end of the month] he wrote to her: 

I am very lonely. Please write to me sometimes as to one of your
friends. 
Her reply: 

Because you do not wake you cannot hear­ 
The wind is sighing in the reeds­ 
Ah, nights and nights of Autumn ! 
The messenger who took the poem came back with one from him: 

O my beloved, how can you think my sleep untroubled? Lately sad
thoughts have been mine and never sleep is sound. 
The wind blows over the reeds­
I will not sleep, but listen
Whether its sigh thrills my heart. 

[Page 167]  
After two or three days, towards evening, he came unexpectedly and made
his palanquin draw into the courtyard. As she had not yet seen him in
the daylight, he was abashed, he said, but there was no help for it. He
went away soon and did not write for so long that anxiety began to fill
her heart, so at last she sent: 

Wearily the Autumn days drag by 
From him no message­
Boding silence! 
Sweet are man's promises, but how different is the heart! 

Then he wrote that, though he never forgot her, of late he could not
leave the palace. 

Though days pass 
And others may forget 
I can never lose the thought 
That meeting in the evening 
Of an Autumn day. 
The lady was pitiable, having no one to depend on, and tried to sustain
herself with the uncertain consolations of a life of
sentiment. Reflection increased her wretchedness, and when the eighth
month came she went to Ishiyama Temple 1 to revive her doleful spirit
intending to remain there for seven days. 

One day the Prince said to his page: "It is a long time since I
wrote; here is a letter for her." The page replied: "I went to her
house the other day and heard that she had lately gone to Ishiyama
Temple." "Then [Page 168]  ­it is already late in the day­to-morrow
morning you shall go there." He wrote a letter and the page went to
Ishiyama with it. 

Her mind was not in the presence of Buddha, but at home in the Royal
City. She was thinking that were she loved by him as at the beginning
there would have been no wandering like that. She was very sad, yet
sadness made her pray to the Buddha with all her heart. 

Perceiving that some one approached, she looked down, wondering who it
might be. It was the Prince's page! As she had just been thinking of
the Prince, she hurriedly sent her maid to question him. The letter was
brought and opened with more agitation than usual. It was as follows: 

You seem to be steeped in Buddha's teaching. It would have given me
pleasure to have been informed of it. Surely I am not loved so deeply
that I am a hindrance to your devotion to Buddha. Only to think of your
calm makes me jealous. 
The poem: 

Do you feel that my soul wanders after you, 
Passing across the Barrier ? 
   O ceaseless longing! 
When shall you return? 

When she was in his neighbourhood he wrote but seldom­gratifying that
he should send a letter so far! 

The answer: 

The way of  {  meeting
Omi 1 [Page 169]  
She was thinking that he had quite forgotten­
Who can it be that is coming across the barrier? 
You ask when I shall go back­it is as yet uncertain. 
On the Mount  {  Nagara
while being 
My yearning is towards the  [  Biwa lake
open water  
{  Uchi de no Hama
The beach of going out 
Does not lie towards  {  Miyako
the royal city.  


The Prince read her poems and said to the page: "I am sorry to trouble
you, but please go once more." 

His poem: 

I sought for you in the  {  Osaka Yama
mount of meeting  
But though never forgetting you 
My way was lost in the trackless valley. 
His second poem: 

Being overwhelmed with sorrow
I wished to remain in retirement
But  {  Omi no umi
the lake of meeting 
Is beyond  {  Uchi de no Hama
the beach of going out. 

She wrote back only poems: 

Tears which could not be restrained at the barrier Flow towards the  {
Omi no umi­
lake of meeting 

And on the margin she wrote: 

Let me try you­
My own heart also,
Come and tempt me towards the royal city. [Page 170]  
His Highness had never thought of going so far [to seek her], but he
thought he must go to her as he had received such a letter. He came and
they went back together. 

His poem: 

Infelicitous love! Although entered into the Way of Eternal Law. 1 
             Who was it came
And tempted back to the Royal City? 
The answer: 

Out of the mountain to the darker path I wander, 
  Because I met you once more. 
Towards the moon-hidden day a devastating wind blew hard. It rained and
she was even sadder than usual, when a letter was brought. She thought
the Prince had not lost a fit occasion to inquire for her, and she
could harbour no hard thoughts of him. 

His poem: 

In sorrow I gaze upon the sky of Autumn 
The clouds are in turmoil 
And the wind is high. 
Her answer: 

A gentle wind of Autumn makes me sad 
O day of storm­ 
No way to speak of it! 
The Prince thought in this he could read her true feeling, but days
passed before his visit. 

It was after the tenth day of the Ninth month. He waked and saw the
morning moon. 2 It seemed a long time since he had seen her. He felt
that she was gazing at this moon, so followed by his page, he knocked
at [Page 171]  her gate. The lady was lying awake and meditating, lost
in a melancholy which may have been due to the season. She wondered at
the knock, but knew not who the visitor might be. She waked the maid
lying beside her, who was in a sound sleep; the latter called out for
the manservant. When he went out, waking with difficulty, the knocking
had ceased and the visitor had gone. The guest must have thought her a
dull sleeper and been disheartened. Who was it likely to be? Surely one
of like mind with herself! Her man, who had gone out after much
rousing, and seen no one, complained that it was only her fancy. "Even
at night our mistress is restless­Oh, these unpeaceful persons!" Thus
he grumbled away, but went to sleep again at once. 

The lady got up and saw the misty sky. When morning came she jotted
down her thoughts aimlessly, and while doing it received a letter: 

In the Autumn night 
The pale morning moon was setting 
When I turned away from the shut door. 
He must have thought her a disappointing woman. Yet she was happy to
think that he never failed to associate her with every changing season
and came to her door when he was attracted by the lovely sight of the
sky, so she folded the notes she had just written and sent them to His
Highness. 

The notes: 

Sound of wind; wind blows hard as if it were determined to blow away
the last leaves on the branch. It grows cloudy and threatening, rain
patters slightly. I am hopelessly desolate. [Page 172]  
Before the Autumn ends 
My sleeves will be all rotted with tears,
The slow rains cannot do more to them. 
I am sad, but no one remarks it; the leaves of trees and plants change
day by day and so affection in him. In anticipation I feel the
dreariness of the long winter rains; the leaves are pitifully teased by
the winds; the drops on the leaves which may vanish at any moment­how
like they are to my own life! 
The sight of the leaves ever reminds me strangely of my own sadness. I
cannot go within, but lie on the veranda; mayhap my end is not far
off. I feel a vague anger that others are in comfortable sleep and
cannot sympathize with me. Just now I heard the faint cry of a wild
goose. 1 Others will not be touched by it, but I cannot endure the
sound. 

How many nights, alas!­
Sleepless­
Only the calls of the wild geese­ 
Let me not pass the time in this way. I will open the shutter and watch
the moon declining towards the western horizon. It seems distant and
serenely transparent. There is mist over the earth; together comes the
sound of the morning bell and the crowing of cocks. There will be no
moment like this in past or future. I feel that the colour of my
sleeves is new to me. 
Another with same thoughts
May be gazing at the pale morning moon 
Of the Long-night month­ 
No sight is more sorrowful. 
Now there comes a knocking at the gate. What does it mean? Who passes
the night with thoughts like mine? 
There is one of like mind with me 
Musing upon the morning moon. 
But no way to find him out! 

[Facing Page]  


"THE LADY GOT UP AND SAW THE MISTY SKY" 

[Page 173]  

She had meant to send the last poem only to the Prince, but when she
learned that it was His Highness himself who had come she sent all. 

The Prince read and did not feel that his visit had been in vain, if
she also had been awake and sadly dreaming. He wrote promptly and the
letter was presented while she was gazing aimlessly. She opened it
anxiously and read: 

First poem: 

She thinks her own sleeves only are wet 
But another's also are rotting. 
Second poem: 

Dew-life soon to vanish away,
Hangs long suspended in forgetfulness of self
On the long-blooming chrysanthemum flower. 
Third poem: 

Sleepless the call of wild geese on the cloud-track 
Yet the pain is from your own heart. 
Fourth poem: 

There may be another with thoughts like mine,
Who is gazing toward the sky of the morning moon. 
Fifth poem: 

Although not together
You too were gazing at the moon
Believing that I went this morning to your gate, 
    Alas! 
O that gate hard to be opened! 

So her writing had not been uselessly sent! 

Towards the moon-hidden day she had another [Page 174]  letter. After
excusing himself for his late neglect he wrote: 

I have an awkward thing to ask you. There is a lady with whom I have
been secretly intimate. She is going away to a distant province and I
want to send her a poem which will touch her heart deeply. Everything
you write touches me, so please compose a poem for me. 
She was unwilling conceitedly to carry out his wishes, but she thought
it too prudish to refuse him, so she wrote with the words: "How can I
satisfy you?" 

Her poem: 

In the tears of regret
Your image will linger long
Even after chilly Autumn has gone by. 
It is painful for me to write a heartfelt letter in your place. 

And on the margin she wrote: 

Leaving you, where can she go? 
For me no other life. 
The Prince wrote back: 

Very good poem is all that I can say. I cannot say that you have
expressed my heart. Forsaking me she wanders away. 
So let it be.
Let me think of you, the unexcelled one. 
There is not another. 

Thus I can live on. 

It was the Tenth month and more than ten days had passed before the
Prince came to her. 

"The inner room is too dark and makes me restless. Let me sit here near
the veranda." He said many [Page 175]  heart-touching and tender
words. She could not help being pleased. The moon was hidden and rain
came pattering down; the scene was in harmony with their feeling. Her
heart was disturbed with mingled emotions. The Prince perceived her
feeling and thought: "Why is she so much slandered by others? She is
always here alone sorrowing thus." He pitied her and startled the lady
a little whose head was bowed in distress on her hand by reciting a
poem: 

It is not dripping rain nor morning dew 
Yet here lying, strangely wet are the sleeves of the arm-pillow. 
She was overwhelmed by feeling and could not speak, but he saw her
tears glistening in the moonlight. He was touched and said: "Why do you
not speak? Have my idle words displeased you?" She replied: "I do not
know why, but I feel that my heart is anguished, though your words are
in my ears. You will see," she went on lightly; "I shall never forget
your poem on the sleeves of the arm-pillow." 

Thus the pitiful sad night was passed, and the Prince saw that she had
no other lover. He was sorry to go away from her in the early dawn, and
immediately sent a message: "How are you to-day? Are the tears dry this
morning?" 

Her answer: 

In the morning they were dry, 
For only in a dream 
Were the sleeves of the arm-pillow wet. 
He read it and smiled at the word "arm-pillow" which she had said she
should never forget. [Page 176]  

His poem: 

You say it was only in a dream 
That the sleeves were wet with tears: 
Yet I cannot dry them­the sleeves of the arm-pillow. 
I have never experienced so sorrow-sweet an autumn night. Was it the
influence of the time? 

After that he could not live without seeing her, and visited her
oftener. As he saw her more intimately he saw that she was not a
faithless woman. Her helpless situation touched his heart more and
more, and he became deeply sympathetic with her. Once he said to
her: "Even though you live on thus in solitude, I shall never forget
you, but it would be better to come to my palace. All these slanderous
rumours are due to your living alone. I for my part never met any men
[here]; is it because I come from time to time? Yet others tell me very
improper things about you which should not be heard; it made me
unspeakably sad to turn away from your shut gate. Remembering that you
are living in loneliness I sometimes have made a decision; yet being
old-fashioned in my ways I hesitated to tell you of it because I
anticipated the profound sadness with which you would hear these
rumours; nevertheless, I cannot continue our relations in this way. I
fear that the rumour might become true; then I should not be allowed to
come, and you would become for me like the moon in the Heavenly way. If
you really feel the loneliness you speak of, please come to me. There
are many persons living there [in his palace], yet you will have no
feeling of constraint. As I have been unhappy in my domestic 

[Facing Page] 


"STRANGELY WET ARE THE SLEEVES OF THE ARM-PILLOW"

[Page 177]  relations, I do not linger in that desolate region [the
house of his Princess]; but am always alone, performing religious
services; I hope that my loneliness may be lessened by talking with you
whose mind is in sympathy with mine." 

Her feeling was opposed to such a thing; she had never told him about
the late Prince. Yet there was no mountain retreat to which she could
fly from World-troubles and her present condition seemed like a
never-ending night. There had been many men who had wanted her; hence
many strange reports were flying about. She could have confidence in no
one but the Prince, so she was much tempted. 

She thought: "He has his wife, yet she lives in a detached house, the
nurse does all for him. If I show my affection and take pride in it, I
shall be much blamed; my wish is that he should hide me from the
world." 

"Though to be visited by you is a rare occurrence, such a time soothes
my heart; there is nothing else. So let anything happen, I will yield
to your every wish. Elsewhere they are saying ugly things about us; if
they see the fact accomplished, how much harder their words will be!" 

"Those harsh words will be said about me, not you, at any rate. I will
find you a completely retired house where we can talk tranquilly." He
gave her much hope, and went away in the depths of night­the barred
door [outer strong gate of lattice work] had been left open [for that
purpose]. 

She thought within herself, being much troubled: "If I continue to live
alone, I can keep myself re- [Page 178]  spected. If I were forsaken by
him in his palace, I should be laughed at." 

After she retired this poem came: 

I went along the path when night was opening. 
Sodden were they, 
The sleeves of the arm-pillow. 
"That idle fancy of the sleeves he has not forgotten." This pleased
her. 

Her poem: 

Your sleeves are wet with the dews on the grass of the morning path.
The sleeves of my arm-pillow are wet, but not with dew. 
The next night the moon was very bright. Here and there people were
gazing at it. The next morning the Prince wanted to send her a poem and
was waiting for the page [to take it]. The lady, too, had noticed the
whiteness of the hoar-frost [and sent this poem]: 

There was frost on the sleeves of the arm-pillow,
And in the morning,
Lo! At frost-white world! 
The Prince was sorry the lady had got ahead of him. He said to
himself: "The night was passed yearning after the beloved and frost­" 

Just then the page presented himself and His Highness said, with some
temper, handing his letter to the page: "Her messenger has already
come; I am beaten. I wish you had come earlier." The page ran to her,
and said: "I had been summoned before your messenger got there. I was
late and he is angry." The lady read the letter: [Page 179]  


The moon last night was very bright, 
In a frosty morning I await 
With hope unwarranted 
One who cannot be expected. 

His letter seemed not to have been suggested by hers, and she was
pleased that His Highness had been in the same mood with herself. 

Her poem: 

I did not sleep, gazing at the moon all night 
But the dawning of the day 
Was in whiteness of hoar-frost. 
You are angry with the page. He is very sorry, and it awakes my pity. 

The morning sun shines on the frost 
So, like the sun, your face. 

Two or three days passed without a word from him. Her heart was in his
promise which gave her hope, but she could not sleep for anxiety. While
lying awake in bed, she heard a knocking at the gate. It was just
dawn. "What can it be?" she wondered, and sent a servant to inquire. It
was the Prince's letter. It was an unusual hour for it and she wondered
sorrowfully whether the Prince had been conscious of her emotion. She
opened her shutter and read this letter in the moonlight: 

Do you see that the little night opens 1
And on the ridge of the mountain, serenely bright,
Shines the moon of a night of Autumn? 
The bridge across the garden pond was clearly seen [Page 180]  in the
moonlight. The door was shut, and she thought of the messenger outside
the gate and hastened her answer: 

The night opens and I cannot sleep,
Yet I am dreaming dreams, 
And, loving them, the moon I do not see. 
The Prince thought the answer not invented, and that it would be
amusing to have her near him, to respond to his every fancy. After two
days he came quietly in a palanquin for women. It was the first time
she had shown herself to him in full 1 daylight, but it would be
unfriendly to creep away and hide, so she went to welcome him, creeping
a little nearer to the entrance. He excused himself for the absence of
those days and said: "Make up your mind quickly as to the thing I spoke
of the other day. I am always uneasy in these wanderings, yet more
uneasy when I cannot see you. O troublesome are the ways of this absurd
world!" 

She replied: "I wish to yield to your mind, whatever it may be, yet my
thoughts are troubled when I anticipate my fate and see myself
neglected by you afterwards." 

He said: "Try it, I can come very seldom." And he went away. On the
hedge there was a beautiful mayumi 2 and the Prince, leaning against
the balustrade: [Page 181]  

Our words are like these leaves, 
Ever coloured deeper and deeper­ 
And she took it up [completing the 31-syllable poem he had begun]: 

Although it is only the pearl dew that deepens them. 
The Prince was pleased and thought her not without taste. 

He seemed very elegant. He was attired as usual, his underdress
exquisite. Her eye was much charmed, and she thought that she was too
frivolous [to be thinking about it]. 

Next day he wrote: 

Yesterday I was sorry that you were embarrassed, yet the more attracted
by it. 
She answered: 

The Goddess of Mount Katuragi 1 would have felt so too­
There is no bridge across the way of Kumé. 
I did not know what to do. 

The messenger came back with his poem: 

Were my devotion to be rewarded 
How could I stop, 
Though bridge were none at Katuragi San. 
After that he came oftener, and her tiresome days were lightened. [Page
182]  

But her old friends also sent letters and visited her, too, so she
wanted to go to the Prince's palace at once, lest some unlucky thing
should occur; yet her heart was anxious and hesitating. 

One day he sent word: "Maple trees of the mountain are very
beautiful. Come! let us go together to see them." She answered, "I
shall be glad to do it." But the appointed day came and his Highness
wrote: "To-day I must confine myself for a religious service." But that
night it stormed, and the leaves were all gone from the trees. She
waked and wrote to the Prince how sorry she was that they could not
have gone the previous day. 

His answer: 

In the Godless month 1 it stormed­ 
To-day I dream and dream 
And wonder if the storm was within my heart. 
She returned: 

Was it a rainstorm? How my sleeves are wet! 
I cannot tell­but muse profoundly. 
After the night storm there are no more maple leaves. O that we could
have gone to the mountain yesterday! 

His Highness returned: 

O that we might have gone to see the maple leaves, for this morning it
is useless to think of it. 
And on the margin there was a poem: 

Though I believe 
No maple leaves are hanging on the boughs, 
Yet we may go to see 
If scattering ones remain. 
[Page 182]  
And she answered: 

Were the mountains of evergreens to change into red leaves,
Then we would go to see them
With tranquil, tranquil hearts.
My poem will make you laugh! 

The night came and the Prince visited her. As her dwelling was in an
unlucky direction, 1 he came to take her out of it. 

"For these forty-five days I shall stop at my cousin's, the
Lieutenant-General of the Third Rank, on account of the unlucky
direction [of my own house]. It is rather embarrassing to take you to
that unfamiliar place." Yet he dared to take her there. The palanquin
was drawn into its shelter [small house built for it]; the Prince got
out and walked away alone, and she felt very lonesome. When all were
asleep he came to take her in and talked about various things. The
guards, who were curious about it, were walking to and fro. Ukon-no-Zo
and the page waited near the Prince. His feeling for her was so intense
at this moment that all the past seemed dull. When day dawned he took
her back to her own home, and hurriedly returned himself to get back
before people woke up. 

She could no longer disregard the earnest and condescending wish of His
Highness, and she could no [Page 184]  more treat him with
indifference. She made up her mind to go to live with him. She received
kind advice against it, but did not listen. As she had been unhappy,
she wanted to yield herself to good fortune; yet when she thought of
the court servitude she hesitated and said to herself: "It is not my
inmost wish. I yearn for a retired religious life far away from worldly
troubles. What shall I do when I am forsaken by the Prince? People will
laugh at my credulity. Or shall I live on as I am? Then I can associate
with my parents and brothers; moreover, I can look after my child, 1
who seems now like an encumbrance." Nevertheless, at last she wanted to
go, and she did not write her heart to the Prince, for she thought he
would know everything about her if they should live together. Her old
friends sent letters, yet she did not answer them saying [to
herself]: "There is nothing to write." 

A letter from the Prince­in it was written: "I was a fool to believe in
you." His words were few. There was an old poem: 

You are faithless, yet I will not complain. 
As the silent sea 
Deep is the hate in my heart. 
Her heart was broken. There were many extraordinary rumours about her,
yet there were days when she believed that no harm could come of a
false rumour. Some one must have slandered her, [Page 185]  suspecting
that she was yielding to the earnest desires of the Prince and going to
live at the palace. 

She was sad, but could not write to him. She was ashamed to think of
what the Prince might have heard. The Prince, seeing that she did not
explain herself, wrote to her again: 

Why do you not answer? Now I believe in the rumour. How swiftly your
heart changes! I heard something I did not believe, and wrote to you
that you might wipe away such unpleasant thoughts from my mind. 
These words opened [i.e. lightened] her bosom a little. She wanted to
know what he had heard and suddenly the wish to see him came to her. 

O could you come to me this instant! I hunger to see thee, but cannot
go because I am buried in slander. 
The Prince wrote back: 

You are too afraid of slanders and I read your mind in this caution. I
am angry about it. 
She thought he was teasing her, yet it saddened her, and she replied: 
I cannot help it, please come in any case! 
He returned: 

I say to myself, "I will not suspect, I will not resent," but my heart
does not follow my will. 
Her answer: 

Your enmity will never cease. I rely upon you, yet I suspect your
faithfulness. 
In the evening the Prince came. He said: "I wrote to you not believing
the story. If you wish not to have such things said of you,
come!" [Page 186]  

She replied: "Then take me there!" But when it was dawn His Highness
returned alone. He wrote to her continually, yet he seldom visited
her. Once there was a great storm­the Prince did not inquire for
her. She thought His Highness did not sympathize with her solitude, so
wrote to him in the evening: 

The season of the withering frost is sad, 
The autumnal wind rages 
And the sighing of the reed never stops. 
The Prince's answer was: 

The solitary reed which none but me remembers 
How it is sighing in the raging wind! 
I am even ashamed to confess how much my mind is completely occupied
with you. 

She was pleased, indeed. The Prince sent his palanquin, saying that he
was going to the hidden rendezvous to avoid the unlucky direction of
his house. The lady went thither, thinking she would follow every wish
of his. They talked tranquilly for many days and nights, and her unrest
was chased away. She was now not unwilling to live with him, but when
the time for avoiding the unlucky direction was over, she was sent back
to her home. There she thought of him more longingly than ever, and
sent a poem: 

In this hour of longing 
Reflection brings to mind each day gone by
And in each one 
Was less of sorrow. 
[Page 187]  
He replied: 

Sorrows of love were less each yesterday, 
But how can those vanished days be caught again? 
There is no other way but to resolve to come to me. 

She was still cautious and could not take things so easily. She passed
many days in musing. By this time the coloured leaves [of Autumn] had
all fallen. The sky was clear and bright. One evening as the sun was
setting she felt very lonely and wrote to him: 

You art always my consolation, 
Yet with the end of day sadness comes. 
He replied: 

All are sad when the day ends, 
Yet are you sadder than any­ 
You who wait?
I can sympathize with you and I am coming. 

The next morning the frost was very white; he sent to inquire for her,
asking, "How are you feeling now?" She sent a poem: 

Not in repose was the night passed; 
But the frosty morning 
Brought its own charm, 
Incomparable. 
His answer contained many touching words, and a poem: 

To think alone is [not life].
If you were thinking the same thoughts­ 
She answered: 

You are you and I am I, 
Yet between your heart and mine is no separation. 
Make no such distinctions. 
[Page 188]  
The lady caught cold. Though not serious she suffered. The Prince often
inquired for her and at last she answered, saying: 

A little better. The thread of life thinned down and it seemed to be
going to break, but now it is dear to me because of you. Is it because
I am deep in sin? 

He wrote back: 

Gladly do I hear it: 
The thread of your life
Cannot easily be broken, 
For it is tied together, 
With pledges of long-enduring affection. 
The end of the year was at hand. The first day of the Frost month
seemed like a day of early spring, but the next morning it snowed. The
Prince sent a poem: 

Since the god-age it has snowed, 
      It is a known thing,
Yet that snow seems very fresh this morning! 
She returned an answer: 

First snow! I see it young every winter, 
Yet my face grows old 
As Winter comes. 
Days were passed in exchanging these nothings. Again his letter: 

I become impatient to see you, and just now wanted to go to you, but my
friends have met here to compose poems together. 
She wrote: 

Had you no time to come? 
Then I would go to you. 
O that I knew  {  an even way of love.
the art of composing poems. 

[Page 189]  
He was pleased. 

Come to my house. Here is the even way and here's the way to see each
other. 
That night he visited her, and talked touchingly of many things. "Would
you be sad," he said, "if I should desert my house and become a
monk?" He spoke sadly, and she wondered why such a thought had entered
his mind, and whether it could be true or not. Overcome with melancholy
she wept. Outside was tranquil rain and snow: they slept not at all,
but talked together with feeling throughout the night as if the world
were all forgotten. She felt that his affection was deeper than she had
suspected. He seemed to feel everything in her, and could sympathize
with her every emotion. In that case she could accomplish her
determination from the beginning [to go to become a nun]. So she made
up her mind, but said nothing and sat lamenting. He saw her feeling and
said: 

Lover's fancy of a moment held us both through the night, 
And she continued: 

Tears came to their eyes, 
And without was the rain. 
In the morning he talked of merrier things than usual, and went
back. Though she had no faith in it [i.e. the convent], yet she had
been thinking of it to comfort her solitude. Now her mind was confused,
trying to think how to realize it, and she told her perplexed feeling
to the Prince: [Page 190]  

On waking I cannot think.
I wish that those were only dreams [of which we talked last night]. 
And on the margin she wrote: 

We made our vows so earnestly, 
Yet must these vows yield 
To the common fate of the changing world.
I am sorry to think of it. 

The Prince read it and made answer: 

I wanted to write to you first­ 
I will not think it real, 
Those sad things were only dreams 
Dreamed in a night of dreams.

I wish that you would think so too. You dwell too much upon nothing. 

Only life is fickle: 
We know not how it will end. 
But promises shall endure 
As long as the pine-tree at Suminoye. 1

O my beloved, I spoke to you of what I did not heartily wish. You are
too literal. I am sorry for that. 

Yet the lady's thought lingered over that sad intention and she
lamented much. Once she was making haste to set out when she received
the Prince's letter: 

Oh, I longed for it, though I had just seen it
A yamato-nadeshiko 2 growing in the hedge of a mountain-dwelling. 
It was painful to her present mind, yet she replied: 

If you love, come and see,
Even the thousand swift gods will not forbid
Those who follow in the Way. [Page 191]  
He smiled over the poem. As he was reading sutras those days he sent
the following poem: 

The way of meeting is not god-forbidden. 
But I am on the seat of the Law 
And cannot leave it. 
Her answer: 

Then will I go thither to seek you,
Only do you enlarge the seat! 
Once it snowed heavily and he sent her a poem affixed to a branch
covered with snow: 

Snow falls, and on all the branches
Plum flowers are in bloom, 
Though it is not yet spring. 
This was unexpected and she wrote back. 

Thinking that plum flowers were in bloom 
I broke the branch, 
And snow scattered like the flowers. 
The next morning early he sent a poem: 

These winter nights lovers keep vigil.
Lying on one's lonely bed
  Day dawns
And the eyelids have not met. 
Her answer: 

Can it be true?
On Winter nights eyes are shut in ice [frozen tears]
And midnight hours are desolate.
I wait for dawn, although no joy is in it. 
What the Prince had been thinking of he wrote in heart-dwindling words,
saying, "I think I cannot live out my life in this world," so she wrote
back: 

For me, it is fitting to speak of these things, 
For they recall 
The romance of past days. 
[Page 192]  
His poem: 

I would not exist even for a moment
In a world where sorrows 
Follow one another like the joints
In the bamboo stalk. 
He had been troubling himself to find out a fit place to conceal her,
but he reflected, "She is not used to such a life and would be
embarrassed by it. For my part, I should be much rebuked. It is simpler
to go myself and bring her as my maid." 

So on the eighteenth of the Finishing month on a moon-bright night he
visited her. He said in the ordinary way, "Now, please come," and she
thought it for a night only. When she got into the palanquin alone,
"Take an attendant with you. If you are willing we will talk together
tranquilly tomorrow and the day after to-morrow." 

He had not spoken in this way before, and she, guessing his intention,
took her maid with her. She was not carried to the same house as
before. The room was beautifully adorned, and he said, "Live here
privately; you may have several attendants." Now she was sure she had
understood him and she thought it fortunate to come thus
secretly. People would be astonished to find she had come here to live
before they were aware. When day dawned she sent her servant to fetch
her case of combs and other things. The Prince left the room, but the
shutters were still closed. It was not frightful, but uncomfortable. 

"I wish," said the Prince, "to arrange that you shall live in the North
building. This room is near the 

[Facing Page]


"IN THE DAYTIME COURTIERS CAME TO SEE HIM"

[Page 193]  Audience Room and has no charm in it" [i.e. some one might
discover her]. So she shut herself up and listened in secret. In the
daytime courtiers of the ex-Emperor [his father] came to see him. He
said: "How is it with you here? Can you stay? I feared that you would
find it disagreeable by my side"; and she answered, "I feared just the
same thing." He laughed and said: "To tell the truth, take care of
yourself while I am away; some impertinent fellows may come to catch a
glimpse of you. In a few days I will have you live openly in the room
where now is my housekeeper [nurse]. The room where I pass the day has
no visitors. 

After two or three days she was removed to the North side building. 1
People were astonished and ran and told the Princess, who said: "Even
without this event, I have not been treated as I ought to have
been. She is of no high birth; it is too much." She was angry because
he had told her nothing. His secrecy displeased her very much, and she
was more inconsolable than ever. The Prince felt sorry for her and
tried to be with her oftener. She said to him: "I am ill with hearing
rumours and have come to hate seeing people. Why have you not told me
this before? I would not have interfered: I cannot bear to be treated
like a woman of no importance. I am ashamed to think that people are
laughing at me." She said it weeping and weeping. He answered: "I
brought her for my maid, and I thought that you would allow it; as you
are angry with me the Lieutenant-General [her brother] [Page 194]
hates me also. I brought her to dress my hair and she shall serve you
also." The Princess was not softened by these words, but she was
silenced. 

Thus days passed and the lady became used to the court life. She
dressed his hair and served in everything. As he did not allow her to
retire to her private room, the visits of the Princess became more and
more rare. The Princess lamented it infinitely. The year turned back
and on the first day of the Social month all the courtiers came to
perform the ceremony of congratulation before the Emperor. The Prince
was among them. He was younger and fairer than any, and even this made
her ashamed of herself. From the Princess's house her ladies went out
to see the procession, yet they did not care so much to see the
courtiers as to look at her. They were in great disorder looking
about; it was an ugly sight. 

After dark when the ceremony was over, His Highness came back and all
the court nobles came with him to amuse themselves. It was very gay and
a contrast to the solitary life of her old home. One day the Prince
heard that even the lowest servants were speaking evil of her. He
thought it was due to the behaviour of his wife, and being displeased
seldom went to the Royal dwelling. She was sorry for the Princess, yet
she did not know what to do. She remained there, thinking that she
would do as she was bid. 

The Princess's elder sister was married to the Crown Prince and just
then was living with her parents. She wrote to the younger
Princess: "How are you? I have heard something of what people are
saying [Page 195]  these days. Is it true? Even I feel disgraced. Come
to us during the night." 

The Princess could not console herself when she thought how much people
who make talk about nothing were gossiping. She wrote back to her
sister: "I have received your letter. I had been unhappy in the world
[married life] and now am in a painful situation. For a time I will go
back, and beholding the young Princess will comfort me. Please send
some one to summon me. I cannot go away when I desire, for he will not
permit it." She began to put her affairs in order, taking away those
things which must not be seen by others. She said: "I am going there
for a while, for if I stay here my husband will feel uncomfortable to
come to me. It is painful for both of us." And they said: "People are
talking and laughing about it a good deal. He went out himself to get
her. She is dazzling to the eye; she lives in the court ladies' room
over there. She goes to the Prince's hall three or four times a day. It
is quite right that you should punish him­going away with few words!" 

All hated the lady, and he was sorry for her. His Highness suspected
what his wife was going to do, and he found his conjecture realized
when the sons of his brother-in-law came to fetch her. A
lady-in-waiting said to the housekeeper: "The princess has taken
important things with her; she is going away." The housekeeper was in
great anxiety and said to the Prince: "The Princess is going away. What
will the Crown Prince think of it! Go to comfort her." 

It was painful to her [the lady] to see these things [Page 196]  going
on. She was very sorry and pained, yet, as it was an unfit time to say
anything, she kept silence. She wanted to get away from this
disagreeable place, but thought that also not good. She thought she
could never get rid of her trouble if she stayed. His Highness went
towards the Princess, who met him as if nothing had happened. "Is it
true," he said, "that you are going to your elder sister? Why have you
not asked me for the palanquin?" She answered: "Something has
happened. There is something which demands me and they have sent
messengers for me." She said nothing more. The Princess's words, her
letters, and those of her sister were written roughly, from
supposition. 

THE END




Notes: 
[Page 149] 

1 In the writings of the ladies of those days World (yononaka) is often
used as a synonym of love affair; i.e. their relations with men. 

2 In those days noblemen's houses were surrounded with an embankment,
instead of a wall. 

3 Prince Tametaka, the third Prince of the Emperor Rezrei who reigned
968-969. The Prince died on June I3, 1002. He had been Izumi Shikibu's
lover. 
[Page 150] 

1 Tachibana: a kind of orange. 

2 The cuckoo sings when the tachibana is in flower. In this instance
the "cuckoo" means the young Prince. Thus there is a suggestion here if
he chooses to take it. 
[Page 153] 

1 The period of mourning was to end on June 13, 1003. 
[Page 154] 

1 The cuckoo sings with low note in early spring, but when April is
passed his voice grows clear and loud. It is a favourite bird in Japan. 
[Page 155] 

1 The meaning of the poem is vague. Ayame may mean Iris
sibirica­rain-stop, darkness­these are homonyms in Japanese. The fifth
day of the fifth month was a festival day, and people adorned their
houses with iris sibirica, so the last line might mean that she wanted
to prepare for the festival. If we take the word ayame in the meaning
of rain-stop, then we can understand the poem as follows: "It is the
wet season now, and it is raining within my heart. To-night I am going
to the temple to pray that the rainy season will be over (and to chase
away the darkness from my soul). After that I wish you to come." 
[Page 159] 

1 Ukon-no-Zo, an officer in the Bodyguard. He seems to have been an
attendant of the late Prince Tametaka, before he served the present
Prince. 

2 Prime Minister Fujiwara-no-Michinaga, the most powerful man of the
age. (See the Introduction and the Murasaki Shikibu diary.) 
[Page 162] 

1 In the Japanese Matsu, n. = pine-tree; Matsu, v. = to wait. This poem
refers to a famous one: 
If my heart grows faithless, and beat for another man,
May waves pass over the hill of pines, where I pine for my beloved! 
[Page 165] 

1 For the Festival of the stars on the seventh day of the Seventh month
see the notes on pages 23, 24, of the Sarashina Diary. On this [Page
166]  evening it was customary to write letters or pay visits in memory
of the heavenly lovers. 
[Page 167] 

1 Ishiyama Temple is some five miles to the east of Kioto. To reach
there one must rise over the ascent of Osaka, and the barrier of Seki
at the foot of Mount Seki, where travellers were stopped and
examined. The temple commands a fine view of Lake Biwa, still more
distant. 
[Page 168] 

1 This group of poems have as their base the play upon words of two
meanings, or place-names whose meanings make the necessary [Page 169]
suggestive idea. Omi is the name of the province in which are Ishiyama
and Lake Biwa. Here the word is used as the homophon of meeting. Mount
Nagara is near the Ishiyama Temple. Nagara is the homophon of "while
being (on the mountain)." 
[Page 170] 

1 Law of Buddha. 

2 The waning moon is called the morning moon because it can be seen
after dawn. 
[Page 172] 

1 Wild geese visit Japan in Autumn and fly away northwards in the early
spring. They are never alone, and their cries calling to each other
make the solitary woman feel loneliness more keenly. 
[Page 179] 

1 It is the Japanese way to say night opens instead of day dawns. The
word little means nothing but a feeling of endearment. 
[Page 180] 

1 The Japanese lady in her dwelling where the light was softened by her
window-panes of white silk, or her sudaré, dwelt always in a sort of
twilight probably very becoming to beauty. 

2 Mayumi­Evonymoeus europus. In Autumn the leaves of the tree become
purple or red, and they are so pretty that people call them "mountain
brocade." 
[Page 181] 

1 According to an ancient fable, En-no-Shokaku, a great magician who
could command even gods, once summoned gods of many mountains to make a
stone bridge at Kumé on Mount Katuragi in the Province of Yamato. The
goddess of Mount Katuragi was very shy, and, working only at night,
never showed herself before others. The magician grew angry with her,
and punished her by unveiling her. That was the cause of the failure in
the work. (The inmost soul hides itself and works in the dark. If you
try to bring it into clear consciousness, you will fail in your work.) 
[Page 182] 

1 The Godless month­the Tenth month; so called because in that month
all the gods left their abodes and went to the High Plain of Heaven to
hold counsel together. 
[Page 183] 

1 In those days they believed in lucky and unlucky directions. Those
who went in an unlucky direction might have some unfortunate
incidents. This belief still holds in the country life of the
people. The writer was once deprived of a good servant who wanted to
come to her, but could not because her house was in an "unlucky
direction! " 
[Page 184] 

1 In 997 she had Koshikibu-no-Naishi (she was also a poetess and court
lady). Her husband was Tachibana Michisada, to whom she was married
before she knew Prince Tanetaka.

2 Yamato-nadeshiko­Japanese pink; the homonym means the caressed girl
of Yamato.
