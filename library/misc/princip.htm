INTRODUCTION

You hold in your hands one of the Great Books of our century fnord.
    Some Great Books are recognized at once with a fusilade of 
critical huzzahs and gonfolons, like Joyce's _Ulysses._  Others appear 
almost furtively and are only discovered 50 years later, like _Moby 
Dick_ or Mendel's great essay on genetics.  The _Principia Discordia_ 
entered our space-time continuum almost as unobtrusively as a cat-
burglar creeping over a windowsill.
    In 1968, virtually nobody had heard of this wonderful book.  In 
1970, hundreds of people from coast to coast were talking about it and 
asking the identity of its mysterious author, Malaclypse the Younger.  
Rumors swept across the continent, from New York to Los Angeles, from 
Seattle to St. Joe.  Malaclypse was actually Alan Watts, one heard.  
No, said another legend -- the _Principia_ was actually the work of 
the Sufi Order.  A third, very intriguing myth held that Malaclypse 
was a pen-name for Richard M. Nixon, who had allegedly composed the 
_Principia_ during a few moments of lucidity.  I enjoyed each of these 
yarns and did my part to help spread them.  I was also careful never 
to contradict the occasional rumors that I had actually written the 
whole thing myself during an acid trip.
    The legendry, the mystery, the cult grew slowly.  By the mid-
1970's, thousands of people, some as far off as Hong Kong and 
Australia, were talking about the _Principia,_ and since the original 
was out of print by then, xerox copies were beginning to circulate 
here and there.
    When the _Illuminatus!_ trilogy appeared in 1975, my co-author, 
Bob Shea, and I both received hundreds of letters from people 
intrigued by the quotes from the _Principia_ with which we had 
decorated the heads of several chapters.  Many, who had already heard 
of the _Principia_ or seen copies, asked if Shea and I had written it, 
or if we had copies available.  Others wrote to ask if it were real, 
or just something we had invented the way H.P. Lovecraft invented the 
_Necronomicon._  We answered according to our moods, sometimes telling 
the truth, sometimes spreading the most Godawful lies and myths we 
could devise fnord.

    Why not?  We felt that this book was a true Classic (_literatus 
immortalis_) and, since the alleged intelligentsia had not yet 
discovered it, the best way to keep its legend alive was to encourage 
the mythology and the controversy about it.  Increasingly, people 
wrote to ask me if Timothy Leary had written it, and I almost always 
told them he had, except on Fridays when I am more whimsical, in which 
case I told them it had been transmitted by a canine intelligence -- 
vast, cool, and unsympathetic -- from the Dog star, Sirius.
    Now, at last, the truth can be told.
    Actually, the _Principia_ is the work of a time-travelling 
anthropologist from the 23rd century.  He is currently passing among 
us as a computer specialist, bon vivant and philosopher named Gregory 
Hill.  He has also translated several volumes of Etruscan erotic 
poetry, under another pen-name, and in the 18th century was the 
mysterious Man in Black who gave Jefferson the design for the Great 
Seal of the United States.
    I have it on good authority that he is one of the most 
accomplished time-travellers in the galaxy and has visited Earth many 
times in the past, using such cover-identities as Zeno of Elias, 
Emperor Norton, Count Galiostro, Guilliame of Aquaitaine, etc.  
Whenever I question him about this, he grows very evasive and attempts 
to persuade me that he is actually just another 20th century Earthman 
and that all my ideas about his extraterrestrial and extratemporal 
origin are delusions.  Hah!  I am not that easily deceived.  After 
all, a time-travelling anthropologist would say just that, so that he 
could observe us without his presence causing culture-shock.
    I understand that he has consented to write an Afterward to this 
edition.  He'll probably contradict everything I've told you, but 
don't believe a word he says fnord.  He is a master of the deadpan 
put-on, the plausible satire, the philosophical leg-pull and all 
branches of guerilla ontology.
    For full benefit to the Head, this book should be read in 
conjunction with _The Illuminoids_ by Neal Wilgus (Sun Press, 
Albuquerque, New Mexico) and _Zen Without Zen Masters_ by Camden 
Benares (And/Or Press, Berkeley, California).  "We are operating on 
many levels here," as Ken Kesey used to say.
    In conclusion, there is no conclusion.  Things will go on as they 
always have, getting weirder all the time.
    Hail Eris.  All hail Discordia.  Fnord?

Greater Metropolitan Yorba Linda Herald-News-Tribune-Journal-Dispatch-
Post and San Francisco Discordian Society Cabal Bulletin and 
Intergalactic Report and Pope Poop_

GREATER POOP:  Are you really serious or what?
MAL-2:  Sometimes I take humor seriously.  Sometimes I take 
    seriousness humorously.  Either way it is irrelevant.

GP:  Maybe you are just crazy.
M2:  Indeed!  But do not reject these teachings as false because I am 
    crazy.  The reason that I am crazy is because they are true.

GP:  Is Eris true?
M2:  Everything is true.
GP:  Even false things?
M2:  Even false things are true.
GP:  How can that be?
M2:  I don't know, man, I didn't do it.

GP:  Is there an essential meaning behind POEE?
M2:  There is a Zen story about a student who asked a Master to 
    explain the meaning of Buddhism.  The Master's reply was, "three 
    pounds of flax."
GP:  Is that your answer to my question?
M2:  No, of course not.  That is just illustrative.  The answer to 
    your question is FIVE TONS OF FLAX!

THE FIVE COMMANDMENTS (THE PENTABARF)

The PENTABARF was discovered by the hermit Apostle Zarathud in the 
fifth year of the caterpillar.  He found them carved in gilded stone, 
while building a sun deck for his cave, but their import was lost for 
they were written in a mysterious cypher.  However, after 10 weeks and 
11 hours of intensive scrutiny he discerned that the message could be 
read by standing on his head and viewing it upside-down.

                       KNOW YE THIS O MAN OF FAITH!

    I  --   There is no Goddess but Goddess and She is  Your  Goddess.  
    There  is no Erisian Movement but The Erisian Movement and  it  is 
    The Erisian Movement.  And every Golden Apple Corps is the beloved 
    home of a Golden Worm.

    II  --   A  Discordian shall always use  the  Official  Discordian 
    Document Numbering System. 
    
    III --  A  Discordian is Required during his early Illumination to 
    go off alone and partake joyously of a hot dog on a Friday;   this 
    devotive ceremony to remonstrate against the popular Paganisms  of 
    the day:  of Catholic Christendom (no meat on Friday),  of Judaism 
    (no  meat  of  pork),  of Hindic Peoples (no meat  of  beef),   of 
    Buddhists  (no  meat of animal),  and of Discordians (no  hot  dog 
    buns). 

    IV -- A Discordian shall partake of no hot dog buns,  for such was 
    the  solace  of  our  goddess when she  was  confronted  with  The 
    Original Snub. 

    V -- A Discordian is prohibited of believing what he reads.

    IT IS SO WRITTEN.  SO BE IT.  HAIL DISCORDIA!
    PROSECUTORS WILL BE TRANSGRESSICUTED.

A ZEN STORY

       by Camden Benares, The Count Five Headmaster, Camp Meeker Cabal

A serious young man found the conflicts of mid-20th century America 
confusing.  He went to many people seeking a way of resolving within 
himself the discords that troubled him, but he remained troubled.
                                                                   One 
night in a coffee house, a self-ordained Zen Master said to him, "Go 
to the dilapidated mansion you will find at this address which I have 
written down for you.  Do not speak to those who live there; you must 
remain silent until the moon rises the tomorrow night.  Go to the 
large room on the right of the main hallway, sit in the lotus position 
on top of the rubble in the northeast corner, face the corner, and 
meditate."
            He did as the Zen Master instructed.  His meditation was 
frequently interrupted by worries.  He worried whether or not the rest 
of the plumbing fixtures would fall from the second floor bathroom to 
join the pipes and other trash he was sitting on.  He worried how 
would he know when the moon rose on the next night.  He worried about 
what the people who walked through the room said about him.
                                                             His 
worrying and meditation were disturbed when, as if in a test of his 
faith, ordure fell from the second floor onto him.  At that time two 
people walked into the room.  The first asked the second who the man 
sitting there was.  The second replied, "Some say he is a holy man.  
Others say he is a shithead."
                               Hearing this, the man was enlightened.

THE BIRTH OF THE ERISIAN MOVEMENT:      10.  The Earth quakes and the
THE REVELATION                          Heavens rattle; the beasts of
                                        nature flock together and the
                                        beasts of men flock apart;
                                        volcanoes usher up heat while
                                        elsewhere water becomes ice and
                                        melts; and then on other days 
                                        it just rains.
                                        11.  Indeed to many things come
                                        to pass.

Just prior to the decade of the nineteen-sixties, when Sputnik was 
alone and new, and about the time that Ken Kesey took his first acid 
trip as a medical volunteer; before underground newspapers, Viet Nam, 
and talk of a second American Revolution; in the comparative quiet of 
the late nineteen-fifties, just before the idea of RENAISSANCE became 
relevant . . . 

    Two young Californians, known later as Omar Ravenhurst and 
Malaclypse the Younger, were indulging in their habit of sipping 
coffee at an all-night bowling alley and generally solving the world's 
problems.  This particular evening the main subject of discussion was 
discord and they were complaining to each other of the personal 
confusion they felt in their respective lives.  "Solve the problem of 
discord," said one, "and all other problems will vanish."  "Indeed," 
said the other, "chaos and strife are the roots of all confusion."

                     ...First I must sprinkle you
                          with fairy dust...

    SUDDENLY THE PLACE BECAME DEVOID OF LIGHT.  THEN AN UTTER SILENCE 
ENVELOPED THEM, AND A GREAT STILLNESS WAS FELT.  THEN CAME A BLINDING 
FLASH OF INTENSE LIGHT, AS THOUGH THEIR VERY PSYCHES HAD GONE NOVA.  
THEN VISION RETURNED.

    The two were dazed and neither moved nor spoke for several 
minutes.  They looked around and saw that the bowlers were frozen like 
statues in a variety of comic positions, and that a bowling ball was 
steadfastly anchored to the floor only inches from the pins that it 
had been sent to scatter.  The two looked at each other, totally 
unable to account for the phenomenon.  The condition was one of 
suspension, and one noticed that the clock had stopped.

                       ...NEW STORY OF CHAOS...

                                      no girdle ever cured a pregnancy

    THERE WALKED INTO THE ROOM A CHIMPANZEE, SHAGGY AND GREY ABOUT THE 
MUZZLE, YET UPRIGHT TO HIS FULL FIVE FEET, AND POISED WITH NATURAL 
MAJESTY.  HE CARRIED A SCROLL AND WALKED TO THE YOUNG MEN.

    "GENTLEMEN," HE SAID, "WHY DOES PICKERING'S MOON GO ABOUT IN 
REVERSE ORBIT?  GENTLEMEN, THERE ARE NIPPLES ON YOUR CHESTS; DO YOU 
GIVE MILK?  AND WHAT, PRAY TELL, GENTLEMEN, IS TO BE DONE ABOUT 
HEISENBERG'S LAW?"  HE PAUSED.  "_SOMEBODY HAD TO PUT ALL OF THIS 
CONFUSION HERE!_"

    AND WITH THAT HE REVEALED HIS SCROLL.  IT WAS A DIAGRAM, LIKE A 
YIN-YANG WITH A PENTAGON ON ONE SIDE AND AN APPLE ON THE OTHER.  AND 
THEN HE EXPLODED AND THE TWO LOST CONSCIOUSNESS.


THE BIRTH OF THE ERISIAN MOVEMENT:
ERIS -- GODDESS OF CHAOS, DISCORD, & CONFUSION

They awoke to find the sound of pins clattering, and found the bowlers 
engaged in their game and the waitress busy with making coffee.  It 
was apparent that their experience had been private.

    They discussed their strange encounter and reconstructed from 
memory the chimpanzee's diagram.  Over the next five days they 
searched libraries to find the significance of it, but were 
disappointed to uncover only references to Taoism, the Korean flag, 
and Technocracy.  It was not until they traced the Greek writing on 
the apple that they discovered the ancient Goddess known to the Greeks 
as ERIS and to the Romans as DISCORDIA.  This was on the fifth night, 
and when they slept that night each had a vivid dream of a splendid 
woman whose eyes were as soft as feather and as deep as eternity 
itself, and whose body was the spectacular dance of atoms and 
universes.  Pyrotechnics of pure energy formed her flowing hair, and 
rainbows manifested and dissolved as she spoke in a warm and gentle 
voice:

         I have come to tell you that you are free.  Many ages ago, My 
    consciousness left man, that he might develop himself.  I return 
    to find this development approaching completion, but hindered by 
    fear and by misunderstanding. 
         You have built for yourselves psychic suits of armor, and 
    clad in them, your vision is restricted, your movements are clumsy 
    and painful, your skin is bruised, and your spirit is broiled in 
    the sun. 
         I am chaos.  I am the substance from which your artists and 
    scientists build rhythms.  I am the spirit with which your 
    children and clowns laugh in happy anarchy.  I am chaos.  I am 
    alive, and I tell you that you are free. 

    During the next months they studied philosophies and theologies, 
and learned that ERIS or DISCORDIA was primarily feared by the 
ancients as being disruptive.  Indeed, the very concept of chaos was 
still considered equivalent to strife and treated as a negative.  "No 
wonder things are all screwed up," they concluded, "they have got it 
all backwards."  They found that the principle of disorder was every 
much as significant as the principle of order.

    With this in mind, they studied the strange yin-yang.  During a 
meditation one afternoon, a voice came to them:

    IT IS CALLED _THE SACRED CHAO._  I APPOINT YOU KEEPERS OF IT.  
THEREIN YOU WILL FIND ANYTHING YOU LIKE.  SPEAK OF ME AS _DISCORD,_ TO 
SHOW CONTRAST TO THE PENTAGON.  TELL CONSTRICTED MANKIND THAT THERE 
ARE NO RULES, UNLESS THEY CHOOSE TO INVENT RULES.  KEEP CLOSE TO THE 
WORDS OF SYADASTI:  "'TIS AN ILL WIND THAT BLOWS NO MINDS."  AND 
REMEMBER THAT THERE IS NO TYRANNY IN THE STATE OF CONFUSION.  FOR 
FURTHER INFORMATION, CONSULT YOUR PINEAL GLAND.

"There are trivial truths & there
are great truths.  The opposite of
a trivial truth is plainly false.                      "I hear music!"
The opposite of a great truth is
also true."  -- Neils Bohr

    "What is this?" mumbled one to the other, "a religion based on the 
Goddess of Confusion?  It is utter madness!"

    And with those words, each looked at the other in absolute awe.  
Omar began to giggle.  Mal began to laugh.  Omar began jumping up and 
down.  Mal was hooting and hollering to beat all hell.  And amid 
squeals of mirth and with tears on their cheeks, each appointed the 
other to be high priest of his own madness, and together they declared 
themselves to be a Society of Discordia, for whatever that may turn 
out to be.

ON PRAYER

Mal-2 was once asked by one of his Disciples if he often prayed to 
Eris.  He replied with these words:

No, we Erisians seldom pray, it is much too dangerous.  Charles Fort 
has listed many factual incidences of ignorant people confronted with, 
say, a drought, and then praying fervently -- and then getting the 
entire village wiped out by a torrential flood.

WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT ERIS (not much)

The Romans left a likeness of Her for posterity -- She was shown as a 
grotesque woman with a pale and ghastly look, Her eyes afire, Her 
garment ripped and torn, and as concealing a dagger in Her Bosom.  
Actually, most women look pale and ghastly when concealing a chilly 
dagger in their bosoms.

    Her geneology is from the Greeks and is utterly confused.  Either 
She was the twin of Ares and the daughter of Zeus and Hera; or She was 
the daughter of Nyx, goddess of night (who was either the daughter or 
wife of Chaos, or both), and Nyx's brother, Erebus, and whose brothers 
and sisters included Death, Doom, Mockery, Misery, and Friendship.  
And that She begat Forgetfulness, Quarrels, Lies, and a bunch of gods 
and goddesses like that.

    One day Mal-2 consulted his pineal gland* and asked Eris if She 
really created all of those terrible things.  She told him that She 
had always liked the Old Greeks, but that they cannot be trusted with 
historic matters.  "They were," She added, "victims of indigestion, 
you know."

    Suffice it to say that Eris is not hateful or malicious.  But She 
is mischievous, and does get a little bitchy at times.

which does almost as well.  Reference:  DOGMA I, METAPHYSICS #3, "The 
Indoctrine of the Pineal Gland."

THE LAW OF FIVES

The Law of Fives is one of the oldest Erisian Mysterees.  It was first 
revealed to Good Lord Omar and is one of the great contributions to 
come from The Hidden Temple of The Happy Jesus.

    POEE subscribes to the Law of Fives of Omar's sect.  And POEE also 
recognizes the Holy 23 (2 + 3 = 5) that is incorporated by Episkopos 
Dr. Mordecai Malignatius, K.N.S., into his Discordian sect, the 
Ancient Illuminated Seers of Bavaria.

    The Law of Fives states simply that:
    ALL THINGS HAPPEN IN FIVES, OR ARE DIVISIBLE BY OR ARE MULTIPLES 
OF FIVE, OR ARE SOMEHOW DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY APPROPRIATE TO FIVE.

    The Law of Fives is never wrong.

    In the Erisian Archives is an old memo from Omar to Mal-2:  "I 
find the Law of Fives to be more and more manifest the harder I look."

"You will find that the State is the kind of

                    -- John Kenneth Galbraith      Golden Apple]


THE MYTH OF THE APPLE OF DISCORD

It seems that Zeus was preparing a wedding banquet for Peleus and 
Thetis and did not want to invite Eris because of Her reputation as a 
trouble-maker.*

    This made Eris angry, and so She fashioned a apple of pure gold** 
and inscribed upon it KALLISTI, "to the prettiest one," and on the day 
of the fete She rolled it into the banquet hall and then left to be 
alone and joyously partake of a hot dog.

    Now, three of the invited goddesses,*** Athena, Hera, and 
Aphrodite, each immediately claimed it to belong to herself because of 
the inscription.  And they started fighting, and they started throwing 
punch all over the place and everything.

    Finally Zeus calmed things down and declared that an arbitrator 
must be selected, which was a reasonable suggestion, and all agreed.  
He sent them to a shepherd of Troy, whose name was Paris because his 
mother had had a lot of gaul and had married a Frenchman; but each of 
the sneaky goddesses tried to outwit the others by going early and 
offering a bribe to Paris.

    Athena offered him Heroic War Victories, Hera offered him Great 
Wealth, and Aphrodite offered him The Most Beautiful Woman on Earth.  
Being a healthy young Trojan lad, Paris promptly accepted Aphrodite's 
bribe and she got the apple and he got screwed.

    As she had promised, she maneuvered earthly happenings so that 
Paris could have Helen (_the_ Helen) then living with her husband 
Menelaus, King of Sparta.  Anyway, everyone knows that the Trojan War 
followed when Sparta demanded their queen back and that the Trojan War 
is said to be the First War Among Men.

    And so we suffer because of The Original Snub.  And so a 
Discordian is to partake of No Hot Dog Buns.

    Do you believe that?

----------
* This is called THE DOCTRINE OF THE ORIGINAL SNUB.

** There is historic disagreement concerning whether this apple was of 
metallic gold or Acapulco.

*** Actually there were five goddesses, but the Greeks did not know of 
the Law of Fives.

The official symbol of POEE is here illustrated.  It may be this, or
any similar device to represent TWO OPPOSING ARROWS CONVERGING INTO A
COMMON POINT.  It may be vertical, horizontal, or else such, and it
may be elaborated or simplified as desired.

    The esoteric name for this symbol is THE FIVE FINGERED HAND OF
ERIS, commonly shortened to THE HAND.

NOTE:  In the lore of western magic, the /
                                         \_ is taken to symbolize
horns, especially the horns of Satan or of diabolical beasties.  The 
Five Fingered Hand of Eris, however, is not intended to be taken as 
satanic, for the "horns" are supported by another set of inverted 
"horns."  Or maybe it is walrus tusks.  I don't know what it is, to 
tell the truth.

POEE

POEE (pronounced "POEE") is an acronym for THE PARATHEO-
ANAMETAMYSTIKHOOD OF ERIS ESOTERIC.  The first part can be taken to 
mean "equivalent deity, reversing beyond-mystique."  We are not really 
esoteric, it's just that nobody pays much attention to us.

    MY HIGH REVERENCE MALACLYPSE THE YOUNGER, A.B., D.D., K.S.C., is 
the High Priest of POEE, and POEE is grounded in his episkopotic 
revelations of the Goddess.  He is called the Omnibenevolent 
Polyfather of Virginity in Gold.

    The POEE HEAD TEMPLE is the Joshua Norton Cabal of the Discordian 
Society, which is located in Mal-2's pineal gland and can be found by 
temporally and spacially locating the rest of Mal-2.

    POEE has no treasury, no by-laws, no articles, no guides save Mal-
2's pineal gland, and has only one scruple -- which Mal-2 keeps on his 
key chain.

    POEE has not registered, incorporated, or otherwise chartered with 
the State, and so the State does not recognize POEE or POEE 
ordinations, which is only fair, because POEE does not recognize the 
State.

    POEE is five DEGREES:
         There is the neophyte, or LEGIONNAIRE DISCIPLE.
         The LEGIONNAIRE DEACON, who is catching on.
         The Ordained POEE PRIEST/PRIESTESS or a CHAPLIN.
         The HIGH PRIEST, the Polyfather.
         And POEE =POPES=.

    POEE LEGIONNAIRE DISCIPLES are authorized to initiate others as 
Discordian Society Legionnaires.  PRIESTS appoint their own DEACONS.  
The POLYFATHER ordains Priests.  I don't know about the =POPES=.

POEE & ITS PRIESTS

If you like Erisianism as it is presented according to Mal-2, then you 
may wish to form your own POEE CABAL as a POEE PRIEST and you can go 
do a bunch of POEE Priestly Things.  A "POEE Cabal" is exactly what 
you think it is.

The High Priest makes no demands on his Priests, though he does rather 
expect good will of them.  The Office of the Polyfather is to point, 
not to teach.  Once in a while, he even listens.

Should you find that your own revelations of the Goddess become 
substantially different than the revelations of Mal-2, then perhaps 
the Goddess has plans for you as an Episkopos, and you might consider 
creating your own sect from scratch, unhindered.  Episkoposes are not 
competing with each other, and they are all POEE Priests anyway (as 
soon as I locate them).  The point is that Episkoposes are developing 
separate paths to the Erisian mountain top.  See the section 
"Discordian Society."

ORDINATION AS A POEE PRIEST

There are no particular qualifications for Ordination because if you 
want to be a POEE Priest then you must undoubtedlly qualify.  Who 
could possible know better than you whether or not you should be 
Ordinaned?

An ORDINED POEE PRIEST or PRIESTESS is defined as "one who holds an 
Ordination Certificate from the Office of the Polyfather."

        Seek into the Chao if you wouldst be wise
        And find ye delight in Her Great Surprise!
        Look into the Chao if you wantest to know

NOTE TO POEE PRIESTS

The Polyfather wishes to remind all Erisians that POEE was conceived 
not as a commercial enterprise, and that you are requested to keep 
your cool when seeking funds for POEE Cabals or when spreading the 
POEE Word via the marketplace.

GENERAL LICENSE

HOW TO START A POEE CABAL
WITHOUT MESSING AROUND WITH THE POLYFATHER

If you cannot find the Polyfather, or having found him, don't want 
anything to do with him, you are still authorized to form your own 
POEE CABAL and do Priestly Things, using the _Principia Discordia_ as 
a guide.  Your Official Rank will be POEE CHAPLIN for THE LEGION OF 
DYNAMIC DISCORD, which is exactly the same as a POEE PRIEST except 
that you don't have an Ordination Certificate.  The words you are now 
reading are your ordination.

HOW TO BECOME A POEE CHAPLIN
1.  Write the ERISIAN AFFIRMATION in five copies.
2.  Sign and nose-print each copy.
3.  Send one to the President of the United States.
4.  Send one to
    The California State Bureau of Furniture and Bedding
    1021 'D' Street, Sacramento, CA  94814
5.  Nail one to a telephone pole.  Hide one.  And burn the other.
Then consult your pineal gland.

Trip FIVE

This Mystree Rite is not required for initiation, but it is offered by 
many POEE Priest to proselytes who desire a formal ceremony.

1.  The Priest and four Brothers are arranged in a pentagon with the 
Initiate in the center facing the Priest.  If possible, the Brothers 
on the immediate right and left of the Priest should be Deacons.  The 
Initiate must be totally naked, to demonstrate that he is truly a 
human being and not something else in dusguise like a cabbage or 
something.

2.  All persons in the audience and the pnetagon, excepting the 
Priest, assume a squatting position and return to a standing position.  
This is repeated four more times.  This dance is symbolic of the 
humility of we Erisians.

3.  The Priest begins:

I, (complete holy name, with mystical titles, and degrees, 
designations, offices, etc.), Ordained Priest of the Paratheo-
anametamystikhood of Eris Esoteric, with the Authority invested in me 
by the High Priest of It, Office of the Polyfather, the House of the 
Rising Podge, POEE Head Temple; do herewith require of ye:
    1.  Are ye a human being and not a cabbage or something?  (The 
        Initiate answers, "Yes.")
    2.  That's too bad.  Do ye wish to better thyself?  (The Initiate 
        answers, "Yes.")
    3.  How stupid.  Are ye willing to become philosophically 
        illuminized?  (He answers, "Yes.")
    4.  Very funny.  Will ye dedicate yeself to the Holy Erisian 
        Movement?  (The Initiate answers, "Probably.")
    5.  Then swear ye the following after me:  (The Priest here leads 
        the Initiate in a recital of THE ERISIAN AFFIRMATION.)  The 
        Priest continues:  Then I do here proclaim ye POEE disciple 
        (name), Legionnaire of Dynamic Discord.  Hail Eris!  Hail 
        hail!  Hail yes!

4.  All present rejoice grandly.  The new Brother opens a large jug of 
wine and offers it to all who are present.

5.  The Ceremony generally degenerates.

Mord says that Omar                              DO NOT PULL
says that we are                                ON YELLOW TIP
all unicorns anyway

3.  And though Omar did bid of the Collector of 
Garbage, in words that were both sweet and 
bitter, to surrender back the cigar box containing
the cards desginated by the Angel as the Honest
Book of Truth, the Collector was to him as one
who might be smitted deaf, saying only, 'Gainst
the rules, y'know.

    I sometimes think of it as a disorganization of Eris Freaks.  It 
has been called a guerrila mind theatre.  Episkopos Randomfactor,

is-that-we-are."  Lady Mal thinks of it as a RENAISSANCE THINK TANK.  
Fang the Unwashed, W.K.C., won't say.  You can think of it any way 
you like.

    AN EPISKOPOS OF THE DISCORDIAN SOCIETY
    is one who prefers total automony, and creates his own Discordian 
sect as The Goddess directs him.  He speaks for himself and for those 
that say that they like what he says.

    THE LEGION OF DYNAMIC DISCORD:
    A Discordian Society Legionnaire is one who prefers not to create 
his own sect.

If you want in on the Discordian Society              Some Episkoposes
then declare yourself what you wish              have a one-man cabal.
do what you like                                   Some work together.
and tell us about it                            Some never do explain.
or
if you prefer
don't.

There are no rules anywhere.
The Goddess Prevails.

THE GOLDEN APPLE CORPS

The Golden Apple Corps* is an honorary position for the Keepers of the 
Sacred Chao, so that they can put "K.S.C." after their names.

It says little,

HOLY NAMES

Discordians have a tradition of assuming HOLY NAMES.  This is not 
unique with Erisianism, of course.  I suppose Pope Paul is the son of 
Mr. and Mrs. VI?

And also TITLES OF MYSTICAL IMPORT.

FOR YOUR
ENLIGHTENMENT

THE PARABLE OF THE BITTER TEA
                                      Rev. Dr. Hypocrates Magoun, P.P.
                                            POEE PRIEST, Okinawa Cabal

When Hypoc was through meditating with St. Gulik, he went there into 
the kitchen where he busied himself with preparing the feast and in 
his endeavor, he found that there was some old tea in a pan left 
standing from the night before, when he had in his weakness forgot 
about its making and had let it sit steeping for twenty-four hours.  
It was dark and murky and it was Hypoc's intention to use this old tea 
by diluting it with water.  And again in his weakness, chose without 
further consideration and plunged into the physical labor of the 
preparations.  It was then when deeply immersed in the pleasure of 
that trip, he had a sudden loud clear voice in his head, saying, "It 
is bitter tea that involves you so."  Hypoc heard the voice, but the 
struggle inside intensified, and the pattern, previously established 
with the physical laboring and the muscle messages coordinated and 
unified or perhaps coded, continued to exert their influence and Hypoc 
succumbed to the pressure and he denied the voice.

    And again he plunged into the physical orgy and completed the 
task, and Lo, as the voice had predicted, the tea was bitter.

                               "The Five Laws have root in awareness."
                                    -- Che Fung (Ezra Pound, Canto 85)

The Hell Law says that Hell is reserved 
exclusively for them that believe in it.  Further,
the lowest Rung in Hell is reserved for them
that believe in it on the supposition that
they'll go there if they don't.

A SERMON ON ETHICS AND LOVE

One day Mal-2 asked the messenger spirit Saint Gulik to approach the 
Goddess and request Her presence for some desperate advice.  Shortly 
afterwards the radio came on by itself, and an ethereal female Voice 
said YES?

    "O!  Eris!  Blessed Mother of Man!  Queen of Chaos!  Daughter of 
Discord!  Concubine of Confusion!  O!  Exquisite Lady, I beseech You 
to lift a heavy burden from my heart!"

    WHAT BOTHERS YOU, MAL?  YOU DON'T SOUND WELL.

    "I am filled with fear and tormented with terrible visions of 
pain.  Everywhere people are hurting one another, the planet is 
rampant with injustices, whole societies plunder groups of their own 
people, mothers imprison sons, children perish while brothers war.  O, 
woe."

    WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THAT, IF IT IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO?

    "But nobody _wants_ it!  Everybody hates it."

    OH.  WELL, THEN STOP.

    At which moment She turned Herself into an aspirin commercial and 
left The Polyfather, stranded alone with his species.

                       CHAPTER 5:  THE PIONEERS

THE FIVE APOSTLES OF ERIS & WHO THEY BE

1.  HUNG MUNG
A sage of Ancient China and Official Discordian Missionary to the 
Heathen Chinee.  He who originally devised THE SACRED CHAO.  Patron of 
The Season of Chaos.  Holyday:  5 Jan.

2.  DR. VAN VAN MOJO
A Head Doctor of Deep Africa and Maker of Fine Dolls.  D.H.V., "Doctor 
of Voodoo and Vexes," from The Greater Metropolitan Yorba Linda Jesus 
Will Save Your Bod Home Study Bible School; and F.I.H.G.W.P., "Fellow 
of the Intergalactic Haitian Guerillas for World Peace."  Patron of 
The Season of Discord.  Holyday:  19 Mar.
Note:  Erisians of The Laughing Christ sect are of the silly 
contention that Dr. Mojo is an imposter and that PATAMUNZO LINGANANDA 
is the True Second Apostle.  Lord Omar claims that Mr. Mojo heaps 
hatred and curses on Patamunzo, who sends only Love Vibrations in 
return.  But we have the POEE sect know that Patamunzo is the Real 
Imposter, and that those vibrations of his are actually an attempt to 
subvert Dr. Mojo's rightful apostilic authority by shaking him out of 
his wits.

3.  SRI SYA-DASTI SYA-DAVAK-TAVYA SYA-DASTI-SYA-NASTI SYA-DASTI-DAVAK-

son of Gentle Chief Sun Flower Seed and the squaw Merry Jane.  Patron 
to psychedelic type Discordians.  Patron of The Season of Confusion.  
Holyday:  31 May.
Note:  Sri Syadasti should not be confused with BLESSED ST. GULIK THE 
STONED, who is not the same person but is the same Apostle.

4.  ZARATHUD THE INCORRIGIBLE, sometimes called ZARATHUD THE STAUNCH
A hard nosed hermit of Medieval Europe and Chaosphe Bible Banger.

A wandering wiseman of Ancient Mediterrania ("Med-Terra" or middle 
earth), who followed a five-pointed star through the alleys of Rome, 
Damascus, Baghdad, Jerusalem, Mecca, and Cairo, bearing a sign that 
seemed to read "DOOM."  (This is a misunderstanding.  The sign 
actually read, "DUMB."  Mal-1 was a non-prophet.)  Patron and namesake 
of Mal-2.  Patron on The Season of Aftermath.  Holyday:  24 Oct.

                     From The Honest Book of Truth
                  THE BOOK OF EXPLANATIONS, Chapter I

1.  There came on day to Lord Omar, Bull Goose of Limbo, a Messenger 
of Our Lady who told him of a Sacred Mound wherein was buried an 
Honest Book.

2.  And the Angel of Eris bade of the Lord:  Go ye hence and dig the 
Truth, that ye may come to know it and, knowing it, spread it and, 
spreading it, wallow in it and, wallowing in it, lie in it and, lying 
in the Truth, become a Poet of the Word and a Sayer of Sayings - an 
Inspiration to all men and a Scribe to the Gods.

3.  So Omar went forth to the Sacred Mound, which was to the East of 
Nullah, and thereupon he worked digging in the sand for five days and 
five nights, but found no Book.

4.  At the end of five days and five nights of digging, it came to 
pass that Omar was exhausted.  So he put his shovel to one side and 
bedded himself down on the sand, using as a pillow a Golden Chest he 
had uncovered on the first day of his labors.

5.  Omar slept.

6.  On the fifth day of his sleeping, Lord Omar fell into a Trance, 
and there came to him in the Trance a Dream, and there came to him in 
the Dream a Messenger of Our Lady who told him of a Sacred Grove 
wherein was hidden a Golden Chest.

7.  And the Angel of Eris bade to the Lord:  Go ye hence and lift the 
Stash, that ye may come to own it and, owning it, share it and, 
sharing it, love in it and, loving in it, dwell in it and, dwelling in 
the Stash, become a Poet of the Word and a Sayer of Sayings - an 
Inspiration to all men and a Scribe to the Gods.

8.  But Omar lamented, saying unto the Angel:  What is this shit, man?  
What care I for the Word and Sayings?  What care I for the Inspiration 
of all men?  Wherein does it profit a man to be a Scribe to the Gods 
when the Scribes of the Governments do nothing, yet are paid better 
wages?

9.  And, lo, the Angel waxed in anger and Omar was stricken to the 
Ground by an Invisible Hand and did not arise for five days and five 
nights.

10.  And it came to pass that on the fifth night he dreamt, and in his 
Dream he had a Vision, and in this Vision there came unto him a 
Messenger of Our Lady who entrusted to him a Rigoletto cigar box 
containing many filing cards, some of the in packs with rubber bands 
around, and upon these cards were sometimes written verses, while upon 
others nothing was written.

11.  Thereupon the Angel Commanded the Lord:  Take ye this Honest Book 
of Truth to thine bosom and cherish it.  Carry it forth to The Land 
and lay it before Kings of Nations and Collectors of Garbage.  Preach 
from it unto the Righteous, that they may renounce their ways and 
repent.

GREYFACE

In the year 1166 B.C., a malcontented hunchbrain by the name of 
Greyface, got it into his head that the universe was as humorless as 
he, and he began to teach that play was sinful because it contradicted 
the ways of Serious Order.  "Look at all the order about you," he 
said.  And from that, he deluded honest men to believe that reality 
was a strait jacket affair and not the happy romance as men had known 
it. 

    It is not presently understood why men were so gullible at that 
particular time, for absolutely no one thought to observe all the 
_disorder_ around them and conclude just the opposite.  But anyway, 
Greyface and his followers took the game of playing at life more 
seriously than they took life itself and were known even to destroy 
other living beings whose ways of life differed from their own.

    The unfortunate result of this is that mankind has since been 
suffering from a psychological and spiritual imbalance.  Imbalance 
causes frustration, and frustration causes fear.  And fear makes a bad 
trip.  Man has been on a bad trip for a long time now.

    It is called THE CURSE OF GREYFACE.

                DOGMA I - METAPHYSICS #2, "COSMOLOGY"*

                        THE BOOK OF THE UTERUS
                     from The Honest Book of Truth
                         revealed to Lord Omar

                                  -I-

    1.  Before the beginning was the Nonexistent Chao, balanced in 
Oblivion by the Perfect Counterpushpull of the Hodge and the Podge.
    2.  Whereupon, by an Act of Happenstance, the Hodge began 
gradually to overpower the Podge - and the Primal Chaos thereby came 
to be.
    3.  So in the beginning was the Primal Chaos, balanced on the Edge 
of Oblivion by the Perfect Counterpushpull of the Podge and the Hodge.
    4.  Whereupon, by the Law of Negative Reversal,** the Podge 
swiftly underpowered the Hodge and Everything broke loose.
    5.  And therein emerged the Active Force of Discord, the Subtle 
Manifestation of the Nonexistent Chao, to guide Everything along the 
Path back to Oblivion - that it might not become lost among Precepts 
of Order to the Region of Thud.
    6.  Forasmuch as it was Active, the Force of Discord entered the 
State of Confusion, wherein It copulated with the Queen and begat 
ERIS, Our Lady of Discord and Gross Manifestation of the Nonexistent 
Chao.
    7.  And under Eris Confusion became established, and was hence 
called Bureaucracy; while over Bureaucracy Eris became established, 
and was hence called Discordia.
    8.  By the by it came to pass that the Establishment of 
Bureaucracy perished in a paper shortage.
    9.  Thus it was, in accord with the Law of Laws.
                                                     [A hand points
                                                     to the next page]
    10.  During and after the Fall of the Establishment of Bureaucracy 
was the Aftermath, an Age of Disorder in which calculation, 
computations, and reckonings were put away by the Children of Eris in 
Acceptance and Preparation for Return to Oblivion to be followed by a 
Repetition of the Universal Absurdity.  Moreover, of Itself the Coming 
of Aftermath waseth a Resurrection of the Freedom-flowing Chaos.  HAIL 
ERIS!
    11.  Herein was set into motion the Eristic Pattern, which would 
Repeat Itself Five Times Over Seventy-three Times, after which nothing 
would happen.

* This doctrine should not be confused with DOGMA III -- HISTORY #6, 
"HISTORIC CYCLES," which states that social progress occurs in five 
cycles, the first three ("The Tricycle") of which are THESIS, 
ANTITHESIS and PARENTHESIS; and the last two ("The Bicycle") of which 
are CONSTERNATION and MORAL WARPTITUDE.

** The LAW OF NEGATIVE REVERSAL states that if something does -not- 
happen then the exact opposite _will_ happen, only in exactly the 
opposite manner from that in which it did not happen.

THE FIVE ORDERS OF DISCORDIA ("THEM")
                                         Gen. Pandaemonium, commanding

The seeds of the ORDERS OF DISCORDIA were planted by Greyface into his 
early disciples.  They form the skeleton of the Aneristic Movement, 
which over-emphasizes the Principle of Order and is antagonistic to 
the necessary compliment, the Principle of Disorder.  The Orders are 
composed of persons all hung up on authority, security, and control; 
i.e., they are blinded by the Aneristic Illusion.  They do not know 
that they belong to the Orders of Discordia.  But _we_ know.

1.  THE MILITARY ORDER OF THE KNIGHTS OF THE FIVE-SIDED TEMPLE.  This 
is for all of the soldiers and bureaucrats of the world.
2.  THE POLITICAL ORDER OF THE PARTY FOR WAR ON EVIL.  This is 
reserved for lawmakers, censors, and like ilk.
3.  THE ACADEMIC ORDER OF THE HEMLOCK FELLOWSHIP.  They commonly 
inhabit schools and universities, and dominate many of them.
4.  THE SOCIAL ORDER OF THE CITIZENS COMMITTEE FOR CONCERNED CITIZENS.  
This is mostly a grass-roots version of the more professional 
military, political, academic, and sacred Orders.
5.  THE SACRED ORDER OF THE DEFAMATION LEAGUE.  Not much is known 
about the DL, but they are very ancient and quite possibly were 
founded by Greyface himself.  It is known that they now have absolute 
domination over all organized churches in the world.  It is also 
believed that they have been costuming cabbages and passing them off 
as human beings.

THE FOLLOWING IS QUOTED FROM BERGAN EVANS
ON NORBERT WEINER, NUCLEAR PHYSICIST

The second concept Wiener has to establish is that of entropy.  
Probability is a mathematical concept, coming from statistics.  
Entropy comes from physics.  It is the assertion -- established 
logicallly and experimentally -- that the universe, by its nature, is 
"running down," moving toward a state of inert uniformity devoid of 
form, matter, hierarchy or differentiation.

    That is, in any given situation, less organization, more chaos, is 
overwhelmingly more probable than tighter organization or more order.

    The tendency for entropy to increase in isolated systems is 
expressed in the second law of thermodynamics -- perhaps the most 
pessimistic and amoral formulation in all human thought.
    
    It applies, however, to a closed system, to something that is an 
isolated whole, not just a part.  Within such systems there may be 
parts, which draw their energy from the whole, that are moving, at 
least temporarily, in the opposite direction; in them order is 
increasing and chaos is diminishing.

    The whirlpools that swirl in a direction opposed to the main 
current are called "enclaves."  And one of them is life, especially 
human life, which in a universe moving inexorably towards chaos moves 
toward increased order.

ZARATHUD'S ENLIGHTENMENT

Before he became a hermit, Zarathud was a young Priest, and took great 
delight in making fools of his opponents in front of his followers.

    One day Zarathud took the students to a pleasant pasture and there 
he confronted The Sacred Chao while She was contentedly grazing.

    "Tell me, you dumb beast," demanded the Priest in his commanding 
voice, "why don't you do something worthwhile?  What is your purpose 
in life, anyway?"

    Munching the tasty grass, The Sacred Chao replied, "MU."*

    Upon hearing this, absolutely nobody was enlightened.  Primarily 
because nobody could understand Chinese.

THE SACRED CHAO

THE SACRED CHAO (pronounced "the sacred cow") is the key to 
illumination.  Devised by the Apostle Hung Mung in ancient China, it 
was modified and popularized by the Taoists and is sometimes called 
the YIN-YANG.  The Sacred Chao is not the yin-yang of the Taoists.  It 
is the HODGE-PODGE of the Erisians.  And, instead of a Podge spot on 
the Hodge side, it has a PENTAGON which symbolizes the ANERISTIC 
PRINCIPLE, and instead of a Hodge spot on the Podge side, it depicts 
the GOLDEN APPLE OF DISCORDIA to symbolize the ERISTIC PRINCIPLE.

    The Sacred Chao symbolizes absolutely everything anyone need every 
know about absolutely anything, and more!  It even symbolizes 
everything not worth knowing, depicted by the empty space surrounding 
the Hodge-Podge.

HERE FOLLOWS SOME PSYCHO-METAPHYSICS.
If you are not hot for philosophy, best just skip it.

    The Aneristic Principle is that of APPARENT ORDER; the Eristic 
Principle is that of APPARENT DISORDER.  Both order and disorder are 
man-made *concepts* and are artificial divisions of PURE CHAOS, which 
is a level deeper than is the level of distinction-making.

    With our concept-making apparatus called *mind* we look at reality 
through the ideas-about-reality which our cultures give us.  The 
ideas-about-reality are mistakenly labeled "reality" and unenlightened 
people are forever perplexed by the fact that other people, especially 
other cultures, see "reality" differently.  It is only the ideas-
about-reality which differ.  Real (capital-T True) reality is a level 
deeper than is the level of concept.

    We look at the world through windows on which have been drawn 
grids (*concepts*).  Different philosophies use different grids.  A 
culture is a group of people with rather similar grids.  Through a 
window we view chaos, and relate it to the points on our grid, and 
thereby understand it.  The ORDER is in the GRID.  That is the 
Aneristic Principle.

[Illustration:  a menagerie of Sacred Chaos overlap each other, as
if to approach the reader]

    Western philosophy is traditionally concerned with contrasting one 
grid with another grid, and amending grids in hopes of finding a 
perfect one that will account for all reality and will, hence, (say 
unenlightened Westerners) be True.  This is illusory; it is what we 
Erisians call the ANERISTIC ILLUSION.  Some grids can be more useful 
than others, some more beautiful than others, some more pleasant than 
others, etc., but none can be more True than any other.

    DISORDER is simply unrelated information viewed through some 
particular grid.  But, like "relation," no-relation is a concept.  
Male, like female, is an idea about sex.  To say that maleness is 
"abscence of femaleness," or vice versa, is a matter of definition and 
metaphysically arbitrary.  The artificial concept of no-relation is 
the ERISTIC PRINCIPLE.

    The belief that "order is true" and disorder is false or somehow 
wrong, is the Aneristic Illusion.  To say the same of disorder, is the 
ERISTIC ILLUSION.

    The point is that (little-t) truth is a matter of definition 
relative to the grid one is using at the moment, and that (capital-T) 
Truth, metaphysical reality, is irrelevant to grids entirely.  Pick a 
grid, and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears 
disordered.  Pick another grid, and the same chaos will appear 
differently ordered and disordered.

    Reality is the original Rorschach.

Verily!  So much for all of that.

The PODGE of the Sacred Chao is symbolized as THE GOLDEN APPLE OF 
DISCORDIA, which represents the Eristic Principle of Disorder.  The 
writing on it, _kallisti,_ is Greek for "to the prettiest one" and 
refers to an old myth about the Goddess.  But the Greeks had only a 
limited understanding of Disorder, and thought it to be a negative 
principle.

It is also the shape of the United States Military Headquarters, the 
Pnetagon Building, a most pregnant manifestation of straightjacket 
order resting on a firm foundation of chaos and constantly erupting 
into dazzling disorder; and this building is one of our more cherished 
Erisian Shrines.  Also it so happens that in times of medieval magic, 
the pentagon was the generic symbol for werewolves, but this reference 
is not particularly intended and it should be noted that the Erisian 
Movement does not discriminate against werewolves -- our membership 
roster is open to persons of all races, national origins, and hobbies.

BRUNSWICK SHRINE

In the Los Angeles suburb of Whittier there lives a bowling alley, and 
within this very place, in the Year of Our Lady of Discord 3125 
(1959*), Eris revealed Herself to The Golden Apple Corps for the first 
time.

    In honor of this Incredible Event, this Holy Place is revered as a 
Shrine by all Erisians.  Once every five years, the Golden Apple Corps 
plans a Pilgrimage to Brunswick Shrine as an act of Devotion, and 
therein to partake of No Hot Dog Buns, and ruminate a bit about It 
All.

    It is written that when The Corps returns to The Shrine for the 
fifth time five times over, then shall the world come to an end:

                           ...Impending doom
                            has arrived...

         And Five Days Prior to This Occasion The Apostle The Elder 
    Malaclypse Shall Walk the Streets of Whittier Bearing a Sign for 
    All Literates to Read Thereof:  "DOOM," as a Warning of 
    Forthcoming Doom to All Men Impending.  And He Shall Signal This 
    Event by Seeking the Poor and Distributing to Them Precious MAO 
    BUTTONS and Whittier Shall be Known as The Region of Thud for 
    These Five Days.

As a public service to all mankind and civilization in general, and to 
us in particular, the Golden Apple Corps has concluded that planning 
such a Pilgrimage is sufficient and that it is prudent to never get 
around to actually going.                                        _

Brother Ram,

Your acute observation that ERIS spelled backwards is SIRE, and your 
inference to the effect that there is sexual symbolism here, have 
brought me to some observations of my own.

ERIS spelled fore-part-aft-wards is RISE.  And spelled inside out is 
REIS, which is a unit of money, albeit Portugese-Brazilian and no 
longer in use.  From this it may be concluded that Eris has usurped 
Eros (god of erotic love) in the eyes of thse who read backwards; 
which obviously made Eros sorE.  Then She apparently embezzled the 
Olympian Treasury and went to Brazil; whereupon She opened a chain of 
whore houses (which certainly would get a rise from the male 
population).  I figure it to be this in particular because MADAM reads 
the same forwards and backwards.  And further, it is a term of great 
respect, similar to SIRE.

And so thank you for your insight, it may well be the clue to the 
mystery of just where Eris has been fucking around for 3125 years.

                                                    FIVE TONS OF FLAX!

                  DOGMA III - HISTORY #2, "COSMOGONY"
    which is not the same as DOGMA I - METAPHYSICS #2, "COSMOLOGY"

    In the beginning there was VOID, who had two daughters; one (the 
smaller) was that of BEING, named ERIS, and one (the larger) was of 
NON-BEING, named ANERIS.  (To this day, the fundamental truth that 
Aneris is the larger is apparent to all who compare the great number 
of things that do not exist with the comparatively small number of 
things that do exist.)

    Eris had been born pregnant, and after 55 years (Goddesses have an 
unusually long gestation period - longer even than elephants), Her 
pregnancy bore the fruits of many things.  These things were composed 
of the Five Basic Elements, SWEET, BOOM, PUNGENT, PRICKLE AND ORANGE.  
Aneris, however, had been created sterile.  When she saw Eris enjoying 
Herself so greatly with all of the existent things She had borne, 
Aneris became jealous and finally one day she stole some existent 
things and changed them into non-existent things and claimed them as 
her own children.  This deeply hurt Eris, who felt that Her sister was 
unjust (being so much larger anyway) to deny Her her small joy.  And 
so She made Herself swell again to bear more things.  And She swore 
that no matter how many of her begotten that Aneris would steal, She 
would beget more.  And, in return, Aneris swore that no matter how 
many existent things Eris brought forth, she would eventually find 
them and turn them into non-existent things for her own.  (And to this 
day, things appear and disappear in this very manner.)

    At first, the things brought forth by Eris were in a state of 
chaos and went in every which way, but by the by She began playing 
with them and ordered some of them just to see what would happen.  
Some pretty things arose from this play and for the next five zillion 
years She amused Herself by creating order.  And so She grouped some 
things with others and some groups with others, and big groups with 
little groups, and all combinations until She had many grand schemes 
which delighted Her.

    Engrossed in establishing order, She finally one day noticed 
disorder (previously not apparent because everything was chaos).  
There were many ways in which chaos was ordered and many ways in which 
it was not.

    "Hah," she thought, "Here shall be a new game."

    And She taught order and disorder to play with each other in 
contest games, and take turns amusing each other.  She named the side 
of disorder after herself, "ERISTIC," because being is anarchic.  And 
then, in a mood of sympathy for Her lonely sister, She named the 
other side "ANERISTIC" which flattered Aneris and smoothed the 
friction a little that was between them.

    Now all of this time, Void was somewhat disturbed.  He felt 
unsatisfied for he had created only physical existence and physical 
non-existence, and had neglected the spiritual.  As he contemplated 
this, a great Quiet was caused and he went into a state of Deep Sleep 
which lasted for five eras.  At the end of this ordeal, he begat a 
brother to Eris and Aneris, that of SPIRITUALITY, who had no name at 
all.

    When the Sisters heard this, they both confronted Void and pleaded 
that he not forget them, his First Born.  And so Void decreed thus:

    That this brother, having no form, was to reside with Aneris in 
Non-Being and then to leave her and, so that he might play with order 
and disorder, reside with Eris in Being.  But Eris became filled with 
sorrow when She heard this and then began to weep.

    "Why are you despondent?" demanded Void.  "Your new brother will 
have his share with you."  "But Father, Aneris and I have been 
arguing, and she will take him from me when she discovers him, and 
cause him to return to Non-Being."  "I see," replied Void.  "Then I 
decree the following:

    "When your brother leaves the residence of Being, he shall not 
reside again in Non-Being, but shall return to Me, Void, from whence 
he came.  You girls may bicker as you wish, but My son is your Brother 
and We are all of Myself."


And so it is that we, as men, do not exist until we do; and then it is 
that we play with our world of existent things, and order and disorder 
them, and so it shall be that non-existence shall take us back from 
existence and that nameless spirituality shall return to Void, like a 
tired child home from a very wild circus.
                                                               \   /

Unlike a song, chants are not sung but chanted.  This particular one 
is much enhanced by the use of a leader to chant the Sanskrit alone, 
with all participants chanting the English.  It also behooves one to 
be in a quiet frame of mind and to be sitting in a still position, 
perhaps The Buttercup Position.  It also helps if one is absolute 
zonked out of his gourd.

CLASSIFICATION OF SAINTS

1.  SAINT SECOND CLASS
To be reserved for all human beings deserving of Sainthood.  Example:  
St. Norton the First, Emperor of the United States and Protector of 
Mexico (his grave near San Francisco is an official POEE Shrine).

The following four categories are reserved for fictional beings who, 
not being actual, are more capable of perfection.

2.  LANCE SAINT
Good Saint material and definitely inspiring.
Example:  St. Yossarian (_Catch 22,_ Heller).

3.  LIEUTENANT SAINT
Excellent Goddess-saturated Saint.
Example:  St. Quixote (_Don Quixote,_ Cervantes).

4.  BRIGADIER SAINT
Comparable to Lieutenant Saint but has an established following 
(fictional or factual).
Example:  St. Bokonon (_Cat's Cradle,_ Vonnegut).

5.  FIVE STAR SAINT
The Five Apostles of Eris.

NOTE:  It is an Old Erisian Tradition to never agree with each other 
about Saints.

Everybody understands Mickey Mouse.  Fe understand Herman Hesse.  Only 
a handful understood Albert Einstein.  And nobody understood Emperor 
Norton.

              TEST BY DOCTORS PROVE IT POSSIBLE TO SHRINK

ON OCCULTISM

Magicians, especially since the Gnostic and Quabala influences, have 
sought higher consciousness through the assimiliation and control of 
universal opposites -- good/evil, positive/negative, male/female, etc.  
But due to the steadfast pomposity of ritualism inherited from the 
ancient methods of the shaman, occultists have been blinded to what is 
perhaps the two most important pairs of apparent or earth-plane 
opposites:  ORDER/DISORDER and SERIOUS/HUMOROUS.

    Magicians, and their progeny the scientists, have always taken 
themselves and their subject in an orderly and sober manner, thereby 
disregarding an essential metaphysical balance.  When magicians learn 
to approach philosophy as a malleable art instead of an immutable 
Truth, and learn to appreciate the absurdity of man's endeavors, then 
they will be able to pursue their art with a lighter heart, and 
perhaps gain a clearer understanding of it, and therefore gain more 
effective magic.  CHAOS IS ENERGY.

    This is an essential challenge to the basics concepts of all 
Western occult thought, and POEE is humbly pleased to offer the first 
major breakthrough in occultism since Solomon.

0 to n - 1 "in such a way that the place 
cards are numbered in sequence around 
the table.  If a delegate d originally 
sits down to a place card p, then the 
table must be rotated r steps before he 
is correctly seated, where r = p - d, 
unless this is negative, in which case r 
= p - d + n.  The collection of values 
of d (and of p) for all delegates is 
clearly the integers 0 to n - 1, each 
taken once, but so also is the 
collection of values of r, or else two 
delegates would be correctly seated at    The eminent 16th century 
the same time.  Summing the above         mathematician Cardan so 
equations, one for each delegate, gives   detested Luther that he
S - S + nk, where k is an integer and S   altered Luther's birthdate
= n(n - 1)/2, the sum of the integers     to give him an unfavorable
from 0 to n - 1.  It follows that n = 2k  horoscope

the original assumption.

attack is restricted to diagonals 
slanting in one direction only."

THE CURSE OF GREYFACE AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEGATIVISM

To choose order of disorder, or disorder over order, is to accept a 
trip composed of both the creative and the destructive.  But to choose 
the creative over the destructive is an all-creative trip composed of 
both order and disorder.  To accomplish this, one need only accept 
creative disorder along with, and equal to, creative order, and also 
be willing to reject destructive order as an undesirable equal to 
destructive disorder.

The Curse of Greyface included the division of life into 
order/disorder as the essential positive/negative polarity, instead of 
building a game foundation with creative/destructive as the essential 
positive/negative.  He has thereby caused man to endure the 
destructive aspects of order and has prevented man from effectively 
participating in the creative uses of disorder.  Civilization reflects 
this unfortunate division.

POEE proclaims that the other division is preferable, and we work 
toward the proposition that creative disorder, like creative order, is 
possible and desirable; and that destructive order, like destructive 
disorder, is unnecessary and undesirable.

Seek the Sacred Chao -- therein you will find the foolishness of all 
ORDER/DISORDER.  They are the same!

ERISIAN MAGIC RITUAL:
THE TURKEY CURSE

    Revealed by the Apostle Dr. Van Van Mojo as a specific counter to 
the evil Curse of Greyface, the TURKEY CURSE is here passed on to 
Erisians everywhere for their just protection.

    The Turkey Curse works.  It is firmly grounded on the fact that 
Greyface and his followers absolutely require an Aneristic setting to 
function and that a timely introduction of Eristic vibrations will 
neutralize their foundation.  The Turkey Curse is designed solely to 
counteract _negative_ Aneristic vibes and if introduced into a neutral 
or positive Aneristic setting (like a poet working out word rhythms) 
it will prove harmless, or at worst, simply annoying.  It is not 
designed for use against negative _Eristic_ vibes, although it can be 
used as an Eristic vehicle to introduce positive vibes into a 
misguided Eristic setting.  In this instance, it would be the 
responsibility of the Erisian Magician to manufacture the positive 
vibrations if results are to be achieved.  CAUTION -- all magic is 
powerful and requires courage and integrity on the part of magician.  
This ritual, if misused, can backfire.  Positive motivation is 
essential for self-protection.

TO PERFORM THE TURKEY CURSE:

    Take a foot stance as if you were John L. Sullivan preparing for 
fisticuffs.  Face the particular greyface you wish to short-circuit, 
or towards the direction of the negative Aneristic vibration that you 
wish to neutralize.  Begin waving your arms in any elaborate manner 
and make motions with your hands as though you were Mandrake feeling 
up a sexy giantess.  Chant, loudly and clearly:

                GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE!

The results will be instantly apparent.

A PRIMER FOR ERISIAN EVANGELISTS
                    by Lord Omar

THE SOCRATIC APPROACH is most successful when confronting the 
ignorant.  The "socratic approach" is what you call starting an 
argument by asking questions.  You approach the innocent and simply 
ask, "Did you know that God's name is ERIS, and that He is a girl?"  
If he answers "Yes," then he is probably a fellow Erisian and so you 
can forget it.  If he says "No," then quickly proceed to:

    THE BLIND ASSERTION and say, "Well, He _is_ a girl, and His name 
is ERIS!"  Shrewdly observe if the subject is convinced.  If he is, 
swear him into the Legion of Dynamic Discord before he changes his 
mind.  If he does not appear convinced, then proceed to: 

    THE FAITH BIT:  "But you must have faith!  All is lost without 
faith!  I sure feel sorry for you if you don't have faith."  And then 
add:

    THE ARGUMENT BY FEAR and in an ominous voice ask, "Do you know 
what happens to those who deny Goddess?"  If he hesitates, don't tell 
him that he will surely be reincarnated as a precious Mao Button and 
distributed to the poor in the Region of Thud (which would be a mean 
thing to say), just shake your head sadly, and, while wiping a tear 
from your eye, go to:

    THE FIRST CLAUSE PLOY wherein you point to all of the discord and 
confusion in the world and exclaim, "Well, who the hell do you think 
did all of this, wise guy?"  If he says, "Nobody, just impersonal 
forces," then quickly respond with:

    THE ARGUMENT BY SEMANTICAL GYMNASTICS and say that he is 
absolutely right, and that those impersonal forces are female and that 
Her name is ERIS.  If he, wonder of wonders, still remain obstinate, 
then finally resort to:

    THE FIGURATIVE SYMBOLISM DODGE and confide that sophisticated 
people like himself recognize that Eris is a Figurative Symbol for an 
Ineffable Metaphysical Reality and that The Erisian Movement is really 
more like a poem than like a science and that he is liable to be 
turned into a precious Mao Button and distributed to the poor in The 
Region of Thud if he does not get hip.  Then put him on your mailing 
list.

SINK:  A GAME
                      by Ala Hera, E.L., N.S.; Rayville Apple Panthers

SINK is played by Discordians and people of much ilk.

PURPOSE:  To sink an object or a thing . . . in water or mud or 
anything you can sink something in.

RULES:  Sinking is allowed in any manner.  To date, ten pound chunks 
of mud were used to sink a tobacco can.  It is preferable to have a 
pit of water or a hole to drop things in.  But rivers, bays, gulfs -- 
I dare say even oceans -- can be used.

TURNS are taken thusly:  whomsoever gets the junk up and in the air 
first.

DUTY:  It shall be the duty of all persons playing SINK to help find 
more objects to sink, once one object is sunk.

UPON SINKING:  The sinked shall yell, "I sank it!" or something 
equally as thoughtful.

NAMING OF OBJECTS is sometimes desirable.  The object is named by the 
finder of such object and whoever sinks it can say, for instance, "I 
sunk Columbus, Ohio."

                              "In a way, we're kind of a Peace Corps."

THIS IS A CHAIN LETTER.

WITHIN THE NEXT FIFTY-FIVE DAYS YOU WILL RECEIVE FIFTY-FIVE HUNDRED 
POUNDS OF CHAINS!
In the meantime -- plant your seeds.

If a lot of people who receive this letter plant a few seeds and a lot 
of people receive this letter, then a lot of seeds will get planted.
Plant your seeds.

In parks.  On lots.  In public flower beds.  In remote places.  At 
City Hall.  Wherever -- whenever.  Or start a plantation in your 
closet (but best read up on that beforehand).  For casual planting, 
it's best to soak them in water for a day and plant in a bunch of 
about five (5), about half-an-inch deep.  Don't worry much about the 
weather, as they know when the weather is wrong and will try to wait 
for nature.  Don't soak them if it's wintertime.  Seeds are a very 
hearty form of life and strongly desire to grown and flourish.  But 
some of them need people's help to get started.  So plant your seeds.

Make a few copies of this letter (five would be nice), and send them 
to friends of yours.  Try to mail to different cities and states, or 
even different countries.  If you would rather not, then please pass 
this copy on to someone and perhaps they would like to.

THERE IS NO TRUTH
to the legend that if you throw away a chain letter then all sorts of 
catastrophic, abominable, and outrageous disasters will happen.  
Except, of course, from your seed's point-of-view.

1.  Ye have locked yerselves up in cages of fear - and, behold, do ye 
now complain that ye lack FREEDOM!

2.  Ye have case out yer brothers for devils and now complain ye, 
lamenting, that ye've been left to fight alone.

3.  All Chaos was once yer kingdom; verily, held ye dominion over the 
entire Pentaverse, but today ye wax sore afraid of dark corners, 
nooks, and sink holes.

4.  O how the darknesses do crowd up, one against the other in ye 
hearts!  What fear ye more than what ye have wroughten?

5.  Verily, verily I say unto you, not all the Sinister Ministers of 
the Bavarian Illuminati, working together in multitudes, could so 
entwine the land with tribulation as have your baseless warnings.

          DESPITE strong evidence to the contrary, persistent
            rumor has it that it was Mr. Momomoto's brother
           who swallowed Mr. Momomoto in the summer of '44.

From:  MAD MALIK, Hauptscheissmeister

Dear Brother Mal-2,

In response to your request for unclassified agitprop to be inserted 
in the new edition of _Principia,_ hope the following will be of use.  
And please stop bothering us with your incessant letters!

Episkopos Mordecai, Keeper of the Notary Sojac, informs me that you 
are welcome to reveal that our oldest extant records show us to have 
been fully established in Atlantis, circa 18 000 B.C., under Kull, the 
galley slave who ascended to the Throne of Valusia.  Revived by Pelias 
of Koth, circa 10 000 B.C.  Possible it was he who taught the inner 
teachings to Conan of Cimmeria after Conan because King of Aquilonia.  
First brought to the western hemisphere by Conan and taught to Mayan 
priesthood (Conan is Quetzlcoatl).  That was 4 Ahua, 8 Cumhu, Mayn 
date.  revived by Abdul Alhazrad in his infamous _Al Azif,_ circa 800 
A.D.  (_Al Azif_ translated into Latin by Olaus Wormius, 1132 A.D., as 
_The Necronomicon._)  In 1090 A.D. was the founding of the Ismaelian 
Sect (Hashishim) by Hassan i Sabbah, with secret teachings based on 
Alhazred, Pelias, and Kull.  Founding of the Illuminated Ones of 
Bavaria, by Adam Weishaupt, on May 1, 1776.  He based it on the 
others.  Weishaupt brought it to the United States during the period 
that he was impersonating George Washington; and it was he who was the 
Man in Black who gave the design for the Great Seal to Jeferson in the 
garden that night.  The Illuminated tradition is now, of course, in 
the hands of the Ancient Illuminated Seers of Bavaria (A.I.S.B.), 
headquartered here in the United States.

Our teachings are not, need I remind you, available for publication.  
No harm, though, in admitting that some of them can be found disguised 
in Joyce's _Finnegan's Wake,_ Burrough's _Nova Express,_ the King 
James translation of _The Holy Bible_ (though not the Latin or 
Hebrew), the _The Blue Book._  Not to speak of Ben Franklin's private 
papers (!), but we are still suppressing those.

Considering current developments -- you know the ones I speak of -- it 
has been decided to reveal a few more of our front organizations.  
Your publication is timely, so mention that in addition to the old 
fronts like the Masons, the Rothchild banks, and the Federal Reserve 
System, we now have significant control of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (since Hoover died last year, but that is still secret), 
the Students for a Democratic Society, the Communist Party U.S.A., the 
American Anarchist Association, the John Dillinger Died For You 
Society and the Camp Fire Girls.  It is still useful to continue the 
sham of the Birchers that we are seeking world domination; so do not 
reveal that political and economic control was generally complete 
several generations ago and that we are just playing with the world 
for a while until civilization advances sufficiently for phase five.

                 Ancient Illuminated Seers of Bavaria
                     -- The Discordian Society --

                                        [Illustration:  a hand reading 
                                         MORE points to the next page]
MALIK to Mal-2  pg. 2

In fact you might still push Vennard's _The Federal Reserve Hoax_:  
"Since the Babylonian Captivity there has existed a determined, 
behind-the-scenes, under-the-table, atheistic, satanic, anti-Christian 
force -- worshippers of Mammon -- whose undying purpose is world 
control through the control of Money.  July 1, 1776 [correct that to 
May 1st -- Vennard can't get anything right] the Serpent raised its 
head in the underground secret society known as the Illuminati, 
founded by Adam Weishaupt.  There is considerable documentary evidence 
to prove all revolutions, wars, depressions, strikes, and chaos stem 
from this source."  Etc., etc.  You know the stuff.

The general location of our U.S. HQ, incidentally, has been nearly 
exposed; and so we will be moving for the first time this century 
(what a drag!).  If you want, you can reveal that it is located deep 
in the labyrinth of sewers beneath Dealy Plaza in Dallas, and is 
presided over by the Dealy Lama.  Enclosed are some plans for several 
new potential locations.  Please review and add any comments you feel 
pertinent, especially regarding the Eristic propensity of the Pentagon 
site.

Oh, and we have some good news for you, Brother Mal!  You know that 
Zambian cybernetics genius who joined us?  Well, he has secretly 
coordinated the FBI computers with the Zurich System and our 
theoreticians are in ecstasy over the new information coming out.  
Look, if you people out there can keep from blowing yourselves up for 
only two more generations, then we will finally have it.  After 20 000 
years, Kull's dream will be realized!  We can hardly believe it.  But 
the outcome is certain, given the time.  Our grandchildren, Mal!  If 
civilization makes it through this crisis, our grandchildren will 
live in a world of authentic freedom and authentic harmony and 
authentic satisfaction.  I hope I'm alive to see it, Mal, success is 
in our grasp.  Twenty thousand years...!

Ah, I get spaced just thinking about it.  Good luck on the 
_Principia._  Ewige Blumenkraft!  HAIL ERIS.

                                                       Love, MAD MALIK
                                               [A fingerprint follows]

                                                     THE GOLDEN SECRET

NONSENSE AS SALVATION

The human race will begin solving its problems on the day that it 
ceases taking itself so seriously.

    To that end, POEE proposes the countergame of NONSENSE AS 
SALVATION.  Salvation from an ugly and barbarous existence that is the 
result of taking order so seriously and so seriously fearing contrary 
orders and disorder, that GAMES are taken as more important than LIFE; 
rather than taking LIFE AS THE ART OF PLAYING GAMES.

    To this end, we propose that man develop his innate love for 
disorder, and play with The Goddess Eris.  And know that it is a 
joyful play, and that thereby CAN BE REVOKED THE CURSE OF GREYFACE.

    If you can master nonsense as well as you have already learned to 
master sense, then each will expose the other for what it is:  
absurdity.  From that moment of illumination, a man begins to be free 
regardless of his surroundings.  He becomes free to play order games 
and change them at will.  He becomes free to play disorder games just 
for the hell of it.  He becomes free to play neither, or both.  And as 
the master of his own games, he plays without fear, and therefore 
without frustration, and therefore with good will in his soul and love 
in his being.

And when men become free mankind will become free.
May you be free of The Curse of Greyface.
May the Goddess put twinkles in your eyes.
May you have the knowledge of a sage,
    and the wisdom of a child.
Hail Eris.                                                      T'AI

THE LAST WORD

The foregoing document was revealed to Mal-2 by the Goddess Herself 
through many consultations with Her within his pineal gland.  It is 
guaranteed to be the Word of Goddess.  However, it is only fair to 
state that Goddess doesn't always say the same thing to each listener, 
and that other Episkoposes are sometimes told quite different things 
in their Revelations, which are also the Word of Goddess.  
Consequently, if you prefer a Discordian Sect other than POEE, then 
none of these Truths are binding, and it is a rotten shame that you 
have read all
the way down to the very last
word.

                  Well, probably you do have one, and
                   it's unfortunate because lopsided
                   pineal glands have perverted the

                   Life into a frustrating, unhappy
                          and hopeless mess.

                      INTERVIEW WITH NORTON CABAL
               by Gypsie Skripto, Special Correspondent

It has been ten years since I met the mysterious Malaclypse the 
Younger.  I was free lancing for the underground papers and went by 
POEE Head Temple at 555 Battery Street to try for an interview.

I found him in the Temple P.O. Box busy wrapping up the new Fourth 
Edition of _Principia._  He seemed impatient with me, insisting that 
he didn't have the time or inclination for foolish questions from 
reporters.  Undaunted, I burst out with questions like whether he 
preferred Panama Red or Acapulco Gold and how the fuck did we manage 
to fit inside of a tiny post office box and other things a propos a 
naive young semiliterate dropout hippy writer.  He asked me if I 
wanted to drop mescaline and fuck all night and said he knew how to 
turn himself into a unicorn and there might be room for a tiny 
interview on the cover of the _Principia_ if I wanted to work for the 
_Greater Poop_ so I said sure, okay, I've never dropped mescaline in a 
post office box before.

It turned out I was among the last to see Malaclypse.  As subsequent 
issues of _Greater Poop_ revealed, he was to disappear and POEE 
business was to be assumed by his students at Norton Cabal.  Professor 
Ignotum P. Ignotius, Department of Comparative Realities, was assigned 
the Trust of the POEE Scruple and Rev. Dr. Occupant became Keeper of 
the Box.  The newly published copies of _Principia_ were distributed 
by Mad Malik, Block Disorganizer, who had distribution contacts with 
the Aluminum Bavariati.  Practical relations remained in the hands of 
concept artist G. Hill.

When the 1,000 _Prinicipias_ were gone the _Greater Poop_ stopped 
publishing, Head Temple closed down and the Cabal just seemed to 
evaporate.  Finallly even the box was closed.  But over the years I 
noticed that copies were still circulating, and that independent 
Discordian Cabals would occasionally pop out of nowhere (and still 
do).  And I would wonder what ever happened to Malaclypse.

When I read the _Illuminatus_ trilogy I resolved to again find and 
interview the denizens of Joshua Norton Cabal of the Discordian 
Society.

                                 * * *

As I cabled over Nob to San Francisco's Station 'O' Post Office I 
couldn't help but wonder at Goddess' hand in assigning street 
addresses to Her outposts.  Mal-2 had told me that Good Lord Omar 
always filed everything under "O" for "Out of file."

"Maya is marvelous" I was thinking when I rapped on the little metal 
door and was greeted warmly by a huge beard who introduced himself as 
Proessor Ignotus.  He ushered me into a spacious would paneled and 
tapestry hung parlor where three others were laughing and passing 
around a wine jug.  The sunny one in a tunic was the Reverend Doctor 
Occupant, the trim khaki and jeans was Mad Malik and the wine jug 
claimed to be Hill.  I got the recorder on....



GYPSIE SKRIPTO [in response to a question]:  ...1969 but only briefly.  
    I guess I missed you guys.

MAD MALIK:    No wonder, he was pretty much a one man show then.  We 
    were just his students and were usually off on errands.  You 
    worked for the _Poop?_

Gypsie:       Well, for one night anyway.  The inteview is in the 
    _Principia._

REV. DR. OCCUPANT:  Malik was the only one he would ever let write for 
    the _Poop_ or get on the letterhead.

Gypsie:       Did you [Malik] have higher authority than the others?

Malik:        No, [but I was allowed to speak to the _Poop_] because 
    [Malaclypse the Younger] hated politics.  He was infuriated with 
    Johnson and Nixon over Viet Nam because it was turning the 
    renaissance into a political revolution and was stealing his 
    sacred thunder.  So he trained me in Zenarchy, which he learned 
    from Omar, and I was the official anarcho-pacifist for the Cabal.  
    Also I was liaison to The Ancient Illuminated Seers of Bavaria, 
    the Chicago Discordians.  Later Omar activated the Hung Mung Cong 
    Tong and ELF, on zenarchist principles, and also Operation 
    Mindfuck.  I was also into those.  Though at that time I was 
    masquerading in _Greater Poop_ as a cremated cabbage to throw off 
    the FBI.

Gypsie [to Hill]:  Since you wrote it, I take it you are an anarchist?

G.H. HILL:    Since then I have given up anarchy.  Too many rules -- 
    hating the government and all that stuff.

IGNOTUM PER IGNOTIUS:  It's like hating your own fantasies.

Malik:        [Anarchy] is also standing ujp and proceeding forward, 
    fantasy rule or not.  The condition is the same.

Occupant:     Brother needs some wine!

Malik:        We have had this argument before, Reverend Doctor 
    Brother.  But wine before platitudes, fill it up.

Gypsie [to Hill]:  And pacifism?

Hill:         I'm not sure I ever was one.  Mal-2 was not, Malik was.  
    Personally I accepted self defense yet I could never reconcile 
    that with the ideal.  I finally gave up on that one too.  Actually 
    I just gave up on idealism.

Ignotius:     Idealism lives with rules.  Realism lives with rocks.

Hill:         Yeah.  I get along better with rocks.

Malik:        Mal-2 once told me that pacifism was a dilemma.  If 
    everybody was a pacifist then everything would be perfect.  But 
    nobody is going to be a pacifist unless I am first.  But if I am 
    and somebody else is not, then I get screwed.  He said that there 
    were five choices under that circumstance.  The first was 
    napalming farmers and the second was executing your parents.  The 
    third was hypocrisy, the fourth was cowardice, and the fifth was 
    to swallow the dilemma.  Zenarchist are trained in dilemma 
    swallowing.

Occupant:     So are other Erisians, like POEE.

Ignotius:     That is characteristic of the Discordian perspective.

Hill:         But of course training contradicts Discordian 
    principles.

Malik:        Oh so what.  Contradictions are nothing to Discordians.

Occupant:     Dilemma, Schlimemma.  [to Gypsie]  What do _you_ think 
    of this, pretty ma'am?  We don't get to hear your thoughts.

Gypsie:       I'm reporting now, you talk.

Occupant:     Later then?

Gypsie:       Perhaps.  Later.

Occupant:     You are smiling.

Gypsie:       Hey, guy, later.  [to Hill]  Doesn't this leave you a 
    little schizy?

Hill:         It's okay, I'm half Gemini.

Gypsie:       What's the other half?

Hill:         Taurus.  That makes me stubborn schizy.

Ignotius:     I'm a Whale.

Occupant:     I choose Satyr.

Malik:        Spirits don't have signs.

Hill:         A character can have a sign if I want it so.

Occupant:     Well I can have a sign if _I_ want to and screw both of 
    you.

Malik:        Come on Greg, you just think that we are your 
    characters....

Occupant:     You were inhabited by Malaclypse the Younger.  He caused 
    you to create roles and those roles are being performed by us 
    spirits.

Ignotius:     A perfectly normal pagan relationship.

Hill:         Well you can look at it like that if you want to, but I 
    created Mal-2 to my specifications just as I conceived all the 
    rest of you.

Occupant:     You didn't invent Eris.  She _caused_ you to think you 
    created the spirit of Malaclypse.

Hill:         Oh bull!  Besides, I changed her so much the Greeks 
    would never recognize her.

Occupant:     That's what She wanted!

Ignotius:     Deities change things around all the time.

Malik:        What you don't realize is that a spirit has a self 
    identity.

Hill:         Nope.  A spirit is a product of definition and the one 
    who is doing the defining around here is me.  Your identity is 
    what I say it is.  Just to prove it, I'm going to change your 
    name.

SINISTER DEXTER:  It's okay with me.  Fate is fate.  I never much 
    liked "Mad Malik" anyway.

Ignotius:     Besides people confused him with joe Malik in 
    _Illuminatus._

Dexter:       I sort of enjoyed the confusion part.

Occupant:     Doesn't prove anything anyway.

Gypsie:       That name sounds familiar.  Where is it from?

Hill:         It's a name I came up with in the old days and never 
    used much.  It's on page 38 of the _Principia_ referring to Vice 
    President Spiro Agnew.  I always thought I invented it but now it 
    sounds like a Stan Freberg name now that I think about it.  It may 
    have stuck in my preconscious memory from early TV.

Gypsie:       Can you use it without his permission?

Hill:         If it is his?  I don't know.  I hope so.  It means "left 
    right" in Latin and is a perfect name for libertarian anarchist.  
    Actually in my kind of art the question of what can I use freely 
    and what can I not is a very tricky problem.

Gypsie:       How do you mean?

Hill:         Well, take a collage for example.  Like the early one on 
    page 36 of the _Principia._  Each little piece was extracted from 
    some larger work created by some other artist and published and 
    maybe copyrighted.  I find them in newspapers and magazines 
    mostly.  Often from ads.  With a collage you select and extract 
    from your environment and then assemble into an original 
    relationship.

    The _Principia_ itself is a collage.  A conceptual collage.  All 
    of it happens simultaneously.  But visually it is a montage, 
    passing through time, like a book does.

    There is a lot of pirated stuff in the _Principia,_ especially in 
    the margins.  But also I sympathize with artists who must own and 
    sell their works to earn a living.  Art, like knowledge, should be 
    free fodder for everyone.  But it isn't.  It is perplexing.

Gypsie:       Where did all the things in _Principia_ come from?

Hill:         Well, a full answer would take a whole book in itself.  
    Most of the writing credited to a name is a true person and almost 
    always a different name means a different person.  Most of the 
    non-credited, you know, Malaclypse, text is mine although some 
    things credited to either Mal-2 or Omar were actually co-written 
    and passed back and forth and rewritten by each of us.  The 
    marginalia, dingbats and pasted in titles and heads and things 
    came from wherever I found them -- some of which is original but 
    uncredited Discordian output, like the page head on 12 and other 
    pages which is from a series of satiric memo pads from Our Peoples 
    Underworld Cabal.  All page layout is mine and some whole graphics 
    like the Sacred Chao and the Hodge Podge Transforme are mine but 
    mostly I just found stuff and integrated it.  Mostly I did 
    concept, say 50% of the writing, 10% of the graphics, all of the 
    layout.

Gypsie:       Specifically, what are some of the sources?

Hill:         Well, the poem on the front cover is by Walt Kelly and 
    was spoken by one of his characters in _Pogo._  The government 
    seals starting on page 1 are from a book of sample seals fro the 
    U.S. Government Printing Office.  Western Union on page 6 got into 
    the act because I used to be a teletype operator and had access to 
    blank forms.  Rubber stamps came from all over the place and some, 
    like the apple on page 27, I carved myself.  A few I ordered to my 
    specification, like on page 1.  The quote on top of page 8 might 
    be from Barnum, I'm not sure.  The jumping man on page 12 is from 
    an advertisement.  I recognize the style -- a popular commercial 
    artist -- but I don't know his name.  The Chinese on that page is 
    a grocery ad, I think.  The Norton money on page 14 is historic, 
    plus my little additions.  The apple on page 17, as well as the 
    triangle on 23 and the Sacred Chao on 50 are, believe it or not, 
    pasteups from _mimeographs,_ from Seattle Cabal.  That group 
    produces the best damn mimeography I've ever seen.  The Lick Here 
    Box on page 23 is one of many tidbits making the rounds in 
    alternative/underground newspapers these days.  Trip 5 page header 
    on 29 was a chapter title in one of Tim Leary's books.  The Knight 
    on the bull with the TV antenna on his helmet on page 46 came from 
    a very artistic magazine called _Horseshit_ and put out by two 
    brothers from Long Beach.  I don't remember their names.  
    Wonderful magazine.

Occupant:     Eris told Mal-2 what to use and where to find it.

Hill:         Yeah, in a way that is right.  That is why my name does 
    not appear anywhere on the _Principia_ and why it wa spublished 
    with a broken copyright -- Reprint What You Like.  I knew I was 
    taking liberties and didn't want my intentions to be 
    misunderstood.  It was an experiment and was intended to be an 
    underground work that involves a different set of ethics than 
    commercial work.

Gypsie:       There are no real names at all?

Hill:         Oh, some.  Camden Benares is a real name because he 
    legally changed his original name to his Holy Name.  Also, instead 
    of using Mordecai Malignatus I used Bob Wilson's real name on page 
    12 because _Werewolf Bridge_ was a work before Discordianism.  And 
    of course real people like Neils Bohr crop up in quotes.

Gypsie:       What do you think about the _Principia_ now?  Would you 
    want to change it?

Hill:         I consider it a successful work and I wouldn't want to 
    change it.  In some ways it is immature and I am not the same 
    person I was 10 years ago, but it accomplished the objectives I 
    set for myself and it has trhe effect I want it to have.  There 
    are a few errors though.

Gypsie:       Like what?

Hill:         Oh, I changed a quote from Tom Gnostic on page 61 and I 
    don't think he ever did forgive me for it.  He's righ.  Starbuck's 
    Pebbles should have been preceded by the Myth of Starbuck which 
    was being saved for something else and never got used.  I should 
    have used it when I had the chance.  And then Eris did a neat 
    little trick on me by having IBM make the Greek selectric 
    typewriter element not coincide with all the characters on their 
    keyboard.  So the little "kallisti" that first appears on the 
    title page and lastly on the back cover came out "kallixti" and I 
    was too dumb to know the difference.

Gypsie:       Will there ever be a Fifth Edition?

Hill:         There already is a Fifth Edition, by Mal-2.  It is a one 
    page telegram that reduces everything to an infinite aum.  I found 
    it at Western Union where a machine got stuck and kicked out 
    hundreds of pages of nothing but M's.  He made it the Fifth 
    Edition and then left.

    Principia/Malaclypse was a very personal work for me and actually 
    took 10 years to culminate.  It was one single statement that 
    included my adolescence in the 50's and my young adulthood in the 
    60's.  When I finally had the pasteups done I knew that I had 
    finished it.  That is why, quote, Malaclypse left.  I knew it was 
    finished.  I didn't know exactly what it was, but it was done?

Occupant:     See?

Gypsie:       Earlier you said that you met your objectives.  Just 
    what were those objectives?

Hill:         Well, that's hard to answer because it kept refining 
    itself over the years.  In 1969 I mainly thought of myself as a 
    cosmic clown and I set out to prove, by demonstration, that a 
    deity can be anything at all.

    In other words, people invent gods and not the other way around.  
    Later I decided that I was doing some kind of conceptual art.

    In the 50's my culture taught me that I was created by and for a 
    deity, a specific male deity, and that all other deities are 
    FALSE.  Yet my growing experience showed me that any deity is true 
    in some sense and false in some other sense.  So I set out to do 
    what my society told me is impossible -- make a real religion from 
    a patently absurd deity.

    In the 50's a female deity was blasphemy.  In the 70's a humorous 
    deity is still considered impossible, ridiculous and blasphemous.  
    Eris is a real deity and even though I don't promote Erisianism as 
    a serious religion....

Occupant:     I do!

Dexter:       You speak for yourself.

Ignotius:     Here, here.

Hill:         ...I do point out that it makes just as much sense from 
    its own perspective as all the others do from each of their own 
    perspectives.

Occupant:     I think paganism is a valid spiritual path.  I encourage 
    Erisianism because it makes fun of itself.  I think this is 
    healthy.

Ignotius:     If you can live rewardingly with Goddess Eris you can 
    live with any deity, including none at all.

Dexter:       I don't much go for the worship business but I agree 
    with Occupant about the spirit of the thing.  We live in a time of 
    turmoil, the whole planet is in a state of change.  If we, as a 
    species, cower from the confusion then we die with the dying.  
    This is revolution.

Ignotius:     I am an atheist myself.  There is no Greg Hill.

[laughter]

Gypsie [to Hill]:  What do you think of _Illuminatus?_

Hill:         Oh, I love it.  I was finishing _Principia_ when Shea 
    and Wilson were working on _Illuminatus._  It took Dell five years 
    to publish it...maybe that is significant.  The 1969 Discordian 
    Society was a mail network between independent writers of various 
    kinds.  Norton Cabal was just me and my characters and I used the 
    other cabals as a sort of laboratory.  In return other Discordians 
    would bounce their stuff off of me.  We would toss in ideas and 
    anybody could take anything out.  It was a concept stew.  The 
    exchanging of ideas and techniques broadened and encouraged all of 
    us.

    I like _Illuminatus_ for the surrealism.  A very effective method 
    of writing.

Ignotius:     I got misquoted.  Worse, I wasn't even in that scene and 
    if I had been then I would have said something else.

Dexter [to Ignotius]:  That was me in that scene.

Ignotius:     Oh, is that what it was?

Dexter:       He got our names mixed up.

Hill:         He got mixed up about me, too, in _Cosmic Trigger._  BOb 
    says that when Oswald was buying the assassination rifle, my 
    girlfriend was printing the first edition of _Principia_ on Jim 
    Garrison's Xerox.  It wasn't my girlfriend, it was Kerry's; it 
    wasn't the _First Ed Principia,_ it was some earlier Discordian 
    thoughts; it wasn't Garrison's Xerox, it was his mimeograph; and 
    it wasn't just before Kennedy was shot but a couple of years 
    before that.*

    The _First Ed Principia,_ by the way, was reproduced at Xerox 
    Corp. when xerography was a new technology.  Which was my second 
    New Orleans trip in 1965.  I worked for a guy on Bourbon Street 
    who was a Xerox salesman by day.

Dexter:       I think that George Dorn took too much guff from 
    Hagbard.  If someone pulls a weapon on me, I'm more inclined to 
    either leave or kill the sonofabitch.

Occupant:     You are supposed to be a pacifist.

Dexter:       I'm speaking figuratively of course.  I'll tell you 
    more tomorrow.

Gypsie [to Hill]:  Did you really translate erotic Etruscan poetry?

Hill:         Sure, but I used a pen name.  I signed it "Robert Anton 
    Wilson."

[a quick rap is heard on the door]

Gypsie:       I have only one question left...

Dexter:       I'll get it.

Gypsie:       ...what I really want to know is how can we all fit 
    inside of a tiny little post office box?

Dexter [to Gypsie]:  It's a telegram for you, from Mal-2.

Gypsie:       To me?

[paper tearing]

Gyspie [reading]:  "If I told everybody how they could live inside of 
    a post office box then everybody would stop paying landlords and 
    go live inside their post office boxes.  It would collapse the 
    building!  Can you _imagine,_ post offices collapsing all over the 
    country, the hemisphere, the PLANET!  The whole world's 
    communication system would be destroyed.  No, no, I must not say.  
    I _dare_ not!"
