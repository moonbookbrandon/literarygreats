HELPS TO PRONOUNCIATION
There are three simple rules which practically control Hawaiian 
pronunciation: (1) Give each vowel the German sound. (2) Pronounce each 
vowel. (3) Never allow a consonant to close a syllable.

Interchangeable consonants are many. The following are the most common: h=s; 
l=r; k=t; n=ng; v=w.

PREFACE
Maui is a demi god whose name should probably be pronounced Ma-u-i, i. e., 
Ma-oo-e. The meaning of the word is by no means clear. It may mean "to 
live," "to subsist." It may refer to beauty and strength, or it may have the 
idea of "the left hand" or "turning aside." The word is recognized as 
belonging to remote Polynesian antiquity.

MacDonald, a writer of the New Hebrides Islands, gives the derivation of the 
name Maui primarily from, the Arabic word "Mohyi," which means "causing to: 
live" or "life," applied sometimes to the gods and sornetimes to chiefs as 
"preservers and sustainers" of theirfollowers.

The Maui story probably contains a larger number of unique and ancient myths 
than that of any other legendary character in the mythology of any nation.

There are three centers for these legends, New Zealand in the south, Hawaii 
in the north, and the Tahitian group including the Hervey Islands in the 
east. In each of these groups of islands, separated by thousands of miles, 
there are the same legends, told in almost the same way, and with very 
little variation in names. The intermediate groups of islands of even as 
great importance as Tonga, Fiji or Samoa, possess the same legends in more 
or less of a fragmentarv condition, as if the three centers had been settled 
first when the Polynesians were driven away from the Asiatic coasts by their 
enemies, the Malays. From these centers voyagers sailing away in search of 
adventures would carry fragments rather than complete legends. This is 
exactly what has been done and there are as a result a large number of hints 
of wonderful deeds. The really long legends as told about the demi god Ma-u-
i and his mother Hina number about twenty.

It is remarkable that these legends have kept their individuality. The 
Polynesians are not a very clannish people. For some centuries they have not 
been in the habit of frequently visiting each other. They have had no 
written language, and picture writing of any kind is exceedingly rare 
throughout Polynesia and yet in physical traits, national customs, domestic 
habits, and language, as well as in traditions and myths, the different 
inhabitants of the islands of Polynesia are as near of kin as the cousins of 
the United States and Great Britain.

The Maui legends form one of the strongest links in the mythological chain 
of evidence which binds the scattered inhabitants of the Pacific into one 
nation. An incomplete list aids in making clear the fact that groups of 
islands hundreds and even thousands of miles apart have been peopled 
centuries past by the same organic race. Either complete or fragmentary Maui 
legends are found in the single islands and island groups of Aneityum, 
Bowditch or Fakaofa, Efate, Fiji, Fotuna, Gilbert, Hawaii, Hervey, Huahine, 
Mangaia, Manihiki, Marquesas, Marshall, Nauru, New Hebrides, New Zealand, 
Samoa, Savage, Tahiti or Society, Tauna, Tokelau and Tonga.

S. Percy Smith of New Zealand in his book Hawaiki mentions a legend 
according to which Maui made a voyage after overcoming a sea monster, 
visiting the Tongas, the Tahitian group, Vai-i or Hawaii, and the Paumotu 
Islands. Then Maui went on to U-peru, which Mr. Smith says "may be Peru." It 
was said that Maui named some of the islands of the Hawaiian group, calling 
the island Maui "Maui-ui in remembrance of his efforts in lifting up the 
heavens," Hawaii was named Vai-i, and Lanai was called Ngangai-as if Maui 
had found the three most southerly islands of the group.

The Maui legends possess remarkable antiquity. Of course, it is impossible 
to give any definite historical date, but there can scarcely be any question 
of their origin among the ancestors of the Polynesians before they scattered 
over the Pacific ocean. They belong to the prehistoric Polynesians. The New 
Zealanders claim Maui as an ancestor of their most ancient tribes and 
sometimes class him among the most ancient of their gods, calling him 
"creator of land" and "creator of man." Tregear, in a paper before the New 
Zealand Institute, said that Maui was sometimes thought to be "the sun 
himself," "the solar fire," "the sun god," while his mother Hina was called 
"the moon goddess." The noted greenstone god of the Maoris of New Zealand, 
Potiki, may well be considered a representation of Maui-Tiki-Tiki, who was 
sometimes called Maui-po-tiki.

Whether these legends came to the people in their sojourn in India before 
they migrated to the Straits of Sunda is not certain; but it may well be 
assumed that these stories had taken firm root in the memories of the 
priests who transmitted the most important traditions from generation to 
generation, and that this must have been done before they were driven away 
from the Asiatic coasts by the Malays.

Several hints of Hindoo connection is found in the Maui legends. The 
Polynesians not only ascribed human attributes to all animal life with which 
they were acquainted, but also carried the idea of an alligator or dragon 
with them, wherever they went, as in the mo-o of the story Tuna-roa.

The Polynesians also had the idea of a double soul inhabiting the body. This 
is carried out in the ghost legends more fully than in the Maui stories, and 
yet "the spirit separate from the spirit which never forsakes man" according 
to Polynesian ideas, was a part of the Maui birth legends. This spirit, 
which can be separated or charmed away from the body by incantations was 
called the "hau," When Maui's father performed the religious ceremonies over 
him which would protect him and cause him to be successful, he forgot a part 
of his incantation to the "hau," therefore Maui lost his protection from 
death when he sought immortality for himself and all mankind.

How much these things aid in proving a Hindoo or rather Indian origin for 
the Polynesians is uncertain, but at least they are of interest along the 
lines of race origin.

The Maui group of legends is preminently peculiar. They are not only 
different from the myths of other nations, but they are unique in the 
character of the actions recorded. Maui's deeds rank in a higher class than 
most of the mighty efforts of the demi gods of other nations and races, and 
are usually of more utility. Hercules accomplished nothing to compare with 
"lifting the sky," "snaring the sun," "fishing for islands," "finding fire 
in his grandmother's finger-nails," "learning from birds how to make fire by 
rubbing dry sticks," or "getting a magic bone" from the jaw of an ancestor 
who was half dead, that is dead on one side and therefore could well afford 
to let the bone on that side go for the benefit of a descendant. The Maui 
legends are full of helpful imaginations, which are distinctly Polynesian.

The phrase "Maui of the Malo" is used among the Hawaiians in connection with 
the name Maui a Kalana, "Maui the son of Akalana." It may be well to note 
the origin of the name. It was said that Hina usually sent her retainers to 
gather sea moss for her, but one morning she went down to the sea by 
herself. There she found a beautiful red malo, which she wrapped around her 
as a pa-u or skirt. When she showed it to Akalana, her husband, he spoke of 
it as a gift of the gods, thinking that it meant the gift of Maria or 
spiritual power to their child when he should be born. In this way the 
Hawaiians explain the superior talent and miraculous ability of Maui which 
placed him above his brothers.

These stories were originally printed as magazine articles, chiefly in the 
Paradise of the Pacific, Honolulu; therefore there are sometimes repetitions 
which it seemed best to leave, even when reprinted in the present form.

I.
MAUI'S HOME
"Akalana was the man;
Hira-a-ke-ahi was the wife;
Maui First was born;
Then Maui-waena;
Maui Kiikii was born;
Then Maui of the malo.""

-Queen Liliuokalani's Family Chant.

FOUR BROTHERS, each bearing the name of Maui, belong to Hawaiian legend. 
They accomplished little as a family, except on special occasions when the 
youngest of the household awakened his brothers by some unexpected trick 
which drew them into unwonted action. The legends of Hawaii, Tonga, Tahiti, 
New Zealand and the Hervey group make this youngest Maui "the discoverer of 
fire" or "the ensnarer of the sun" or "the fisherman who pulls up islands" 
or "the man endowed with magic," or "Maui with spirit power." The legends 
vary somewhat, of course, but not as much as might be expected when the 
thousands of miles between various groups of islands are taken into 
consideration.

Maui was one of the Polynesian demi-gods. His parents belonged to the family 
of supernatural beings. He himself was possessed of supernatural powers and 
was supposed to make use of all manner of enchantments. In New Zealand 
antiquity a Maui was said to have assisted other gods in the creation of 
man. Nevertheless Maui was very human. He lived in thatched houses, had 
wives and children, and was scolded by the women for not properly supporting 
his household.

The time of his sojourn among men is very indefinite. In Hawaiian 
genealogies Maui and his brothers were placed among the descendants of Ulu 
and "the sons of Kii," and Maui was one of the ancestors of Kamehameha, the 
first king of the united Hawaiian Islands. This would place him in the 
seventh or eighth century of the Christian Era. But it is more probable that 
Maui belongs to the mist-land of time. His mischievous pranks with the 
various gods would make him another Mercury living in any age from the 
creation to the beginning of the Christian era.

The Hervey Island legends state that Maui's father was "the supporter of the 
heavens" and his mother "the guardian of the road to the invisible world."

In the Hawaiian chant, Akalana was the name of his father. In other groups 
this was the name by which his mother was known. Kanaloa, the god, is 
sometimes known as the father of Maui. In Hawaii Hina was his mother. 
Elsewhere Ina, or Hina, was the grandmother, from whom he secured fire.

The Hervey Island legends say that four mighty ones lived in the old world 
from which their ancestors came. This old world bore the name Ava-iki, which 
is the same as Hawa-ii, or Hawaii. The four gods were Mauike, Ra, Ru, and 
Bua-Taranga.

It is interesting to trace the connection of these four names with 
Polynesian mythology. Mauike is the same as the demi-god of New Zealand, 
Mafuike. On other islands the name is spelled Mauika, Mafuika, Mafuia, 
Mafuie, and Mahuika. Ra, the sun god of Egypt, is the same as Ra in New 
Zealand and La (sun) in Hawaii. Ru, the supporter of the heavens, is 
probably the Ku of Hawaii, and the Tu of New Zealand and other islands, one 
of the greatest of the gods worshiped by the ancient Hawaiians. The fourth 
mighty one from Ava-ika was a woman, Bua-taranga, who guarded the path to 
the underworld. Talanga in Samoa, and Akalana in Hawaii were the same as 
Taranga. Pua-kalana (the Kalana flower) would probably be the same in 
Hawaiian as Bua-taranga in the language of the Society Islands.

Ru, the supporter of the Heavens, married Buataranga, the guardian of the 
lower world. Their one child was Maui. The legends of Raro-Toaga state that 
Maui's father and mother were the children of Tangaroa (Kanaloa in 
Hawaiian), the great god worshiped throughout Polynesia. There were three 
Maui brothers and one sister, Ina-ika (Ina, the fish).

The New Zealand legends relate the incidents of the babyhood of Maui.

Maui was prematurely born, and his mother, not, caring to be troubled with 
him, cut off a lock of her hair, tied it around him and cast him into the 
sea. In this way the name came to him, Maui-Tiki-Tiki, or "Maui formed in 
the topknot." The waters bore him safely. The jelly fish enwrapped and 
mothered him. The god of the seas cared for and protected him. He was 
carried to the god's house and hung up in the roof that he inight feel the 
warm air of the fire, and be cherished into life. When he was old enough, he 
came to his relations while they were all gathered in the great House of 
Assembly, dancing and making merry. Little Maui crept in and sat down behind 
his brothers. Soon his mother called the children and found a strange child, 
who proved that he was her son, and was taken in as one of the family. Some 
of the brothers were jealous, but the eldest addressed the others as 
follows:

"Never mind; let him be our dear brother. In the days of peace remember the 
proverb, 'When you are on friendly terms, settle your disputes in a friendly 
way; when you are at war, you must redress your injuries by violence.' It is 
better for us, brothers, to be kind to other people. These are the ways by 
which men gain influence-by laboring for abundance of food to feed others, 
by collecting property to give to others, and by similar means by which you 
promote the good of others."

Thus, according to the New Zealand story related by Sir George Grey, Maui 
was received in his home.

Maui's home was placed by some of the Hawaiian myths at Kauiki, a foothill 
of the great extinct crater Haleakala, on the Island of Maui. It was here he 
lived when the sky was raised to its present position. Here was located the 
famous fort around which many battles were fought during the years 
immediately preceding the coming of Captain Cook. This fort was held by 
warriors of the Island of Hawaii a number of years. It was from this home 
that Maui was supposed to have journeyed when he climbed Mt. Haleakala to 
ensnare the sun.

And yet most of the Hawaiian legends place Maui's home by the rugged black 
lava beds of the Wailuku river near Hilo on the island Hawaii. Here he lived 
when he found the way to make fire by rubbing sticks together, and when he 
killed Kuna, the great eel, and performed other feats of valor. He was 
supposed to cultivate the land on the north side of the river. His mother, 
usually known as Hina, had her home in a lava cave under the beautiful 
Rainbow Falls, one of the fine scenic attractions of Hilo. An ancient 
demigod, wishing to destroy this home, threw a great mass of lava across the 
stream below the falls. The rising water was fast filling the cave.

Hina called loudly to her powerful son Maui. He came quickly and found that 
a large and strong ridge of lava lay across the stream. One end rested 
against a small hill. Maui struck the rock on the other side of the hill and 
thus broke a new pathway for the river. The water swiftly flowed away and 
the cave remained as the home of the Maui family.

According to the King Kalakaua family legend, translated by Queen 
Liliuokalani, Maui and his brothers also made this place their home. Here he 
aroused the anger of two uncles, his mother's brothers, who were called 
"Tall Post" and "Short Post," because they guarded the entrance to a cave in 
which the Maui family probably had its home.

"They fought hard with Maui, and were thrown, and red water flowed freely 
from Maui's forehead. This was the first shower by Maui." Perhaps some 
farmily discipline followed this knocking down of door posts, for it is 
said:

"They fetched the sacred Awa bush,
Then came the second shower by Maui;
The third shower was when the elbow of Awa was broken;
The fourth shower came with the sacred bamboo."

Maui's mother, so says a New Zealand legend, had her home in the under-world 
as well as with her children. Maui determined to find the hidden dwelling 
place. His mother would meet the children in the evening and lie down to 
sleep with them and then disappear with the first appearance of dawn. Maui 
remained awake one night, and when all were asleep, arose quietly and 
stopped up every crevice by which a ray of light could enter. The morning 
came and the sun mounted up-far up in the sky. At last his mother leaped up 
and tore away the things which shut out the light.

"Oh, dear; oh, dear! She saw the sun high in the heavens; so she hurried 
away, crying at the thought of having been so badly treated by her own 
children."

Maui watched her as she pulled up a tuft of grass and disappeared in the 
earth, pulling the grass back to its place.

Thus Maui found the path to the under-world. Soon he transformed himself 
into a pigeon and flew down, through the cave, until he saw a party of 
people under a sacred tree, like those growing in the ancient first Hawaii. 
He flew to the tree and threw down berries upon the people. They threw back 
stones. At last he permitted a stone from his father to strike him, and he 
fell to the ground. "They ran to catch him but lo! the pigeon had turned 
into a man."

Then his father "took him to the water to be baptized" (possibly a modern 
addition to the legend). Prayers were offered and ceremonies passed through. 
But the prayers were incomplete and Maui's father knew that the gods would 
be angry and cause Maui's death, and all because in the hurried baptism a 
part of the prayers had been left unsaid. Then Maui returned to the upper 
world and lived again with his brothers.

Maui commenced his mischievous life early, for Hervey Islanders say that one 
day the children were playing a game dearly loved by Polynesians- hide-and-
seek. Here a sister enters into the game and hides little Maui under a pile 
of dry sticks. His brothers could not find him, and the sister told them 
where to look. The sticks were carefully handled, but the child could not be 
found. He had shrunk himself so small that he was like an insect under some 
sticks and leaves. Thus early he began to use enchantments.

Maui's home, at the best, was only a sorry affair. Gods and demigods lived 
in caves and small grass houses. The thatch rapidly rotted and required 
continual renewal. In a very short time the heavy rains beat through the 
decaying roof. The home was without windows or doors, save as low openings 
in the ends or sides allowed entrance to those willing to crawl through. Off 
on one side would be the rude shelter, in the shadow of which Hma pounded 
the bark of certain trees into wood pulp and then into strips of thin, soft 
wood-paper, which bore the name of "Tapa cloth." This cloth Hina prepared 
for the clothing of Maui and his brothers. Tapa cloth was often treated to a 
coat of cocoa-nut, or candle-nut oil, making it somewhat waterproof and also 
more durable.

Here Maui lived on edible roots and fruits and raw fish, knowing little 
about cooked food, for the art of fire making was not yet known. In later 
years Maui was supposed to live on the eastern end of the island Maui, and 
also in another home on the large island Hawaii, on which he discovered how 
to make fire by rubbing dry sticks together. Maui was the Polynesian 
Mercury. As a little fellow he was endowed with peculiar powers, permitting 
him to become invisible or to change his human form into that of an animal. 
He was ready to take anything from any one by craft or force. Nevertheless, 
like the thefts of Mercury, his pranks usually benefited mankind.

It is a little curious that around the different homes of Maui, there is so 
little record of temples and priests and altars. He lived too far back for 
priestly customs. His story is the rude, mythical survival of the days when 
of church and civil government there was none and worship of the gods was 
practically unknown, but every man was a law unto himself, and also to the 
other man, and quick retaliation followed any injury received.

II.
MAUI THE FISHERMAN
"Oh the great fish hook of Maui!
Manai-i-ka-lani 'Made fast to the heavens' - its name;
An earth-twisted cord ties the hook.
Engulfed from the lofty Kauiki.
Its bait the red billed Alae,
The bird made sacred to Hina.
It sinks far down to Hawaii,
Struggling and painfully dying.
Caught is the land under the water,
Floated up, up to the surface,
But Hina hid a wing of the bird
And broke the land under the water.
Below, was the bait snatched away
And eaten at once -by the fishes,
The Ulua of the deep muddy places."

--Chant of Kualii, about A. D. 1700.

ONE of Maui's homes was near Kauiki, a place woll known throughout the 
Hawaiian Islands because of its strategic importance. For many years it was 
the site of a fort around which fierce battles were fought by the natives of 
the island Maui, repelling the invasions of their neighbors from Hawaii.

Haleakala (the House of the Sun), the mountain from which Maui the demi-god 
snared the sun, looks down ten thousand feet upon the Kauiki headland. 
Across the channel from Haleakala rises Mauna Kea, "The White Mountain"-the 
snow-capped-which almost all the year round rears its white head in majesty 
among the clouds.

In the snowy breakers of the surf which washes the beach below these 
mountains, are broken coral reefs-the fishing grounds of the Hawaiians. Here 
near Kauiki, according to some Hawaiian legends, Maui's mother Hina had her 
grass house and made and dried her kapa cloth. Even to the present day it is 
one of the few places in the islands where the kapa is still pounded into 
sheets from the bark of the hibiscus and kindred trees.

Here is a small bay partially reef-protected, over which year after year the 
moist clouds float and by day and by night crown the waters with rainbows-
the legendary sign of the home of the deified ones. Here when the tide is 
out the natives wade and swim, as they have done for centuries, from coral 
block to coral block, shunning the deep resting places of their dread enemy, 
the shark, sometimes esteemed divine. Out on the edge of the outermost reef 
they seek the shellfish which cling to the coral, or spear the large fish 
which have been left in the beautiful little lakes of the reef. Coral land 
is a region of the sea coast abounding in miniature lakes and rugged valleys 
and steep mountains. Clear waters with every motion of the tide surge in and 
out through sheltered caves and submarine tunnels, according to an ancient 
Hawaiian song-

"Never quiet, never failing, never sleeping,
Never very noisy is the sea of the sacred caves."

Sea mosses of many hues are the forests which drape the hillsides of coral 
land and reflect the colored rays of light which pierce the ceaselessly 
moving waves. Down in the beautiful little lakes, under overhanging coral 
cliffs, darting in and out through the fringes of seaweed, the purple mullet 
and royal red fish flash before the eyes of the fisherman. Sometimes the 
many-tinted glorious fish of paradise reveal their beauties, and then again 
a school of black and gold citizens of the reef follow the tidal waves 
around projecting crags and through the hidden tunnels from lake to lake, 
while above the fisherman follows spearing or snaring as best he can. Maui's 
brothers were better fishermen than he. They sought the deep sea beyond the 
reef and the larger fish. They made hooks of bone or of mother of pearl, 
with a straight, slender, sharp-pointed piece leaning backward at a sharp 
angle. This was usually a consecrated bit of bone or mother of pearl, and 
was supposed to have peculiar power to hold fast any fish which had taken 
the bait.

These bones were usually taken from the body of some one who while living 
had been noted for great power or high rank. This sharp piece was tightly 
tied to the larger bone or shell, which formed the shank of the hook. The 
sacred barb of Maui's hook was a part of the magic bone he had secured from 
his ancestors in the under-world-the bone with which he struck the sun while 
lassooing him and compelling him to move more slowly through the heavens.

"Earth-twisted"-fibres of vines-twisted while growing, was the cord used by 
Maui in tying the parts of his magic hook together.

Long and strong were the fish lines made from the olona fibre, holding the 
great fish caught from the depths of the ocean. The fibres of the olona vine 
were among the longest and strongest threads found in the Hawaiian Islands.

Such a hook could easily be cast loose by the struggling fish, if the least 
opportunity were given. Therefore it was absolutely necessary to keep the 
line taut, and pull strongly and steadily, to land the fish in the canoe.

Maui did not use his magic hook for a long time. He seemed to understand 
that it would not answer ordinary needs. Possibly the idea of making the 
supernatural hook did not occur to him until he had exhausted his lower wit 
and magic upon his brothers.

It is said that Maui was not a very good fisherman. Sometimes his end of the 
canoe contained fish which his brothers had thought were on their hooks 
until they were landed in the canoe.

Many times they laughed at him for his poor success, and he retaliated with 
his mischievous tricks.

"E!" he would cry, when one of his brothers began to pull in, while the 
other brothers swiftly paddled the canoe forward. "E!" See we both have 
caught great fish at the same moment. Be careful now. Your line is loose. 
Look out! Look out!"

All the time he would be pulling his own line in as rapidly as possible. 
Onward rushed the canoe. Each fisherman shouting to encourage the others. 
Soon the lines by the tricky manipulation of Maul would be crossed. Then as 
the great fish was brought near the side of the boat Maui the little, the 
mischievous one, would slip his hook toward the head of the fish and flip it 
over into the canoe-causing his brother's line to slacken for a moment. Then 
his mournful cry rang out: "Oh, my brother, your fish is gone. Why did you 
not pull more steadily? It was a fine fish, and now it is down deep in the 
waters." Then Maui held up his splendid catch (from his brother's hook) and 
received somewhat suspicious congratulations. But what could they do, Maui 
was the smart one of the family.

Their father and mother were both members of,the household of the gods. The 
father was "the supporter of the heavens" and the mother was the guardian of 
the way to the invisible world," but pitifully small and very few were the 
gifts bestowed upon their children. Maui's brothers knew nothing beyond the 
average home life of the ordinary Hawaiian, and Maui alone was endowed with 
the power to work miracles. Nevertheless the student of Polynesian legends 
learns that Maui is more widely known than almost all the demi-gods of all 
nations as a discoverer of benefits for his fellows, and these physical 
rather than spiritual. After many fishing excursions Maui's brothers seemed 
to have wit enough to understand his tricks, and thenceforth they refused to 
take him in their canoe when they paddled out to the deep-sea fishing 
grounds. Then those who depended upon Maui to supply their daily needs 
murmured against his poor success. His mother scolded him and his brothers 
ridiculed him.

In some of the Polynesian legends it is said that his wives and children 
complained because of his laziness and at last goaded him into a new effort.

The ex-Queen Liliuokalani, in a translation of what is called "the family 
chant," says that Maui's mother sent him to his father for a hook with which 
to supply her need.

"Go hence to your father,
'Tis there you find line and hook.
This is the hook-'Made fast to the heavens-'
'Manaia-ka-lani'-'tis called.
When the hook catches land
It brings the old seas together.
Bring hither the large Alae,
The bird of Hina.

When Maui had obtained his hook, he tried to go fishing with his brothers. 
He leaped on the end of their canoe as they pushed out into deep water. They 
were angry and cried out: "This boat is too small for another Maui." So they 
threw him off and made him swim back to the beach. When they returned from 
their day's work, they brought back only a shark. Maui told them if he had 
been with them better fish would have been upon their hooks-the Ulua, for 
instance, or, possibly, the Pimoe-the king of fish. At last they let him go 
far out outside the harbor of Kipahula to a place opposite Ka Iwi o Pele, 
"The bone of Pele," a peculiar piece of lava lying near the beach at Hana on 
the eastern side of the island Maui. There they fished,but only sharks were 
caught. The brothers ridiculed Maui, saying: "Where are the Ulua, and where 
is Pimoe?"

Then Maui threw his magic hook into the sea, baited with one of the Alae 
birds, sacred to his mother Hina. He used the incantation, "When I let go my 
hook with divine power, then I get the great Ulua."

The bottom of the sea began to move. Great waves arose, trying to carry the 
canoe away. The fish pulled the canoe two days, drawing the line to its 
fullest extent. When the slack began to come in the line, because of the 
tired fish, Maui called for the brothers to pull hard against the coming 
fish. Soon land rose out of the water. Maui told them not to look back or 
the fish would be lost. One brother did look back-the line slacked, snapped, 
and broke, and the land lay behind them in islands.

One of the Hawaiian legends also says that while the brothers were paddling 
in full strength, Maui saw a calabash floating in the water. He lifted it 
into the canoe, and behold! his beautiful sister Hina of the sea. The 
brothers looked, and the separated islands lay behind them, free from the 
hook, while Cocoanut Island-the dainty spot of beauty in Hilo harbor-was 
drawn up-a little edge of lava-in later years the home of a cocoanut grove.

The better, the more complete, legend comes from New Zealand, which makes 
Maui so mischievous that his brothers refuse his companionship-and 
therefore, thrown on his own resources, he studies how to make a hook which 
shall catch something worth while. In this legend Maui is represented as 
making his own hook and then pleading with his brothers to let him go with 
them once more. But they hardened their hearts against him, and refused 
again and again.

Maui possessed the power of changing himself into different forms. At one 
time while playing with his brothers he had concealed himself for them to 
find. They heard his voice in a corner of the house-but could not find him. 
Then under the mats on the floor, but again they could not find him. There 
was only an insect creeping on the floor. Suddenly they saw their little 
brother where the insect had been. Then they knew he had been tricky with 
them. So in these fishing days he resolved to go back to his old ways and 
cheat his brothers into carrying him with them to the great fishing grounds.

Sir George Gray says that the New Zealand Maui went out to the canoe and 
concealed himself as an insect in the bottom of the boat so that when the 
early morning light crept over the waters and his brothers pushed the canoe 
into the surf they could not see him. They rejoiced that Maui did not 
appear, and paddled away over the waters.

They fished all day and all night and on the morning of the next day, out 
from among the fish in the bottom of the boat came their troublesome 
brother.

They had caught many fine fish and were satisfied, so thought to paddle 
homeward, but their younger brother plead with them to go out, far out, to 
the deeper seas and permit him to cast his hook. He said he wanted larger 
and better fish than any they had captured.

So they paddled to their outermost fishing grounds -but this did not satisfy 
Maui-

"Farther out on the waters,
O! my brothers,
I seek the great fish of the sea."

It was evidently easier to work for him than to argue with him-therefore far 
out in the sea they went. The home land disappeared from view; they could 
see only the outstretching waste of waters. Maui urged them out still 
farther. Then he drew his magic hook from under his malo or loin-cloth. The 
brothers wondered what he would do for bait. The New Zealand legend says 
that he struck his nose a mighty blow until the blood gushed forth. When 
this blood became clotted, he fastened it upon his hook and let it down into 
the deep sea.

Down it went to the very bottom and caught the under world. It was a mighty 
fish-but the brothers paddled with all their might and main and Maui pulled 
in the line. It was hard rowing against the power which held the hook down 
in the sea depths-but the brothers became enthusiastic over Maui's large 
fish, and were generous in their strenuous endeavors. Every muscle was 
strained and every paddle held strongly against the sea that not an inch 
should be lost. There was no sudden leaping and darting to and fro, no 
"give" to the line; no "tremble" as when a great fish would shake itself in 
impotent wrath when held captive by a hook. It was simply a struggle of 
tense muscle against an immensely heavy dead weight. To the brothers there 
came slowly the feeling that Maui was in one of his strange moods and that 
something beyond their former experiences with their tricky brother was 
coming to pass.

At last one of the brothers glanced backward. With a scream of intense 
terror he dropped his paddle. The others also looked. Then each caught his 
paddle and with frantic exertion tried to force their canoe onward. Deep 
down in the heavy waters they pushed their paddles. Out of the great seas 
the black, ragged head of a large island was rising like a fish-it seemed to 
be chasing them, through the boiling surf. In a little while the water 
became shallow around them, and their canoe finally rested on a black beach.

Maui for some reason left his brothers, charging them not to attempt to cut 
up this great fish. But the unwise brothers thought they would fill the 
canoe with part of this strange thing which they had caught. They began to 
cut up the back and put huge slices into their canoe. But the great fish-the 
island-shook under the blows and with mighty earthquake shocks tossed the 
boat of the brothers, and their canoe was destroyed. As they were struggling 
in the waters, the great fish devoured them. The island came up more and 
more from the waters-but the deep gashes made by Maui's brothers did not 
heal-they became the mountains and valleys stretching from sea to sea.

White of New Zealand says that Maui went down into the underworld to meet 
his great ancestress, who was one side dead and one side alive. From the 
dead side he took the jaw bone, made a magic hook, and went fishing. When he 
let the hook down into the sea, he called:

"Take my bait. O Depths!
Confused you are. O Depths!
And coming upward."

Thus he pulled up Ao-tea-roa - one of the large islands of New Zealand. On 
it were houses, with people around them. Fires were burning. Maui walked 
over the island, saw with wonder the strange men and the mysterious fire. He 
took fire in his hands and was burned. He leaped into the sea, dived deep, 
came up with the other large island on his shoulders. This island he set on 
fire and left it always burning, It is said that the name for New Zealand 
given to Captain Cook was Te ika o Maui, "The fish of Maui." Some New 
Zealand natives say that he fished up the island on which dwelt "Great Hina 
of the Night," who finally destroyed Maui while he was seeking immortality.

One legend says that Maui fished up apparently from New Zealand the large 
island of the Tongas. He used this chant:

O Tonga-nui!
why art Thou
Sulkily biting, biting below!
Beneath the earth
The power is felt,
The foam is seen,
Coming.
O thou loved grandchild
Of Tangaro a-meha. "

This is an excellent poetical description of the great fish delaying the 
quick hard bite. Then the island comes to the surface and Maui, the beloved 
grandchild of the Polynesian god Kanaloa, is praised.

It was part of one of the legends that Maui changed himself into a bird and 
from the heavens let down a line with which he drew up land, but the line 
broke, leaving islands rather than a mainland. About two hundred lesser gods 
went to the new islands in a large canoe. The greater gods punished them by 
making them mortal.

Turner, in his book on Samoa, says there were three Mauis, all brothers. 
They went out fishing from Rarotonga. One of the brothers begged the 
"goddess of the deep rocks" to let his hooks catch land. Then the island 
Manahiki was drawn up. A great wave washed two of the Mauis away. The other 
Maui found a great house in which eight hundred gods lived. Here he made his 
home until a chief from Rarotonga drove him away. He fled into the sky, but 
as he leaped he separated the land into two islands.

Other legends of Samoa say that Tangaroa, the great god, rolled stones from 
heaven. One became the island Savaii, the other became Upolu. A god is 
sometimes represented as passing over the ocean with a bag of sand. Wherever 
he dropped a little sand islands sprang up.

Payton, the earnest and honored missionary of the New Hebrides Islands, 
evidently did not know the name Mauitikitiki, so he spells the name of the 
fisherman Ma-tshi-ktshi-ki, and gives the myth of the fishing up of the 
various islands. The natives said that Maui left footprints on the coral 
reefs of each island where he stood straining and lifting in his endeavors 
to pull up each other island. He threw his line around a large island 
intending to draw it up and unite it with the one on which he stood, but his 
line broke. Then he became angry and divided into two parts the island on 
which he stood. This same Maui is recorded by Mr. Payton as being in a flood 
which put out one volcano-Maui seized another, sailed across to a 
neighboring island and piled it upon the top of the volcano there, so the 
fire was placed out of reach of the flood.

In the Hervey Group of the Tahitian or Society Islands the same story 
prevails and the natives point out the place where the hook caught and a 
print was made by the foot in the coral reef. But they add some very 
mythical details. Maui's magic fish hook is thrown into the skies, where it 
continuously hangs, the curved tail of the constellation which we call 
Scorpio. Then one of the gods becoming angry with Maui seized him and threw 
him also among the stars. There he stays looking down upon his people. He 
has become a fixed part of the scorpion itself.

The Hawaiian myths sometimes represent Maui as trying to draw the islands 
together while fishing them out of the sea. When they had pulled up the 
island of Kauai they looked back and were frightened. They evidently tried 
to rush away from the new monster and thus broke the line. Maui tore a side 
out of the small crater Kaula when trying to draw it to one of the other 
islands. Three aumakuas, three fishes supposed to be spirit-gods, guarded 
Kaula and defeated his purpose. At Hawaii Cocoanut Island broke off because 
Maui pulled too hard. Another place near Hilo on the large island of Hawaii 
where the hook was said to have caught is in the Wailuku river below Rainbow 
Falls.

Maui went out from his home at Kauiki, fishing with his brothers. After they 
had caught some fine fish the brothers desired to return, but Maui persuaded 
them to go out farther. Then when they became tired and determined to go 
back, he made the seas stretch out and the shores recede until they could 
see no land. Then drawing the magic hook, he baited it with the Alae or 
sacred mud hen belonging to his Mother Hina. Queen Liliuokalani's family 
chant has the following reference to this myth:

"Maui longed for fish for Hina-akeahi (Hina of the fire, his mother),
Go hence to your father,
There you will find line and hook.
Manaiakalani is the book.
Where the islands are caught,
The ancient seas are connected. The great bird Alae is taken, The sister 
bird, Of that one of the hidden fire of Maui."

Maui evidently had no scruples against using anything which would help him 
carry out his schemes.

He indiscriminately robbed his friends and the gods alike.

Down in the deep sea sank the hook with its struggling bait, until it was 
seized by "the land under the water."

But Hina the mother saw the struggle of her sacred bird and hastened to the 
rescue. She caught a wing of the bird, but could not pull the Alae from the 
sacred hook. The wing was torn off. Then the fish gathered around the bait 
and tore it in pieces. If the bait could have been kept entire, then the 
land would have come up in a continent rather than as an island. Then the 
Hawaiian group would have been unbroken. But the bait broke-and the islands 
came as fragments from the under world.

Maui's hook and canoe are frequently mentioned in the legends. The Hawaiians 
have a long rock in the Wailuku river at Hilo which they call Maui's canoe. 
Different names were given to Maui's canoe by the Maoris of New Zealand. 
"Vine of Heaven," "Prepare for the North," "Land of the Receding Sea." His 
fish hook bore the name "Plume of Beauty."

On the southern end of Hawke's Bay, New Zealand, there is a curved ledge of 
rocks extending out from, the coast. This is still called by the Maoris 
"Maui's fish-hook," as if the magic hook had been so firmly caught in the 
jaws of the island that Maui could not disentangle it, but had been 
compelled to cut it off from his line.

There is a large stone on the sea coast of North Kohala on the island of 
Hawaii which the Hawaiians point out as the place where Maui's magic hook 
caught the island and pulled it through the sea.

In the Tonga Islands, a place known as Hounga is pointed out by the natives 
as the spot where the magic hook canght in the rocks. The hook itself was 
said to have been in the possession of a chief-family for many generations.

Another group of Hawaiian legends, very incomplete, probably referring to 
Maui, but ascribed to other names, relates that a fisherman caught a large 
block of coral. He took it to his priest. After sacrificing, and consulting 
the gods, the priest advised the fisherman to throw the coral back into the 
sea with incantations. While so doing this block became Hawaii-loa. The 
fishing continued and blocks of coral were caught and thrown back into the 
sea until all the islands appeared. Hints of this legend cling to other 
island groups as well as to the Hawaiian Islands. Fornander credits a 
fisherman from foreign lands as thus bringing forth the Hawaiian Islands 
from the deep seas. The reference occurs in part of a chant known as that of 
a friend of Paao-the priest who is supposed to have come from, Samoa to 
Hawaii in the eleventh century. This priest calls for his companions:

"Here are the canoes. Get aboard.
Come along, and dwell on Hawaii with the green back.
A land which was found in the ocean,
A land thrown up from the sea-
From the very depths of Kanaloa,
The white coral, in the watery caves,
That was caught on the hook of the fisherman."

The god Kanaloa is sometimes known as a ruler of the under-world, whose land 
was caught by Maui's hook and brought up in islands. Thus in the legends the 
thought has been perpetuated that some one of the ancestors of the 
Polynesians made voyages and discovered islands.

In the time of Umi, King of Hawaii, there is the following record of an 
immense bone fish-hook, which was called the "fish-hook of Maui:"

"In the night of Mukti (the last night of the month), a priest and his 
servants took a man, killed him, and fastened his body to the hook, which 
bore the name Manai-a-ka-lani, and dragged it to the heiau (temple) as a 
'fish,' and placed it on the altar."

This hook was kept until the time of Kamehamleha I. From time to time he 
tried to break it, and pulled until he perspired.

Peapea, a brother of Kaahumanu, took the hook and broke it. He was afraid 
that Kamehameha would kill him. Kaahumanu, however, soothed the King, and he 
passed the matter over. The broken bone was probably thrown away.

III.
MAUI LIFTING THE SKY.
MAUI'S home was for a long time enveloped by darkness. The heavens had 
fallen down, or, rather, had not been separated from the earth.

According to some legends, the skies pressed so closely and so heavily upon 
the earth that when the plants began to grow, all the leaves were 
necessarily flat. According to other legends, the plants had to push up the 
clouds a little, and thus caused the leaves to flatten out into larger 
surface, so that they could better drive the skies back and hold them in 
place. Thus the leaves became flat at first, and have so remained through 
all the days of mankind. The plants lifted the sky inch by inch until men 
were able to crawl about between the heavens and the earth, and thus pass 
from place to place and visit one another.

After a long time, according to the Hawaiian legends, a man, supposed to be 
Maui, came to a woman and said: "Give me a drink from your gourd calabash, 
and I will push the heavens higher." The woman handed the gourd to him. When 
he had taken a deep draught, he braced himself against the clouds and lifted 
them to the height of the trees. Again he hoisted the sky and carried it to 
the tops of the mountains; then with great exertion he thrust it upwards 
once more, and pressed it to the place it now occupies. Nevertheless dark 
clouds many times hang low along the eastern slope of Maui's great mountain-
Haleakala-and descend in heavy rains upon the hill Kauwiki; but they clare 
not stay, lest Maui the strong come and hurl them so far away that they 
cannot come back again.

A man who had been watching the process of lifting the sky ridiculed Maui 
for attempting such a difficult task. When the clouds rested on the tops of 
the mountains, Maui turned to punish his critic. The man had fled to the 
other side of the island, Maui rapidly pursued and finally caught him on the 
sea coast, not many miles north of the town now known as Lahaina. After a 
brief struggle the man was changed, according to the story, into a great 
black rock, which can be seen by any traveler who desires to localize the 
legends of Hawaii.

In Samoa Tiitii, the latter part of the full name of Mauikiikii, is used as 
the name of the one who braced his feet against the rocks and pushed the sky 
up. The foot-prints, some six feet long, are said to be shown by the 
natives.

Another Samoan story is almost like the raw Hawaiian legend. The heavens had 
fallen, people crawled, but the leaves pushed up a little; but the sky was 
uneven. Men tried to walk, but hit their heads, and in this confined space 
it was very hot. A woman rewarded a man who lifted the sky to its proper 
place by giving him a drink of water from her cocoanut shell.

A number of small groups of islands in the Pacific have legends of their 
skies being lifted, but they attribute the labor to the great eels and 
serpents of the sea.

One of the Ellice group, Niu Island, says that as the serpent began to lift 
the sky the people clapped their hands and shouted "Lift up!" "High!" 
"Higher!" But the body of the serpent finally broke into pieces which became 
islands, and the blood sprinkled its drops on the sky and became stars.

One of the Samoan legends says that a plant called daiga, which had one 
large umbrella-like leaf, pushed up the sky and gave it its shape.

The Vatupu, or Tracey Islanders, said at one time the sky and rocks were 
united. Then steam or clouds of smoke rose from the rocks, and, pouring out 
in volumes, forced the sky away from the earth. Man appeared in these clouds 
of steam or smoke. Perspiration burst forth as this man forced his way 
through the heated atmosphere. From this perspiration woman was formed. Then 
were born three sons, two of whom pushed up the sky. One, in the north, 
pushed as far as his arms would reach. The one in the south was short and 
climbed a hill, pushing as he went up, until the sky was in its proper 
place.

The Gilbert Islanders say the sky was pushed up by men with long poles.

The ancient New Zealanders understood incantations by which they could draw 
up or discover. They found a land where the sky and the earth were united. 
They prayed over their stone axe and cut the sky and land apart. "Hau-hau-
tu" was the name of the great stone axe by which the sinews of the great 
heaven above were severed, and Langi (sky) was separated from, Papa (earth).

The New Zealand Maoris were accustomed to say that at first the sky rested 
close upon the earth and therefore there was utter darkness for ages. Then 
the six sons of heaven and earth, born during this period of darkness, felt 
the need of light and discussed the necessity of separating their parents-
the sky from the earth-and decided to attempt the work.

Rongo (Hawaiian god Lono) the "father of food plants," attempted to lift the 
sky, but could not tear it from the earth. Then Tangaroa (Kanaloa), the 
"father of fish and reptiles," failed. Haumia Tiki-tiki (Maui Kiikii), the 
"father of wild food plants," could not raise the clouds. Then Tu (Hawaiian 
Ku), the "father of fierce men," struggled in vain, But Tane (Hawaiian 
Kane), the "father of giant forests," pushed and lifted until he thrust the 
sky far up above him. Then they discovered their descendants-the multitude 
of human beings who had been living on the earth concealed and crushed by 
the clouds. Afterwards the last son, Tawhiri (father of storms), was angry 
and waged war against his brothers. He hid in the sheltered hollows of the 
great skies. There he begot his vast brood of winds and storms with which he 
finally drove all his brothers and their descendants into hiding places on 
land and sea. The New Zealanders mention the names of the canoes in which 
their ancestors fled from the old home Hawaiki.

Tu (father of fierce men) and his descendants, however, conquered wind and 
storm and have ever since held supremacy.

The New Zealand legends also say that heaven and earth have never lost their 
love for each other. -"The warm sighs of earth ever ascend from the wooded 
mountains and valleys, and men call them mists. The sky also lets fall 
frequent tears which men term dew drops."

The Manihiki islanders say that Maui desired to separate the sky from the 
earth. His father, Ru, was the supporter of the heavens. Maui persuaded him 
to assist in lifting the burden. Maui went to the north and crept into a 
place, where, lying prostrate under the sky, he could brace himself against 
it and push with great power. in the same way Ru went to the south and 
braced himself against the southern skies. Then they made the signal, and 
both pressed "with their backs against the solid blue mass." It gave way 
before the great strength of the father and son. Then they lifted again, 
bracing themselves with hands and knees against the earth. They crowded it 
and bent it upward. They were able to stand with the sky resting on their 
shoulders. They heaved against the bending mass, and it receded rapidly. 
They quickly put the palms of their hands under it; then the tips of their 
fingers, and it retreated farther and farther. At last, "drawing themselves 
out to gigantic proportions, they pushed the entire heavens up to the very 
lofty position which they have ever since occupied."

But Maui and Ru had not worked perfectly together; therefore the sky was 
twisted and its surface was very irregular. They determined to smooth the 
sky before they finished their task, so they took large stone adzes and 
chipped off the rough protuberances and ridges, until by and by the great 
arch was cut out and smoothed off. They then took finer tools and chipped 
and polished until the sky became the beautifully finished blue dome which 
now bends around the earth.

The Hervey island myth, as related by W. W. Gill, states that Ru, the father 
of Maui, came from Avaiki (Hawa-iki), the underworld or abode of the spirits 
of the dead. He found men crowded down by the sky, which was a mass of solid 
blue stone. He was very sorry when he saw the condition of the inhabitants 
of the earth, and planned to raise the sky a little. So he planted stakes of 
different kinds of trees. These were strong enough to hold the sky so far 
above the earth "that men could stand erect and walk about without 
inconvenience." This was celebrated in one of the Hervey Island songs:

"Force up the heavens,
O, Ru!
And let the space be clear."

For this helpful deed Ru received the name "The supporter of the heavens." 
He was rather proud of his achievement and was gratified because of the 
praise received. So he came sometimes and looked at the stakes and the 
beautiful blue sky resting on them. Maui, the son, came along and ridiculed 
his father for thinking so much of his work. Maui is not represented, in the 
legends, as possessing a great deal of love and reverence for his relatives 
provided his affection interfered with his mischief; so it was not at all 
strange that he laughed at his father. Ru became angry and said to Maui: 
"Who told youngsters to talk? Take care of yourself, or I will hurl you out 
of existence."

Maui dared him to try it. Ru quickly seized him and "threw him to a great 
height." But Maui changed himself to a bird and sank back to earth unharmed.

Then he changed himself back into the form of a man, and, making himself 
very large, ran and thrust his head between the old man's legs. He pried and 
lifted until Ru and the sky around him began to give. Another lift and he 
hurled them both to such a height that the sky could not come back.

Ru himself was entangled among the stars. His head and shoulders stuck fast, 
and he could not free himself. How he struggled, until the skies shook, 
while Maui went away. Maui was proud of his achievement in having moved the 
sky so far away. In this self-rejoicing he quickly forgot his father.

Ru died after a time. "His body rotted away and his bones, of vast 
proportions, came tumbling down from time to time, and were shivered on the 
earth into countless fragments. These shattered bones of Ru are scattered 
over every hill and valley of one of the islands, to the very edge of the 
sea."

Thus the natives of the Hervey Islands account for the many pieces of porous 
lava and the small pieces of pumice stone found occasionally in their 
islands. The "bones" were very light and greatly resembled fragments of real 
bone. If the fragments were large enough they were sometimes taken and 
worshiped as gods. One of these pieces, of extraordinary size, was given to 
Mr. Gill when the natives were bringing in a large collection of idols. 
"This one was known as 'The Light Stone,' and was worshiped as the god of 
the wind and the waves. Upon occasions of a hurricane, incantations and 
offerings of food would be made to it."

Thus, according to different Polynesian legends, Maui raised the sky and 
made the earth inhabitable for his fellow-men.

IV.
MAUI SNARING THE SUN.
"Maui became restless and fought the sun
With a noose that he laid.
And winter won the sun,
And summer was won by Maui."

-Queen Liliuokalani's family chant.

A VERY unique legend is found among the widely-scattered Polynesians. The 
story of Maui's "Snaring the Sun" was told among the Maoris of New Zealand, 
the Kanakas of the Hervey and Society Islands, and the ancient natives of 
Hawaii. The Samoans tell the same story without mentioning the name of Maui. 
They say that the snare was cast by a child of the sun itself.

The Polynesian stories of the origin of the sun are worthy of note before 
the le end of the change from short to long days is given.

The Tongan Islanders, according to W. W. Gill, tell the story of the origin 
of the sun and moon. They say that Vatea (Wakea) and their ancestor Tongaiti 
quarreled concerning a child-each claiming it as his own. In the struggle 
the child was cut in two. Vatea squeezed and rolled the part he secured into 
a ball and threw it away, far up into the heavens, where it became the sun. 
It shone brightly as it rolled along the heavens, and sank down to Avaiki 
(Hawaii), the nether world. But the ball came back again and once more 
rolled across the sky. Tonga-iti had let his half of the child fall on the 
ground and lie there, until made envious by the beautiful ball Vatea made.

At last he took the flesh which lay on the ground and made it into a ball. 
As the sun sank he threw his ball up into the darkness, and it rolled along 
the heavens, but the blood had drained out of the flesh while it lay upon 
the ground, therefore it could not become so red and burning as the sun, and 
had not life to move so swiftly. It was as white as a dead body, because its 
blood was all gone; and it could not make the darkness flee away as the sun 
had done. Thus day and night and the sun and moon always remain with the 
earth.

The legends of the Society Islands say that a demon in the west became angry 
with the sun and in his rage ate it up, causing night. In the same way a 
demon from the east would devour the moon, but for some reason these angry 
ones could not destroy their captives and were compelled to open their 
mouths and let the bright balls come forth once more. In some places a 
sacrifice of some one of distinction was needed to placate the wrath of the 
devourers and free the balls of light in times of eclipse.

The moon, pale and dead in appearance, moved slowly; while the sun, full of 
life and strength, moved quickly. Thus days were very short and nights were 
very long. Mankind suffered from the fierceness of the heat of the sun and 
also from its prolonged absence. Day and night were alike a burden to men. 
The darkness was so great and lasted so long that fruits would not ripen.

After Maui had succeeded in throwing the heavens into their place, and 
fastening them so that they could not fall, he learned that he had opened a 
way for the sun-god to come up from the lower world and rapidly run across 
the blue vault. This made two troubles for men-the heat of the sun was very 
great and the journey too quickly over. Maui planned to capture the sun and 
punish him for thinking so little about the welfare of mankind.

As Rev. A. O. Forbes, a missionary among the Hawaiians, relates, Maui's 
mother was troubled very much by the heedless haste of the sun. She had many 
kapa-cloths to make, for this was the only kind of clothing known in Hawaii, 
except sometimes a woven mat or a long grass fringe worn as a skirt. This 
native cloth was made by pounding the fine bark of certain trees with wooden 
mallets until the fibres were beaten and ground into a wood pulp. Then she 
pounded the pulp into thin sheets from which the best sleeping mats and 
clothes could be fashioned. These kapa cloths had to be thoroughly dried, 
but the days were so short that by the time she had spread out the kapa the 
sun had heedlessly rushed across the sky and gone down into the under-world, 
and all the cloth had to be gathered up again and cared for until another 
day should come. There were other troubles. "The food could not be prepared 
and cooked in one day. Even an incantation to the gods could not be chanted 
through ere theywere overtaken by darkness."

This was very discouraging and caused great suffering, as well as much 
unnecessary trouble and labor. Many complaints were made against the 
thoughtless sun.

Maui pitied his mother and determined to make the sun go slower that the 
days might be long enough to satisfy the needs of men. Therefore, he went 
over to the northwest of the island on which he lived. This was Mt. Iao, an 
extinct volcano, in which lies one of the most beautiful and picturesque 
valleys of the Hawaiian Islands. He climbed the ridges until he could see 
the course of the sun as it passed over the island. He saw that the sun came 
up the eastern side of Mt. Haleakala. He crossed over the plain between the 
two mountains and climbed to the top of Mt. Haleakala. There he watched the 
burning sun as it came up from Koolau and passed directly over the top of 
the mountain. The summit of Haleakala is a great extinct crater twenty miles 
in circumference, and nearly twenty-five hundred feet in depth. There are 
two tremendous gaps or chasms in the side of the crater wall, through which 
in days gone by the massive bowl poured forth its flowing lava. One of these 
was the Koolau, or eastern gap, in which Maui probably planned to catch the 
sun.

Mt. Hale-a-ka-la of the Hawaiian Islands means House-of-the-sun. "La," or 
"Ra," is the name of the sun throughout parts of Polynesia. Ra was the 
sungod of ancient Egypt. Thus the antiquities of Polynesia and Egypt touch 
each other, and today no man knows the full reason thereof.

The Hawaiian legend says Maui was taunted by a man who ridiculed the idea 
that he could snare the sun, saying, "You will never catch the sun. You are 
only an idle nobody."

Maui replied, "When I conquer my enemy and my desire is attained, I will be 
your death."

After studying the path of the sun, Maui returned to his mother and told her 
that he would go and cut off the legs of the sun so that he could not run so 
fast.

His mother said: "Are you strong enough for this work?" He said, 'Yes." Then 
she gave him fifteen strands of well-twisted fiber and told him to go to his 
grandmother, who lived in the great crater of Haleakala, for the rest of the 
things in his conflict with the sun. She said: "You must climb the mountain 
to the place where a large wiliwili tree is standing. There you will find 
the place where the sun stops to eat cooked bananas prepared by your 
grandmother.

Stay there until a rooster crows three times; then watch your grandmother go 
out to make a fire and put on food. You had better take her bananas. She 
will look for them and find you and ask who you are. Tell her you belong to 
Hina."

When she had taught him all these things, he went tip the mountain to Kaupo 
to the place Hina had directed. There was a large wiliwili tree. Here he 
waited for the rooster to crow. The name of that rooster was Kalauhele-moa. 
When the rooster had crowed three times, the grandmother came out with a 
bunch of bananas to cook for the sun. She took off the upper part of the 
bunch and laid it down. Maui immediately snatched it away. In a moment she 
turned to pick it up, but could not find it. She was angry and cried out: 
"Where are the bananas of the sun?" Then she took off another part of the 
bunch, and Maui stole that. Thus he did until all the bunch had been taken 
away. She was almost blind and could not detect him by sight, so she sniffed 
all around her until she detected the smell of a man. She asked - "Who are 
you? To whom do you belong?" Maui replied: "I belong to Hina." "Why have you 
come?" Maui told her, "I have come to kill the sun. He goes so fast that he 
never dries the tapa Hina has beaten out."

The old woman gave a magic stone for a battle axe and one more rope. She 
taught him how to catch the sun, saying: "Make a place to hide here by this 
large wiliwili tree. When the first leg of the sun comes up, catch it with 
your first rope, and so on until you have used all your ropes. Fasten them 
to the tree, then take the stone axe to strike the body of the sun."

Maui dug a hole among the roots of the tree and concealed himself. Soon the 
first ray of light-the first leg of the sun-came up along the mountain side. 
Maui threw his rope and caught it. One by one the legs of the sun came over 
the edge of the crater's rim and were caught. Only one long leg was still 
hanging down the side of the mountain. It was hard for the sun to move that 
leg. It shook and trembled and tried hard to come up. At last it crept over 
the edge and was caught by Maui with the rope given by his grandmother.

When the sun saw that his sixteen long legs were held fast in the ropes, he 
began to go back down the mountain side into the sea. Then Maui tied the 
ropes fast to the tree and pulled until the body of the sun came up again. 
Brave Maui caught his magic stone club or axe, and began to strike and wound 
the sun, until he cried: "Give me my life." Maui said: "If you live, you may 
be a traitor. Perhaps I had better kill you." But the sun begged for life. 
After they had conversed a while, they agreed that there should be a regular 
motion in the journey of the sun. There should be longer days, and. yet half 
the time he might go quickly as in the winter time, but the other half he 
must move slowly as in summer. Thus men dwelling on the earth should be 
blessed.

Another legend says that he made a lasso and climbed to the summit of Mt. 
Haleakala. He made ready his lasso, so that when the sun came lip the 
mountain side and rose above him he could cast the noose and catch the sun, 
but he only snared one of the sun's larger rays and broke it off. Again and 
again he threw the lasso until he had broken off all the strong rays of the 
sun.

Then he shouted exultantly, "Thou art my captive; I will kill thee for going 
so swiftly."

Then the sun said, "Let me live and thou shalt see me go more slowly 
hereafter. Behold, hast thou not broken off all my strong legs and left me 
only the weak ones?"

So the agreement was made, and Maui permitted the sun to pursue his course, 
and from that day he went more slowly.

Maui returned from his conflict with the sun and sought for Moemoe, the man 
who had ridiculed him. Maui chased this man around the island from one side 
to the other until they had passed through Lahaina (one of the first mission 
stations in 1828). There on the seashore near the large black rock of the 
legend of Maui lifting the sky he found Moemoe. Then they left the seashore 
and the contest raged up hill and down until Maui slew the man and "changed 
the body into a long rock, which is there to this day, by the side of the 
road going past Black Rock."

Before the battle with the sun occurred Maui went down into the underworld, 
according to the New Zealand tradition, and remained a long time with his 
relatives. In some way he learned that there was an enchanted jawbone in the 
possession of some one of his ancestors, so he waited and waited, hoping 
that at last he might discover it.

After a time he noticed that presents of food were being sent away to some 
person whom he had not met.

One day he asked the messengers, "Who is it you are taking that present of 
food to?"

The people answered, "It is for Muri, your ancestress."

Then he asked for the food, saying, "I will carry it to her myself."

But he took the food away and hid it. "And this he did for many days," and 
the presents failed to reach the old woman.

By and by she suspected mischief, for it did not seem as if her friends 
would neglect her so long a time, so she thought she would catch the tricky 
one and eat him. She depended upon her sense of smell to detect the one who 
had troubled her. As Sir George Grey tells the story: "When Maui came along 
the path carrying the present of food, the old chiefess sniffed and sniffed 
until she was sure that she smelt some one coming. She was very much 
exasperated, and her stomach began to distend itself that she might be ready 
to devour this one when he came near.

Then she turned toward the south and sniffed. and not a scent of anything 
reached her. Then she turned to the north, and to the cast, but could not 
detect the odor of a human being. She made one more trial and turned toward 
the west. Ah! then came the scent of a man to her plainly and she called 
out, 'I know, from the smell wafted to me by the breeze, that somebody is 
close to me.'"

Maui made known his presence and the old woman knew that he was a descendant 
of hers, and her stomach began immediately to shrink and contract itself 
again.

Then she asked, "Art thou Maui?"

He answered, "Even so," and told her that he wanted "the jaw-bone by which 
great enchantments could be wrought."

Then Muri, the old chiefess, gave him the magic bone and he returned to his 
brothers, who were still living on the earth.

Then Maui said: "Let us now catch the sun in a noose that we may compel him 
to move more slowly in order that mankind may have long days to labor in and 
procure subsistence for themselves."

They replied, "No man can approach it on account of the fierceness of the 
heat."

According to the Society Island legend, his mother advised him to have 
nothing to do with the sun, who was a divine living creature, "in form like 
a man, possessed of fearful energy," shaking his golden locks both morning 
and evening in the eyes of men. Many persons had tried to regulate the 
movements of the sun, but had failed completely.

But Maui encouraged his mother and his brothers by asking them to remember 
his power to protect himself by the use of enchantments.

The Hawaiian legend says that Maui himself gathered cocoanut fibre in great 
quantity and manufactured it into strong ropes. But the legends of other 
islands say that he had the aid of his brothers, and while working learned 
many useful lessons. While winding and twisting they discovered how to make 
square ropes and flat ropes as well as the ordinary round rope. In the 
Society Islands, it is said, Maui and his brothers made six strong ropes of 
great length. These he called aeiariki (royal nooses).

The New Zealand legend says that when Maui and his brothers had finished 
making all the ropes required they took provisions and other things needed 
and journeyed toward the east to find the place where the sun should rise. 
Maui carried with him the magic jaw-bone which he had secured from Muri, his 
ancestress, in the under-world.

They traveled all night and concealed themselves by day so that the sun 
should not see them and become too suspicious and watchful. In this way they 
journeyed, until "at length they had gone very far to the eastward and had 
come to the very edge of the place out of which the sun rises. There they 
set to work and built on each side a long, high wall of clay, with hilts of 
boughs of trees at each end to hide themselves in."

Here they laid a large noose made from their ropes and Maui concealed 
himself on one side of this place along which the sun must come, while his 
brothers hid on the other side.

Maui seized his magic enchanted jaw-bone as the weapon with which to fight 
the sun, and ordered his brothers to pull hard on the noose and not to be 
frightened or moved to set the sun free.

"At last the sun came rising up out of his place like a fire spreading far 
and wide over the mountains and forests.

He rises up.

His head passes through the noose.

The ropes are pulled tight.

Then the monster began to struggle and roll himself about, while the snare 
jerked backwards and forwards as he struggled. Ah! was not he held fast in 
the ropes of his enemies.

Then forth rushed that bold hero Maui with his enchanted weapon. The sun 
screamed aloud and roared. Maui struck him fiercely with many blows. They 
held him for a long time. At last they let him go, and then weak from wounds 
the sun crept very slowly and feebly along his course."

In this way the days were made longer so that men could perform their daily 
tasks and fruits and food plants could have time to grow.

The legend of the Hervey group of islands says that Maui made six snares and 
placed them at intervals along the path over which the sun must pass. The 
sun in the form of a man climbed up from Avaiki (Hawaiki). Maui pulled the 
first noose, but it slipped down the rising sun until it caught and was 
pulled tight around his feet.

Maui ran quickly to pull the ropes of the second snare, but that also 
slipped down, down, until it was tightened around the knees. Then Maui 
hastened to the third snare, while the sun was trying to rush along on his 
journey. The third snare caught around the hips. The fourth snare fastened 
itself around the waist. The fifth slipped under the arms, and yet the sun 
sped along as if but little inconvenienced by Maui's efforts.

Then Maui caught the last noose and threw it around the neck of the sun, and 
fastened the rope to a spur of rock. The sun struggled until nearly 
strangled to death and then gave up, promising Maui that he would go as 
slowly as was desired. Maui left the snares fastened to the sun to keep him 
in constant fear.

"These ropes may still be seen hanging from the sun at dawn and stretching 
into the skies when he descends into the ocean at night. By the assistance 
of these ropes he is gently let down into Ava-iki in the evening, and also 
raised up out of shadow-land in the morning."

Another legend from the Society Islands is related by Mr. Gill:

Maui tried many snares before he could catch the sun. The sun was the 
Hercules, or the Samson, of the heavens. He broke the strong cords of 
cocoanut fibre which Maui made and placed around the opening by which the 
sun climbed out from the under-world. Maui made stronger ropes, but still 
the sun broke them every one.

Then Maui thought of his sister's hair, the sister Inaika, whom he cruelly 
treated in later years. Her hair was long and beautiful. He cut off some of 
it and made a strong rope. With this he lassoed or rather snared the sun, 
and caught him around the throat. The sun quickly promised to be more 
thoughtful of the needs of men and go at a more reasonable pace across the 
sky.

A story from the American Indians is told in Hawaii's Young People, which is 
very similar to the Polynesian legends.

An Indian boy became very angry with the sun for getting so warm and making 
his clothes shrink with the heat. He told his sister to make a snare. The 
girl took sinews from a large deer, but they shriveled under the heat. She 
took her own long hair and made snares, but they were burned in a moment. 
Then she tried the fibres of various plants and was successful. Her brother 
took the fibre cord and drew it through his lips. It stretched and became a 
strong red cord. He pulled and it became very long. He went to the place of 
sunrise, fixed his snare, and caught the sun. When the sun had been 
sufficiently punished, the animals of the earth studied the problem of 
setting the sun free. At last a mouse as large as a mountain ran and gnawed 
the red cord. It broke and the sun moved on, but the poor mouse had been 
burned and shriveled into the small mouse of the present day.

A Samoan legend says that a woman living for a tinie with the sun bore a 
child who had the name "Child of the Sun." She wanted gifts for the child's 
marriage, so she took a long vine, climbed a tree, made the vine into a 
noose, lassoed the sun, and made him give her a basket of blessings.

In Fiji, the natives tie the grasses growing on a hilltop over which they 
are passing, when traveling from place to place. They do this to make a 
snare to catch the sun if he should try to go down before they reach the end 
of their day's journey.

This legend is a misty memory of some time when the Polynesian people were 
in contact with the short days of the extreme north or south. It is a very 
remarkable exposition of a fact of nature perpetuated many centuries in 
lands absolutely free from such natural phenomena.

V.
MAUI FINDING FIRE.
"Grant, oh grant me thy hidden fire,
O Banyan Tree.
Perform an incantation,
Utter a prayer
To the Banyan Tree.
Kindle a fire in the dust
Of the Banyan Tree."

-Translation of ancient Polynesian chant.

AMONG students of mythology certain characters in the legends of the various 
nations are known as "culture heroes." Mankind has from time to time learned 
exceedingly useful lessons and has also usually ascribed the new knowledge 
to some noted person in the national mythology. These mythical benefactors 
who have brought these practical benefits to men are placed among the "hero 
gods." They have been teachers or "culture heroes" to mankind.

Probably the fire finders of the different nations are among the best 
remembered of all these benefactors. This would naturally be the case, for 
no greater good has touched man's physical life than the discovery of 
methods of making fire.

Prometheus, the classical fire finder, is most widely known in literature. 
But of all the helpful gods of mythology, Maui, the mischievous Polynesian, 
is beyond question the hero of the largest numbers of nations scattered over 
the widest extent of territory. Prometheus belonged to Rome, but Maui 
belonged to the length and breadth of the Pacific Ocean. Theft or trickery, 
the use of deceit of some kind, is almost inseparably connected with fire 
finding all over the world. Prometheus stole fire from, Jupiter and gave it 
to men together with the genius to make use of it in the arts and sciences. 
He found the rolling chariot of the sun, secretly filled his hollow staff 
with fire, carried it to earth, put a part in the breast of man to create 
enthusiasm or animation, and saved the remainder for the comfort of mankind 
to be used with the artist skill of Minerva and Vulcan. In Brittany the 
golden or fire-crested wren steals fire and is red-marked while so doing. 
The animals of the North American Indians are represented as stealing fire 
sometimes from the cuttle fish and sometimes from one another. Some swiftly-
flying bird or fleet-footed coyote would carry the stolen fire to the home 
of the tribe.

The possession of fire meant to the ancients all that wealth means family of 
today. It meant the possession of comfort. to the The gods were naturally 
determined to keep this wealth in their own hands. For any one to make a 
sharp deal and cheat a god of fire out of a part of this valuable property 
or to make a courageous raid upon the fire guardian and steal the treasure, 
was easily sufficient to make that one a "culture hero." As a matter of fact 
a prehistoric family without fire would go to any length in order to get it. 
The fire finders would naturally be the hero-gods and stealing fire would be 
an exploit rather than a crime.

It is worth noting that in many myths not only was fire stolen, but birds 
marked by red or black spots among their feathers were associated with the 
theft. It would naturally be supposed that the Hawaiians living in a 
volcanic country with ever-flowing fountains of lava, would connect their 
fire myths with some volcano when relating the story of the origin of fire. 
But like the rest of the Polynesians, they found fire in trees rather than 
in rivers of melted rock. They must have brought their fire legends and fire 
customs with them when they came to the islands of active volcanoes.

Flint rocks as fire producers are not found in the Hawaiian myths, nor in 
the stories from the island groups related to the Hawaiians. Indians might 
see the fleeing buffalo strike fire from the stones under his hard hoofs. 
The Tartars might have a god to teach them "the secret of the stone's edge 
and the iron's hardness." The Peruvians could very easily form a legend of 
their mythical father Guamansuri finding a way to make fire after he had 
seen the sling stones, thrown at his enemies, bring forth sparks of fire 
from the rocks against which they struck. The thunder and the lightning of 
later years were the sparks and the crash of stones hurled among the cloud 
mountains by the mighty gods.

In Australia the story is told of an old man and his daughter who lived in 
great darkness. After a time the father found the doorway of light through 
which the sun passed on his journey. He opened the door and a flood of 
sunshine covered the earth. His daughter looked around her home and saw 
numbers of serpents. She seized a staff and began to kill them. She wielded 
it so vigorously that it became hot in her bands. At last it broke, but the 
pieces rubbed against each other and flashed into sparks and flames. Thus it 
was learned that fire was buried in wood.

Flints were known in Europe and Asia and America, but the Polynesian looked 
to the banyan and kindred trees for the hidden sparks of fire. The natives 
of De Peyster's Island say that their ancestors learned how to make fire by 
seeing smoke rise from crossed branches rubbing together while trees were 
shaken by fierce winds.

In studying the Maui myths of the Pacific it is necessary to remember that 
Polynesians use "t" and "k" without distinguishing them apart, and also as 
in the Hawaiian Islands an apostrophe (') is often used in place of "t" or 
"k". Therefore the Maui Ki-i-k-i'i of Hawaii becomes the demi-god Tiki-tiki 
of the Gilbert Islands-or the Ti'i-ti'i of Samoa or the Tiki of New Zealand-
or other islands of the great ocean. We must also remember that in the 
Hawaiian legends Kalana is Maui's father. This in other groups becomes 
Talanga or Kalanga or Karanga. Kanaloa, the great god of most of the 
different Polynesians, is also sometimes called the Father of Maui. It is 
not strange that some of the exploits usually ascribed to Maui should be in 
some places transferred to his father under one name or the other. On one or 
two groups Mafuia, an ancestress of Maui, is mentioned as finding the fire. 
The usual legend makes Maui the one who takes fire away from Mafuia. The 
story of fire finding in Polynesia sifts itself to Maui under one of his 
widely-accepted names, or to his father or to his ancestress-with but very 
few exceptions. This fact is important as showing in a very marked manner 
the race relationship of a vast number of the islanders of the Pacific 
world. From the Marshall Islands, in the west, to the Society Islands of the 
east; from the Hawaiian Islands in the north to the New Zealand group in the 
south, the footsteps of the fire finder can be traced.

The Hawaiian story of fire finding is one of the least marvelous of all the 
legends. Hina, Maui's mother, wanted fish. One morning early Maui saw that 
the great storm waves of the sea had died down and the fishing grounds could 
be easily reached. He awakened his brothers and with them hastened to the 
beach. This was at Kaupo on the island of Maui. Out into the gray shadows of 
the dawn they paddled.

When they were far from shore they began to fish. But Maui, looking 
landward, saw a fire on the mountain side.

"Behold," he cried. "There is a fire burning. Whose can this fire be?"

"Whose, indeed?" his brothers replied.

"Let us hasten to the shore and cook our food," said one.

They decided that they had better catch some fish to cook before they 
returned. Thus, in the morning, before the hot sun drove the fish deep down 
to the dark recesses of the sea, they fished until a bountiful supply lay in 
the bottom of the canoe.

When they came to land, Maui leaped out and ran up the mountain side to get 
the fire. For a long, long time they had been without fire. The great 
volcano Haleakala above then, had become extinct-and they had lost the coals 
they had tried to keep alive. They had eaten fruits and uncooked roots and 
the shell fish broken from the reef-and sometimes the great raw fish from 
the far-out ocean. But now they hoped to gain living fire and cooked food.

But when Maui rushed up toward the cloudy pillar of smoke he saw a family of 
birds scratching the fire out. Their work was finished and they flew away 
just as he reached the place.

Maui and his brothers watched for fire day after day-but the birds, the 
curly-tailed Alae (or the mudhens) made no fire. Finally the brothers went 
fishing once more-but when they looked toward the mountain, again they saw 
flames and smoke. Thus it happened to them again and again.

Maui proposed to his brothers that they go fishing leaving him to watch the 
birds. But the Alae counted the fishermen and refused to build a fire for 
the hidden one who was watching them. They said among themselves, "Three are 
in the boat and we know not where the other one is, we will make no fire 
today."

So the experiment failed again and again. If one or two remained or if all 
waited on the land there would be no fire-but the dawn which saw the four 
brothers in the boat, saw also the fire on the land.

Finally Maui rolled some kapa cloth together and stuck it up in one end of 
the canoe so that it would look like a man. He then concealed himself near 
the haunt of the mud-hens, while his brothers went out fishing. The birds 
counted the figures in the boat and then started to build a heap of wood for 
the fire.

Maui was impatient-and just as the old Alae began to select sticks with 
which to make the flames he leaped swiftly out and caught her and held her 
prisoner. He forgot for a moment that he wanted the secret of fire making. 
In his anger against the wise bird his first impulse was to taunt her and 
then kill her for hiding the secret of fire.

But the Alae cried out: "If you are the death of me-my secret will perish 
also-and you cannot have fire."

Maui then promised to spare her life if she would tell him what to do.

Then came the contest of wits. The bird told the demi-god to rub the stalks 
of water plants together. He guarded the bird and tried the plants. Water 
instead of fire ran out of the twisted stems. Then she told him to rub reeds 
together-but they bent and broke and could make no fire. He twisted her neck 
until she was half dead-then she cried out: "I have hidden the fire in a 
green stick."

Maui worked hard, but not a spark of fire appeared. Again he caught his 
prisoner by the head and wrung her neck, and she named a kind of dry wood. 
Maui rubbed the sticks together, but they only became warm. The neck 
twisting process was resumed and repeated again and again, until the mud-hen 
was almost dead-and Maui had tried tree after tree. At last Maui found fire. 
Then as the flames rose he said: "There is one more thing to rub." He took a 
fire stick and rubbed the top of the head of his prisoner until the feathers 
fell off and the raw flesh appeared. Thus the Hawaiian mud-hen and her 
descendants have ever since had bald heads, and the Hawaiians have had the 
secret of fire making.

Another Hawaiian legend places the scene of Maui's contest with the mud-hens 
a little inland of the town of Hilo on the Island of Hawaii. There are three 
small extinct craters very near each other known as The Halae Hills. One, 
the southern or Puna side of the hills, is a place called Pohaku-nui. Here 
dwelt two brother birds of the Alae family. They were gods. One had the 
power of fire making. Here at Pohaku-nui they were accustomed to kindle a 
fire and bake their dearly loved food-baked bananas. Here Maui planned to 
learn the secret of fire. The birds had kindled the fire and the bananas 
were almost done, when the elder Alae called to the younger: "Be quick, here 
comes the swift son of Hina."

The birds scratched out the fire, caught the bananas and fled. Maui told his 
mother he would follow them until he learned the secret of fire. His mother 
encouraged him because he was very strong and very swift. So he followed the 
birds from place to place as they fled from him, finding new spots on which 
to make their fires. At last they came to the island Oahu. There he saw a 
great fire and a multitude of birds gathered around it, chattering loudly 
and trying to hasten the baking of the bananas. Their incantation was this: 
"Let us cook quick." "Let us cook quick." "The swift child of Hina will 
come."

Maui's mother Hina had taught him how to know the fire-maker. "If you go up 
to the fire, you will find many birds. Only one is the guardian. This is the 
small, young Alae. His name is Alae-iki: Only this one knows how to make 
fire." So whenever Maui came near to the fire-makers he always sought for 
the little Alae. Sometimes he made mistakes and soirietimes almost captured 
the one he desired. At Waianae he leaped suddenly among the birds. They 
scattered the fire, and the younger bird tried to snatch his banana from the 
coals and flee, but Maui seized him and began to twist his neck. The bird 
cried out, warning Maui not to kill him or he would lose the secret of fire 
altogether. Maui was told that the fire was made from a banana stump. He saw 
the bananas roasting and thought this was reasonable. So, according to 
directions, he began to rub together pieces of the banana. The bird hoped 
for an unguarded moment when be might escape, but Mau was very watchful and 
was also very angry when he found that rubbing only resulted in squeezing 
out juice. Then he twisted the neck of the bird and was told to rub the stem 
of the taro plant. This also was so green that it only produced water. Then 
he was so angry that he nearly rubbed the head of the bird off-and the bird, 
fearing for its life, told the truth and taught Maui how to find the wood in 
which fire dwelt.

They learned to draw out the sparks secreted in different kinds of trees. 
The sweet sandalwood was one of these fire trees. Its Hawaiian name is "Ili-
ahi" -the "ili" (bark) and "ahi" (fire), the bark in which fire is 
concealed.

A legend of the Society Islands is somewhat similar. Ina (Hina) promised to 
aid Maui in finding fire for the islanders. She sent him into the under-
world to find Tangaroa (Kanaloa). This god Tangaroa held fire in his 
possession-Maui was to know him by his tattooed face. Down the dark path 
through the long eaves Maui trod swiftly until he found the god. Maui asked 
him for fire to take up to men. The god gave him a lighted stick and sent 
him away. But Maui put the fire out and went back again after fire. This he 
did several times, until the wearied giver decided to teach the intruder the 
art of fire making. He called a white duck to aid him. Then, taking two 
sticks of dry wood, he gave the under one to the bird and rapidly moved the 
upper stick across the under until fire came, Maui seized the upper stick, 
after it had been charred in the flame, and burned the head of the bird back 
of each eye. Thus were made the black spots which mark the head of the white 
duck. Then arose a quarrel between Tangaroa and Maui-but Maui struck down 
the god, and, thinking he had killed him, carried away the art of making 
fire. His father and mother made inquiries about their relative-Maui 
hastened back to the fire fountain and made the spirit return to the body-
then, coming back to Ina, he bade her good bye and carried the fire sticks 
to the upper-world. The Hawaiians, and probably others among the 
Polynesians, felt that any state of unconsciousness was a form of death in 
which the spirit left the body, but was called back by prayers and 
incantations. Therefore, when Maui restored the god to consciousness, he was 
supposed to have made the spirit released by death return into the body and 
bring it back to life.

In the Samoan legends as related by G. Turner, the name Ti'iti'i is used. 
This is the same as the second name found in Maui Ki'i-ki'i. The Samoan 
legend of Ti'iti'i is almost identical with the New Zealand fire myth of 
Maui, and is very similar to the story coming from the Hervey Islands from 
Savage Island and also from the Tokelau and other island groups. The Samoan 
story says that the home of Mafuie the earthquake god was in the land of 
perpetual fire. Maui's or Ti'iti'i's father Talanga (Kalana) was also a 
resident of the under-world and a great friend of the earthquake god.

Ti'iti'i watched his father as he left his home in the upper-world. Talanga 
approached a perpendicular wall of rock, said some prayer or incantation-and 
passed through a door which immediately closed after him. (This is a very 
near approach to the "open sesame" of the Arabian Nights stories.)

Ti'iti'i went to the rock, but could not find the way through. He determined 
to conceal himself the next time so near that he could hear his father's 
words.

After some days he was able to catch all the words uttered by his iather as 
he knocked on the stone door-

"O rock! divide.
I am Talanga,
I come to work
On my land
Given by Mafuie."

Ti'iti'i went to the perpendicular wall and imitating his father's voice 
called for a rock to open. Down through a cave he passed until he found his 
father working in the under-world.

The astonished father, learning how his son came, bade him keep very quiet 
and work lest he arouse the anger of Mafuie. So for a time the boy labored 
obediently by his father's side.

In a little while the boy saw smoke and asked what it was. The father told 
him that it was the smoke from the fire of Mafuie, and explained what fire 
would do.

The boy determined to get some fire-he went to the place from which the 
smoke arose and there found the god, and asked him for fire. Mafuie gave him 
fire to carry to his father. The boy quickly had an oven prepared and the 
fire placed in it to cook some of the taro they had been cultivating. Just 
as everything was ready an earthquake god came up and blew the fire out and 
scattered the stones of the oven.

Then Ti'iti'i was angry and began to talk to Mafuie. The god attacked the 
boy, intending to punish him severely for daring to rebel against the 
destruction of the fire.

What a battle there was for a time in the underworld! At last Ti'iti'i 
seized one of the arms of Mafuie and broke it off. He caught the other arm 
and began to twist and bend it.

Mafuie begged the boy to spare him. His right arm was gone. How could he 
govern the earthquakes if his left arm were torn off also? It was his duty 
to hold Samoa level and not permit too many earthquakes. It would be hard to 
do that even with one arm-but it would be impossible if both arms were gone.

Ti'iti'i listened to the plea and demanded a reward if he should spare the 
left arm. Alafuie offered Ti'iti'i one hundred wives. The boy did not want 
them.

Then the god offered to teach him the secret of fire finding to take to the 
upper-world.

The boy agreed to accept the fire secret, and thus learned that the gods in 
making the earth had concealed fire in various trees for men to discover in 
their own good time, and that this fire could be brought out by rubbing 
pieces of wood together.

The people of Samoa have not had much faith in Mafuie's plea that he needed 
his left arm in order to keep Samoa level. They say that Mafuie has a long 
stick or handle to the world under the islands-and when he is angry or 
wishes to frighten them he moves this handle and easily shakes the islands. 
When an earthquake comes, they give thanks to Ti'iti'i for breaking off one 
arm-because if the god had two arms they believe he would shake them 
unmercifully.

One legend of the Hervey Islands says that Maui and his brothers had been 
living on uncooked food-but learned that their mother sometimes had 
delicious food which had been cooked. They learned also that fire was needed 
in order to cook their food. Then Alatii wanted fire and watched his mother.

Maui's mother was the guardian of the way to the invisible world. When she 
desired to pass from her home to the other world, she would open a black 
rock and pass inside. Thus she went to Hawaiki, the under-world. Maui 
planned to follow her, but first studied the forms of birds that he might 
assume the body of the strongest and most enduring. After a time he took the 
shape of a pigeon and, flying to the black rock, passed through the door and 
flew down the long dark passage-way.

After a time he found the god of fire living in a bunch of banyan sticks. He 
changed himself into the form of a man and demanded the secret of fire.

The fire god agreed to give Maui fire if he would permit himself to be 
tossed into the sky by the god's strong arms.

Maui agreed on condition that he should have the right to toss the fire god 
afterwards.

The fire-god felt certain that there would be only one exercise of strength-
he felt that he had everything in his own hands-so readily agreed to the 
tossing contest. It was his intention to throw his opponent so high that 
when he fell, if he ever did fall, there would be no antagonist uncrushed.

He seized Maui in his strong arms and, swinging him back and forth, flung 
him upward-but the moment Maui left his hands he changed himself into a 
feather and floated softly to the ground.

Then the boy ran swiftly to the god and seized him by the legs and lifted 
him up. Then he began to increase in size and strength until he had lifted 
the fire god very high. Suddenly he tossed the god upward and caught him as 
he fell-again and again-until the bruised and dizzy god cried enough, and 
agreed to give the victor whatever he demanded.

Maui asked for the secret of fire producing. The god taught him how to rub 
the dry sticks of certain kinds of trees together, and, by friction, produce 
fire, and especially how fire could be produced by rubbing fire sticks in 
the fine dust of the banyan tree.

A Society Island legend says Maui borrowed a sacred red pigeon, belonging to 
one of the gods, and, changing himself into a dragon fly, rode this pigeon 
through a black rock into Avaiki (Hawaiki), the fire-land of the under-
world. He found the god of fire, Mau-ika, living in a house built from a 
banyan tree. Mau-ika taught Maui the kinds of wood into which when fire went 
out on the earth a fire goddess had thrown sparks in order to preserve fire. 
Among these were the "au" (Hawaiian hau), or "the lemon hibiscus"-the 
"argenta," the "fig" and the "banyan." She taught him also how to make fire 
by swift motion when rubbing the sticks of these trees. She also gave him 
coals for his present need.

But Maui was viciously mischievous and set the banyan house on fire, then 
mounted his pigeon and fled toward the upper-world. But the flames hastened 
after him and burst out through the rock doors into the sunlit land above-as 
if it were a volcanic eruption.

The Tokelau Islanders say that Talanga (Kalana) known in other groups of 
islands as the father of Maui, desired fire in order to secure warmth and 
cooked food. He went down, down, very far down in the caves of the earth. In 
the lower world he found Mafuika-an old blind woman, who was the guardian of 
fire. He told her he wanted fire to take back to men. She refused either to 
give fire or to teach how to make it. Talanga threatened to kill her, and 
finally persuaded her to teach how to make fire in any place he might dwell-
and the proper trees to use, the fire-yielding trees. She also taught him 
how to cook food-and also the kind of fish he should cook, and the kinds 
which should be eaten raw. Thus mankind learned about food as well as fire.

The Savage Island legend adds the element of danger to Maui's mischievous 
theft of fire. The lad followed his father one day and saw him pull up a 
bunch of reeds and go down into the fire-land beneath. Maui hastened down to 
see what his father was doing.

Soon he saw his oportunity to steal the secret of fire. Then he caught some 
fire and started for the upperworld.

His father caught a glimpse of the young thief and tried to stop him.

Maui ran up the passage through the black cave-bushes and trees bordered his 
road.

The father hastened after his son and was almost ready to lay hands upon 
him, when Maui set fire to the bushes. The flames spread rapidly, catching 
the underbrush and the trees on all sides and burst out in the face of the 
pursuer. Destruction threatened the under-world, but Maui sped along his 
way. Then he saw that the fire was chasing him. Bush after bush leaped into 
flame and hurled sparks and smoke and burning air after him. Choked and 
smoke-surrounded, he broke through the door of the cavern and found the 
fresh air of the world. But the flames followed him and swept out in great 
power upon the upperworld a mighty volcanic eruption.

The New Zealand legends picture Maui as putting out, in one night, all the 
fires of his people. This was serious mischief, and Maui's mother decided 
that he should go to the under-world and see his ancestress, Mahuika, the 
guardian of fire, and get new fire to repair the injury he had wrought. She 
warned him against attempting to play tricks upon the inhabitants of the 
lower regions.

Maui gladly hastened down the cave-path to the house of Mahuika, and asked 
for fire for the upperworld. In some way he pleased her so that she pulled 
off a finger nail in which fire was burning and gave it to him. As soon as 
he had gone back to a place where there was water, he put the fire out and 
returned to Mahuika, asking another gift, which he destroyed. This he did 
for both hands and feet until only one nail remained. Maui wanted this. Then 
Mahuika became angry and threw the last finger nail on the ground. Fire 
poured out and laid hold of everything. Maui ran up the path to the upper-
world, but the fire was swifter-footed. Then Maui changed himself into an 
eagle and flew high up nto the air, but the fire and smoke still followed 
him. Then he saw water and dashed into it, but it was too hot. Around him 
the forests were blazing, the earth burning and the sea boiling. Maui, about 
to perish, called on the gods for rain. Then floods of water fell and the 
fire was checked. The great rain fell on Mahuika and she fled, almost 
drowned. Her stores of fire were destroyed, quenched by the storm. But in 
order to save fire for the use of men, as she fled she threw sparks into 
different kinds of trees where the rain could not reach them, so that when 
fire was needed it might be brought into the world again by rubbing together 
the fire sticks.

The Chatham Islanders give the following incantation, which they said was 
used by Maui against the fierce flood of fire which was pursuing him:

"To the roaring thunder;
To the great rain-the long rain;
To the drizzling rain-the small rain;
To the rain pattering on the leaves.
These are the storms-the storms
Cause them to fall;
To pour in torrents."

The legend of Savage Island places Maui in the role of fire-maker. He has 
stolen fire in the underworld. His father tries to catch him, but Maui sets 
fire to the bushes by the path until a great conflagration is raging which 
pursues him to the upper-world.

Some legends make Maui the fire-teacher as well as the fire-finder. He 
teaches men how to use hardwood sticks in the fine dry dust on the bark of 
certain trees, or how to use the fine fibre of the palm tree to catch 
sparks.

In Tahiti the fire god lived in the "Hale-a-o-a," or House of the Banyan. 
Sometimes human sacrifices were placed upon the sacred branches of this tree 
of the fire god.

In the Bowditch or Fakaofa Islands the goddess of fire when conquered taught 
not only the method of making fire by friction but also what fish were to be 
cooked and what were to be eaten raw.

Thus some of the myths of Maui, the mischievous, finding fire are told by 
the side of the inrolling surf, while natives of many islands, around their 
poi bowls, rest in the shade of the far-reaching boughs and thick foliage of 
the banyan and other fire producing trees.

VI.
MAUI THE SKILLFUL.
ACCORDING to the New Zealand legends there were six Mauis-the Hawaiians 
counted four. They were a band of brothers. The older five were known as 
"the forgetful Mauis." The tricky and quick-witted youngest member of the 
family was called Maui te atamai-"Maui the skillful."

He was curiously accounted for in the New Zealand under-world. When he went 
down through the long cave to his ancestor's home to find fire, he was soon 
talked about. "Perhaps this is the man about whom so much is said in the 
upper-world." His ancestress from whom be obtained fire recognized him as 
the man called "the deceitful Maui." Even his parents told him once, "We 
know you are a tricky fellow-more so than any other man." One of the New 
Zealand fire legends while recording his flight to the under-world and his 
appearance as a bird, says: "The men tried to spear him, and to catch him in 
nets. At last they cried out, 'Maybe you are the man whose fame is great in 
the upper-world.' At once he leaped to the ground and appeared in the form 
of a man."

He was not famous for inventions, but he was always ready to improve upon 
anything which was already in existence. He could take the sun in hand and 
make it do better work. He could tie the moon so that it had to swim back 
around the island to the place in the ocean from which it might rise again, 
and go slowly through the night.

His brothers invented a slender, straight and smooth spear with which to 
kill birds. He saw the fluttering, struggling birds twist themselves off the 
smooth point and escape. He made a good light bird spear and put notches in 
it and kept most of the birds stuck. His brothers finally examined his spear 
and learned the reason for its superiority. In the same way they learned how 
to spear fish. They could strike and wound and sometimes kill-but they could 
not with their smooth spears draw the fish from the waters of the coral 
caves. But Maui the youngest made barbs, so that the fish could not easily 
shake themselves loose. The others soon made their spears like his.

The brothers were said to have invented baskets in which to trap eels, but 
many eels escaped. Maui improved the basket by secretly making an inside 
partition as well as a cover, and the eels were securely trapped. It took 
the brothers a long time to learn the real difference between their baskets 
and his. One of the family made a basket like his and caught many eels. Then 
Maui became angry and chanted a curse over him and bewildered him, then 
changed him into a dog.

The Manahiki Islanders have the legend that Maui made the moon, but could 
not get good light from it. He tried experiments and found that the sun was 
quite an improvernent. The sun's example stimulated the moon to shine 
brighter.

Once Maui became interested in tattooing and tried to make a dog look better 
by placing dark lines around the mouth. The legends say that one of the 
sacred birds saw the pattern and then marked the sky with the red lines 
sometimes seen at sunrise and sunset. An Hawaiian legend says that Maui 
tattooed his arm with a sacred name and thus that arm was strong enough to 
hold the sun when he lassoed it. There is a New Zealand legend in which Maui 
is made one of three gods who first created man and then woman from one of 
the man's ribs.

The Hawaiians dwelling in Hilo have many stories of Maui. They say that his 
home was on the northern bank of the Wailuku River. He had a strong staff 
made from, an ohia tree (the native apple tree). With this he punched holes 
through the lava, making natural bridges and boiling pools, and new channels 
for its sometimes obstructed waters, so that the people could go up or down 
the river more easily. Near one of the natural bridges is a figure of the 
moon carved in the rocks, referred by some of the natives to Maui.

Maui is said to have taught his brothers the different kinds of fish nets 
and the use of the strong fibre of the olona, which was much better than 
cocoanut threads.

The New Zealand stories relate the spear-throwing contests of Maui and his 
brothers. As children, however, they were not allowed the use of wooden 
spears. They took the stems of long, heavy reeds and threw them at each 
other, but Maui's reeds were charmed into stronger and harder fibre so that 
he broke his mother's house and made her recognize him as one of her 
children. He had been taken away as soon as he was born by the gods to whom 
he was related. When he found his way back home his mother paid no attention 
to him. Thus by a spear thrust he won a horne.

The brothers all made fish hooks, but Maui the youngest made two kinds of 
hooks-one like his brothers' and one with a sharp barb. His brothers' hooks 
were smooth so that it was difficult to keep the fish from floundering and 
shaking themselves off, but they noticed that the fish were held by Maui's 
hook better than by theirs. Maui was not inclined to devote himself to hard 
work, and lived on his brothers as much as possible-but when driven out by 
his wife or his mother he would catch more fish than the other fishermen. 
They tried to examine his hooks, but he always changed his hooks so that 
they could not see any difference between his and theirs. At such times they 
called him the mischievous one and tried to leave him behind while they went 
fishing. They were, however, always ready to give him credit for his 
improvements. They dealt generously with him when they learned what he had 
really accom, plished. When they caught him with his barbed hook they forgot 
the past and called him "ke atamai"-the skillful.

The idea that fish hooks made from the jawbones of human beings were better 
than others, seemed to have arisen at first from the angle formed in the 
lower jawbone. Later these human fish hooks were considered sacred and 
therefore possessed of magic powers. The greater sanctity and power belonged 
to the bones which bore more especial relation to the owner. Therefore 
Maui's "magic hook," with which he fished up islands, was made from the 
jawbone of his ancestress Malmika. It is also said that in order to have 
powerful hooks for every-day fishing he killed two of his children. Their 
right eyes he threw tip into the sky to become stars. One became the morning 
and the other the evening star.

The idea that the death of any members of the family must not stand in the 
way of obtaining magical power, has prevailed throughout Polynesia. From 
this angle in the jawbone Maui must have conceived the idea of making a hook 
with a piece of bone or shell which should be fastened to the large bone at 
a very sharp angle, thus making a kind of barb. Hooks like this have been 
made for ages among the Polynesians.

Maui and his brothers went fishing for eels with bait strung on the flexible 
rib of a cocoanut leaf. The stupid brothers did not fasten the ends of the 
string. Therefore the eels easily slipped the bait off and escaped. But Maui 
made the ends of his string fast, and captured many eels.

The little things which others did not think about were the foundation of 
Maui's fame. Upon these little things he built his courage to snare the sun 
and seek fire for mankind.

In a New Zealand legend, quoted by Edward Tregear, Maui is called Maui-maka-
walu, or "Maui with eyes eight." This eight-eyed Maui would be allied to the 
Hindoo deities who with their eight eyes face the four quarters of the 
world-thus possessing both insight into the affairs of men and foresight 
into the future.

Fornander, the Hawaiian ethnologist, says: "In Hawaiian mythology, Kamapuaa, 
the demigod opponent of the goddess Pele, is described as having eight eyes 
and eight feet; and in the legends Maka-walu, 'eight-eyed,' is a frequent 
epithet of gods and chiefs." He notes this coincidence with the appearance 
of some of the principal Hindoo deities as having some bearing upon the 
origin of the Polynesians. It may be that a comparative study of the legends 
of other islands of the Pacific by some student will open up other new and 
important facts.

In Tahiti, on the island Raiatea, a high priest or prophet lived in the 
long, long ago. He was known as Maui the prophet of Tahiti. He was probably 
not Maui the demigod. Nevertheless he was represented as possessing very 
strange prophetical powers.

According to the historian Ellis, who previous to 1830 spent eight years in 
the Society and Hawaiian Islands, this prophet Maui clearly prophesied the 
coming of an outriggerless canoe from some foreign land. An outrigger is a 
log which so balances a canoe that it can ride safely through the 
treacherous surf.

The chiefs and prophets charged him with stating the impossible.

He took his wooden calabash and placed it in a pool of water as an 
illustration of the way such a boat should float.

Then with the floating bowl before him he uttered the second prophecy, that 
boats without line to tie the sails to the masts, or the masts to the ships, 
should also come to Tahiti.

When English ships under Captain Wallis and Captain Cook, in the latter part 
of the eighteenth century, visited these islands, the natives cried out, "O 
the canoes of Maui-the outriggerless canoes."

Passenger steamships, and the men-of-war from the great nations, have taught 
the Tahitians that boats without sails and masts can cross the great ocean, 
and again they have recurred to the words of the prophet Maui, and have 
exclaimed, "O the boats without sails and masts." This rather remarkable 
prophecy could easily have occurred to Maui as he saw a wooden calabash 
floating over rough waters.

Maui's improvement upon nature's plan in regard to certain birds is also 
given in the legends as a proof of his supernatural powers.

White relates the story as follows: "Maui requested some birds to go and 
fetch water for him. The first one would not obey, so he threw it into the 
water. He requested another bird to go-and it refused, so he threw it into 
the fire, and its feathers were burnt. Dut the next bird obeyed, but could 
not carry the water, and he rewarded it by making the feathers of the fore 
part of its head white. Then he asked another bird to go, and it filled its 
ears with water and brought it to Maui, who drank, and then pulled the 
bird's legs and made them long in payment for its act of kindness."

Diffenbach says: "Maui, the Adam of New Zealand, left the cat's cradle to 
the New Zealanders as an inheritance." The name "Whai" was given to the 
game. It exhibited the various steps of creation according to Maori 
mythology. Every change in the cradle shows some act in creation. Its 
various stages were called "houses." Diffenbach says again: "In this game of 
Maui they are great proficients. It is a game like that called cat's cradle 
in Europe. It is intimately connected with their ancient traditions and in 
the different figures which the cord is made to assume whilst held on both 
hands, the outline of their different varieties of houses, canoes or figures 
of men and women are imagined to be represented." One writer connects this 
game with witchcraft, and says it was brought from the under-world. Some 
parts of the puzzle show the adventures of Maui, especially his attempt to 
win immortality for men.

In New Zealand it was said Maui found a large, fine-grained stone block, 
broke it in pieces, and from the fragments learned how to fashion stone 
implements.

White also tells the New Zealand legend of Maui and the winds.

"Maui caught and held all the winds save the west wind. He put each wind 
into a cave, so that it might not blow. He sought in vain for the west wind, 
but could not find from whence it came. If he had found the cave in which it 
stayed he would have closed the entrance to that cave with rocks. When the 
west wind blows lightly it is because Maui has got near to it, and has 
nearly caught it, and it has gone into its home, the cave, to escape him. 
When the winds of the south, east, and north blow furiously it is because 
the rocks have been removed by the stupid people who could not learn the 
lessons taught by Maui. At other times Maui allows these winds to blow in 
hurricanes to punish that people, and also that he may ride on these furious 
winds in search of the west wind."

In the Hawaiian legends Maui is represented as greatly interested in making 
and flying kites. His favorite place for the sport was by the boiling pools 
of the Wailuku river near Hilo. He had the winds under his control and would 
call for them to push his kites in the direction he wished. His incantation 
calling up the winds is given in this Maui proverb-

"Strong wind come,
Soft wind come."

White in his "Ancient History of the Maoris," relates some of Maui's 
experiences with the people whom he found on the islands brought up from the 
under-world. On one island he found a sand house with eight hundred gods 
living in it. Apparently Maui discovered islands with inhabitants, and was 
reported to have fished them up out of the depths of the ocean. Fishing was 
sailing over the ocean until distant lands were drawn near or "fished up."

Maui walked over the islands and found men living on them and fires burning 
near their homes. He evidently did not know much about fire, for he took it 
in his hands. He was badly burned and rushed into the sea. Down he dived 
under the cooling waters and came up with one of the New Zealand islands on 
his shoulders. But his hands were still burning, so wherever he held the 
island it was set on fire.

These fires are still burning in the secret recesses of the volcanoes, and 
sometimes burst out in flowing lava. Then Maui paid attention to the people 
whom he had fished up. He tried to teach them, but they did not learn as he 
thought they should. He quickly became angry and said, "It is a waste of 
light for the sun to shine on such stupid people." So he tried to hold his 
hands between them and the sun, but th rays of the sun were too many and too 
strong; there fore, he could not shut them out. Then he tried the moon and 
managed to make it dark a part of the time each month. In this way he made a 
little trouble for the stupid people.

There are other hints in the legends concerning Maui's desire to be revenged 
upon any one who incurred his displeasure. It was said that Maui for a time 
lived in the heavens above the earth. Here he had a foster brother Maru. The 
two were cultivating the fields. Maru sent a snowstorm over Maui's field. 
(It would seem as if this might be a Polynesian memory of a cold land where 
their ancestors knew the cold winter, or a lesson learned from the snow-caps 
of high mountains.) At any rate, the snow blighted Maui's crops. Maui 
retaliated by praying for rain to destroy Maru's fields. But Maru managed to 
save a part of his crops. Other legends make Maui the aggressor. At the 
last, however, Maui became very angry. The foster parents tried to soothe 
the two men by saying, "Live in peace with each other and do not destroy 
each other's food." But Maui was implacable and lay in wait for his foster 
brother, who was in the habit of carrying fruit and grass as an offering to 
the gods of a temple situated on the summit of a hill. Here Maui killed Maru 
and then went away to the earth.

This legend is told by three or four different, tribes of New Zealand and is 
very similar to the Hebrew story of Cain and Abel. At this late day it is 
difficult to say definitely whether or not it owes its origin to the early 
touch of Christianity upon New Zealand when white men first began to live 
with the natives. It is somewhat similar to stories found in the Tonga 
Islands and also in the Hawaiian group, where a son of the first gods, or 
rather of the first men, kills a brother. In each case there is the shadow 
of the Biblical idea. It seems safe to infer that such legends are not 
entirely drawn from contact with Christian civilization. The natives claim 
that these stories are very ancient, and that their fathers knew them before 
the white men sailed on the Pacific.

VII.
MAUI AND TUNA.
WHEN Maui returned from the voyages in which he discovered or "fished up" 
from the ocean depths new islands, he gave deep thought to the things he had 
found. As the islands appeared to come out of the water he saw they were 
inhabited. There were houses and stages for drying and preserving food. He 
was greeted by barking dogs. Fires were burning, food cooking and people 
working. He evidently had gone so far away from home that a strange people 
was found. The legend which speaks of the death of his brothers, "eaten" by 
the great fish drawn up from the floor of the sea, may very easily mean that 
the new people killed and ate the brothers.

Maui apparently learned some new lessons, for on his return he quickly 
established a home of his own, and determined to live after the fashion of 
the families in the new islands.

Maui sought Hina-a-te-lepo, "daughter of the swamp," and secured her as his 
wife. The New Zealand tribes tell legends which vary in different localities 
about this woman Hina. She sometimes bore the name Rau-kura-"The red plume."

She cared for his thatched house as any other Polynesian woman was in the 
habit of doing. She attempted the hurried task of cooking his food before he 
snared the sun and gave her sufficient daylight for her labors.

They lived near the bank of a river from which Hina was in the habit of 
bringing water for the household needs.

One day she went down to the stream with her calabash. She was entwined with 
wreaths of leaves and flowers, as was the custom among Polynesian women. 
While she was standing on the bank, Tuna-roa, "the long eel," saw her. He 
swam up to the bank and suddenly struck her and knocked her into the water 
and covered her with slime from the blow given by his tail.

Hina escaped and returned to her home, saying nothing to Maui about the 
trouble. But the next day, while getting water, she was again overthrown and 
befouled by the slime of Tuna-roa.

Then Hina became angry and reported the trouble to Maui.

Maui decided to punish the long eel and started out to find his hiding 
place. Somie of the New Zealand legends as collected by White, state that 
Tuna-roa was a very smooth skinned chief, who lived on the opposite bank of 
the stream, and, seeing Hina, had insulted her.

When Maui saw this chief, he caught two pieces of wood over which he was 
accustomed to slide his canoe into the sea. These he carried to the stream 
and laid them from bank to bank as a bridge over which he might entice Tuna-
roa to cross.

Maui took his stone axe, Ma-Tori-Tori, "the severer," and concealed himself 
near the bank of the river.

When "the long eel" had crossed the stream, Maui rushed out and killed him 
with a mighty blow of the stone axe, cutting the head from the body.

Other legends say that Maui found Tuna-roa living as an eel in a deep water 
hole, in a swamp on the seacoast of Tata-a, part of the island Ao-tea-roa. 
Other stories located Tuna-roa in the river near Maui's home.

Maui saw that he could not get at his enemy without letting off the water 
which protected him.

Therefore into the forest went Maui, and with sacred ceremonies, selected 
trees from the wood of which he prepared tools and weapons.

Meanwhile, in addition to the insult given to Hina, Tuna-roa had caught and 
devoured two of Maui's children, which made Maui more determined to kill 
him.

Maui made the narrow spade (named by the Maoris of New Zealand the "ko," and 
by the Hawaiians "o-o") and the sharp spears, with which to pierce either 
the earth or his enemy. These spears and spades were consecrated to the work 
of preparing a ditch by which to draw off the water protecting "the long 
eel."

The work of trench-making was accomplished with many incantations and 
prayers. The ditch was named "The sacred digging," and was tabooed to all 
other purposes except that of catching Tuna-roa.

Across this ditch Maui stretched a strong net, and then began a new series 
of chants and ceremonies to bring down an abundance of rain. Soon the flood 
came and the overflowing waters rushed down the sacred ditch. The walls of 
the deep pool gave way and "the long eel" was carried down the trench into 
the waiting net. Then there was commotion. Tuna-roa was struggling for 
freedom.

Maui saw him and hastened to grasp his stone axe, "the severer." Hurrying to 
the net, he struck Tuna-roa a terrible blow, and cut off the head. With a 
few more blows, he cut the body in pieces. The head and tail were carried 
out into the sea. The head became fish and the tail became the great conger-
eel. Other parts of the body became sea monsters. But some parts which fell 
in fresh water became the common eels. From the hairs of the head came 
certain vines and creepers among the plants.

After the death of Tuna-roa the offspring of Maui were in no danger of being 
killed and soon multiplied into a large family.

Another New Zealand legend related by White says that Maui built a sliding 
place of logs, over which Tuna-roa must pass when coming from the river.

Maui also made a screen behind which he could secrete himself while watching 
for Tuna-roa.

He commanded Hina to come down to the river and wait on the bank to attract 
Tuna-roa. Soon the long eel was seen in the water swimming near to Hina. 
Hina went to a place back of the logs which Maui had laid down.

Tuna-roa came towards her, and began to slide down the skids.

Maui sprang out from his hiding place and killed Tuna-roa with his axe, and 
cut him in pieces.

The tail became the conger-eel. Parts of his body became fresh-water eels. 
Some of the blood fell upon birds and always after marked them with red 
spots. Some of the blood was thrown into certain trees, making this wood 
always red. The muscles became vines and creepers.

From this time the children of Maui caught and ate the eels of both salt and 
fresh water. Eel traps were made, and Maui taught the people the proper 
chants or incantations to use when catching eels.

This legend of Maui and the long eel was found by White in a number of forms 
among the different tribes of New Zealand, but does not seem to have had 
currency in many other island groups.

In Turner's "Samoa" a legend is related which was probably derived from the 
Maui stories and yet differs in its romantic results. The Samoans say that 
among their ancient ones dwelt a woman named Sina. Sina among the 
Polynesians is the same as Hina-the "h" is softened into "s". She captured a 
small eel and kept it as a pet. It grew large and strong and finally 
attacked and bit her. She fled, but the eel followed her evervwhere. Her 
father came to her assistance and raised high mountains between the eel and 
herself.

But the eel passed over the barrier and pursued her. Her mother raised a new 
series of mountains. But again the eel surmounted the difficulties and 
attempted to seize Sina. She broke away from him and ran on and on. Finally 
she wearily passed through a village. The people asked her to stay and eat 
with them, but she said they could only help her by delivering her from the 
pursuing eel. The inhabitants of that village were afraid of the eel and 
refused to fight for her. So she ran on to another place. Here the chief 
offered her a drink of water and promised to kill the eel for her. He 
prepared awa, a stupefying drink, and put poison in it. When the eel came 
along the chief asked him to drink. He took the awa and prepared to follow 
Sina. When he came to the place where she was the pains of death had already 
seized him. While dying he begged her to bury his head by her home. This she 
did, and in time a plant new to the islands sprang up. It became a tree, and 
finally produced a cocoanut, whose two eyes could continually look into the 
face of Sina.

Tuna, in the legends of Fiji, was a demon of the sea. He lived in a deep sea 
cave, into which he sometimes shut himself behind closed doors of coral. 
When he was hungry, he swam through the ocean shadows, always watching the 
restless surface. When a canoe passed above him, he would throw himself 
swiftly through the waters, upset the canoe, and seize some of the boatmen 
and devour them. He was greatly feared by all the fishermen of the Fijian 
coasts.

Roko-a mo-o or dragon god-in his journey among the islands, stopped at a 
village by the sea and asked for a canoe and boatmen. The people said: "We 
have nothing but a very old canoe out there by the water." He went to it and 
found it in a very bad condition. He put it in the water, and decided that 
he could use it. Then he asked two men to go with him and paddle, but they 
refused because of fear, and explained this fear by telling the story of the 
water demon, who continually sought the destruction of this canoe, and also 
their own death. Roko encouraged them to take him to wage battle with Tuna, 
telling them he would destroy the monster. They paddled until they were 
directly over Tuna's cave. Roko told them to go off to one side and wait and 
watch, saying: "I am going down to see this Tuna. If you see red blood boil 
up through the water, you may be sure that Tuna has been killed. If the 
blood is black, then you will know that he has the victory and I am dead."

Roko leaped into the water and went down-down to the door of the cave. The 
coral doors were closed. He grasped them in his strong hands and tore them 
open, breaking them in pieces. Inside he found cave after cave of coral, and 
broke his way through until at last he awoke Tuna. The angry demon cried: 
"Who is that?" Roko answered: "It is I, Roko, alone. Who are you?"

Tuna aroused himself and demanded Roko's business and who guided him to that 
place. Roko replied: "No one has guided me. I go from place to place, 
thinking that there is no one else in the world."

Tuna shook himself angrily. "Do you think I am nothing? This day is your 
last."

Roko replied: "Perhaps so. If the sky falls, I shall die."

Tuna leaped upon Roko and bit him. Then came the mighty battle of the coral 
caves. Roko broke Tuna into several pieces-and the red blood poured in 
boiling bubbles upward through the clear ocean waters, and the boatmen 
cried: "The blood is red the blood is red-Tuna is dead by the hand of Roko."

Roko lived for a time in Fiji, where his descendants still find their home. 
The people use this chant to aid them in difficulties:

My load is a red one.
It points in front to Kawa (Roko's home).
Behind, it points to Dolomo-(a village on another island)."

In the Hawaiian legends, Hina was Maui's mother rather than his wife, and 
Kuna (Tuna) was a mo-o, a dragon or gigantic lizard possessing miraculous 
powers.

Hina's home was in the large cave under the beautiful Rainbow Falls near the 
city of Hilo. Above the falls the bed of the river is along the channel of 
an ancient lava flow. Sometimes the water pours in a torrent over the rugged 
lava, sometimes it passes through underground passages as well as along the 
black river bed, and sometimes it thrusts itself into boiling pools.

Maui lived on the northern side of the river, but a chief named Kuna-moo-a 
dragon-lived in the boiling pools. He attacked Hina and threw a dam across 
the river below Rainbow Falls, intending to drown Hina in her cave. The 
great ledge of rock filled the river bed high up the bank on the Hilo side 
of the river. Hina called on Maui for aid. Maui came quickly and with mighty 
blows cut out a new channel for the river-the path it follows to this day. 
The waters sank and Hina remained unharmed in her cave.

The place where Kuna dwelt was called Wai-kuna -the Kuna water. The river in 
which Hina and Kuna dwelt bears the name Wailuku-"the destructive water." 
Maui went above Kuna's home and poured hot water into the river. This part 
of the myth could easily have arisen from a lava outburst on the side of the 
volcano above the river. The hot water swept in a flood over Kuna's home. 
Kuna jumped from the boiling pools over a series of small falls near his 
home into the river below. Here the hot water again scalded him and in pain 
he leaped from the river to the bank, where Maui killed him by beating him 
with a club. His body was washed down the river over the falls under which 
Hina dwelt, into the ocean.

The story of Kuna or Tuna is a legend with a foundation in the enmity 
between two chiefs of the long ago, and also in a desire to explain the 
origin of the family of eels and the invention of nets and traps.

VIII.
MAUI AND HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW.
THE "Stories of Maui's Brother-in-Law," and of "Maui seeking Immortality," 
are not found in Hawaiian mythology. We depend upon Sir George Grey and John 
White for the New Zealand myths in which both of these legends occur.

Maui's sister Hina-uri married Ira-waru, who was willing to work with his 
skillful brother-in-law. They hunted in the forests and speared birds. They 
fished and farmed together. They passed through many experiences similar to 
those Maui's own brothers had suffered before the brother-in-law took their 
place as Maui's companion. They made spears together-but Maui made notched 
barbs for his spear ends-and slipped them off when Ira-waru came near. So 
for a long time the proceeds of bird hunting fell to Maui. But after a time 
the brother-in-law learned the secret as the brothers had before, and Maui 
was looked up to by his fellow hunter as the skillful one. Sometimes Ira-
waru was able to see at once Maui's plan and adopt it. He discovered Maui's 
method of making the punga or eel baskets for catching eels.

The two hunters went to the forest to find a certain creeping vine with 
which to weave their eel snares. Ira-waru made a basket with a hole, by 
which the eels could enter, but they could turn around and go out the same 
way. So he very seldom caught an eel. But Maui made his basket with a long 
funnelshaped door, by which the eels could easily slide into the snare but 
could scarcely escape. He made a door in the side which he fastened tight 
until he wished to pour the eels out.

Ira-waru immediately made a basket like Maui. Then Maui became angry and 
uttered incantations over Ira-waru. The man dropped on the ground and became 
a dog. Maui returned home and met his sister, who charged him with sorcery 
concerning her husband.

Maui did not deny the exercise of his power, but taught his sister a chant 
and sent her out to the level country. There she uttered her chant and a 
strange dog with long hair came to her, barking and leaping around her. Then 
she knew what Maui had done. "Thus Ira-waru became the first of the long-
haired dogs whose flesh has been tabooed to women."

The Tahu and Han tribes of New Zealand tell a different story. They say that 
Maui went to visit Ira-waru. Together they set out on a journey. After a 
time they rested by the wayside and became sleepy. Maui asked Ira-waru to 
cleanse his head. This gave him the restful, soothing touch which aided 
sleep. Then Maui proposed that Ira-waru sleep. Taking the head in his hands, 
Maui put his brother-in-law to sleep. Then by incantations he made the sleep 
very deep and prolonged. Meanwhile he pulled the ears and arms and limbs 
until they were properly lengthened. He drew out the under jaw until it had 
the form of a dog's mouth. He stretched the end of the backbone into a tail, 
and then wakened Ira-waru and drove him back when he tried to follow the 
path to the settlement.

Hina-uri went out and called her husband. He came to her, leaping and 
barking. She decided that this was her husband, and in her agony reproached 
Maui and wandered away.

The Rua-nui story-tellers of New Zealand say that Maui's anger was aroused 
against Ira-waru because he ate all the bait when thev went fishing, and 
they could catch no fish after paddling out to the fishing grounds. When 
they carne to land, Maui told Irawarn to lie down in the sand as a roller 
over which to drag the canoe up the beach. When he was lying helpless under 
the canoe, Maui changed him into a dog.

The Arawa legends make the cause of Maui's anger the success of Ira-waru 
while fishing. Ira-waru had many fish while Maui had captured but few. The 
story is told thus: "Ira-waru hooked a fish and in pulling it in his line 
became entangled with that of Maui. Maui felt the jerking and began to pull 
in his line. Soon they pulled their lines close up to the canoe, one to the 
bow, the other to the stern, where each was sitting. Maui said: 'Let me pull 
the lines to me, as the fish is on my hook.' His brother-in-law said: 'Not 
so; the fish is on mine.' But Maui said: 'Let me pull my line in.' Ira-waru 
did so and saw that the fish was on his hook. Then he said: 'Untwist your 
lines and let mine go, that I may pull the fish in.' Maui said: I will do 
so, but let me have time.' He took the fish off Ira-waru's hook and saw that 
there was a barb on the hook. He said to Ira-waru: 'Perhaps we ought to 
return to land! When they were dragging the canoe on shore, Maui said to 
Ira-waru: 'Get between the canoe and outrigger and drag.' Irawaru did so and 
Maui leaped on the outrigger and weighed it heavily down and crushed Ira-
waru prostrate on the beach. Maui trod on him and pulled his backbone long 
like a tail and changed him into a dog."

Maui is said to have tattooed the muzzle of the dog with a beautiful pattern 
which the birds (kahui-zara, a flock of tern) used in marking the sky. From 
this also came the red glow which sometimes flushes the face of man.

Another Arawa version of the legend was that Mau and Ira-waru were 
journeying together. Ira-waru wa gluttonous and ate the best food. At last 
Maui determined to punish his companion. By incantation lengthened the way 
until Ira-waru became faint an weary. Maui had provided himself with a 
little food and therefore was enabled to endure the long way. While Ira-waru 
slept Maui trod on his backbone and lengthened it and changed the arms and 
limbs into the legs of a dog. When Hina-uri saw the state of her husband she 
went into the thatched house by which Ira-waru had so often stood watching 
the hollow log in which she dried the fish and preserved the birds speared 
in the mountains. She bound her girdle and hala-leaf apron around her and 
went down to the sea to drown herself, that her body might be eaten by the 
monsters of the sea. When she came to the shell-covered beach, she sat down 
and sang her death song-

"I weep, I call to the steep billows of the sea
And to him, the great, the ocean god;
To monsters, all now hidden,
To come and bury me,
Who now am wrapped in mourning.
Let the waves wear their mourning, too,
And sleep as sleeps the dead."

-Ancient Maui Chant of New Zealand.

Then Hina-uri threw herself into the sea and was borne on the waves many 
moons, at last drifting to shore, to be found by two fishermen. They carried 
the body off to the fire and warmed it back to life. They brushed off the 
sea moss and sea weeds and rubbed her until she awoke.

Soon they told their chief, Tini-rau, what a beautiful woman they had found 
in the sea. He came and took her away to make her one of his wives. But the 
other wives were jealous and drove Hina-uri away from the chief's houses.

Another New Zealand legend says that Hina came to the sea and called for a 
little fish to aid her in going away from the island. It tried to carry her, 
but was too weak. Hina struck it with her open hand. It had striped sides 
forever after. She tried a larger fish, but fell off before they had gone 
far from shore. Her blow gave this fish its beautiful blue spots. Another 
received black spots. Another she stamped her foot upon, making it flat. At 
last a shark carried her far away. She was very thirsty, and broke a 
cocoanut on the shark's head, making a bump, which has been handed down for 
generations. The shark carried her to the home of the two who rescued her 
and gave her new strength.

Meanwhile Rupe or Maui-mua, a brother of Hinauri and Maui, grieved for his 
sister. He sought for her throughout the land and then launched his canoe 
upon the blue waters surrounding Ao-tea-roa (The Great White Land; the 
ancient native New Zealand) and searched the coasts. He only learned that 
his sister had, as the natives said, "leaped into the waters and been 
carried away into the heavens."

Rupe's heart filled with the desire to find and protect the frenzied sister 
who had probably taken a canoe and floated away, out of the horizon, seen 
from New Zealand coasts, into new horizons. During the Viking age of the 
Pacific, when many chiefs sailed long distances, visiting the most remote 
islands of Polynesia, they frequently spoke of breaking through from the 
home land into new heavens-or of climbing up the path of the sun on the 
waters into a new heaven. This was their poetical way of passing from 
horizon to horizon. The horizon around their particular island surrounded 
their complete world. Outside, somewhere, were other worlds and other 
heavens. Rupe's voyage was an idyll of the Pacific. It was one more story to 
be added to the prose poems of consecrated travel. It was a brother feeling 
through the mysteries of unknown lands for a sister, as dear to him as an 
Evangeline has been to other men.

From the mist-land of the Polynesian race comes this story of the trickery 
of Maui the learned, and the faithfulness of his older brother Maui-mua or 
Rupe-one of the "five forgetful Mauis." Rupe hoisted mat-sails over his 
canoe and thus made the winds serve him. He paddled the canoe onward through 
the hotlis when calms rested on glassy waves.

Thus he passed out of sight of Ao-tea-roa, away from his brothers, and out 
of the reach of all tricks and incantations of Maui, the mischievous. He 
sailed until a new island rose out of the sea to greet him. Here in a "new 
heaven" he found friends to care for him and prepare him for his longer 
journey. His restless anxiety for his sister urged him onward until days 
lengthened into months and months into years. He passed from the horizons of 
newly-discovered islands, into the horizons of circling skies around islands 
of which he had never heard before. Sometimes he found relatives, but more 
frequently his welcome came from those who could trace no historical touch 
in their genealogies.

Here and there, apparently, he found traces of a woman whose description 
answered that of his sister Hina-uri. At last he looked through the heavens 
upon a new world, and saw his sister in great trouble.

According to some legends the jealous wives of the great chief, Tini-rau, 
attack Hina, who was known among them as Hina-te-ngaru-moana, "Hina, the 
daughter of the ocean." Tini-rau and Hina lived away from the village of the 
chief until their little boy was born. When they needed food, the chief 
said, "Let us go to my settlement and we shall have food provided."

But Hina chanted:

"Let it down, let it down,
Descend, oh! descend-"

and sufficient food fell before them. After a time their frail clothing wore 
out, and the cold chilled them, then Hina again uttered the incantation and 
clothing was provided for their need.

But the jealous wives, two in number, finally heard where Hina and the chief 
were living, and started to see them.

Tini-rau said to Hina, "Here come my other wives-be careful how you act 
before them."

She replied, "If they come in anger it will be evil."

She armed herself with an obsidian or volcanic-glass knife, and waited their 
coming.

They tried to throw enchantments around her to, kill her. Then one of them 
made a blow at her with a weapon, but she turned it aside and killed her 
enemy with the obsidian knife.

Then the other wife made an attack, and again the obsidian knife brought 
death. She ripped open the stomachs of the jealous ones and showed the chief 
fish lines and sinkers and other property which they had eaten in the past 
and which Tini-rau had never been able to trace.

Another legend says that the two women came to kill Hina when they heard of 
the birth of her boy. For a time she was greatly terrified. Then she saw 
that they were coming from different directions. She attacked the nearest 
one with a stone and killed her. The body burst open, and was seen to be 
full of green stone. Then she killed the second wife in the same way, and 
found more green stones. "Thus, according to the legends, originated the 
greenstone" from which the choicest and most valuable stone tools have since 
been made. For a time the chief and Hina lived happily together. Then he 
began to neglect her and abuse her, until she cried aloud for her brother-

"O Rupe! come down.
Take me and my child."

Rupe assumed the form of a bird and flew down to this world in which he had 
found his sister. He chanted as he came down-

"It is Rupe, yes Rupe,
The elder brother;
And I am here."

He folded the mother and her boy under his wings and flew away with them. 
Sir George Gray relates a legend in which Maui-mua or Rupe is recorde as 
having carried his sister and her child to one of the new lands, found in 
his long voyage, where dwelt an aged relative, of chief rank, with his 
retainers.

Some legends say that Tini-rau tried to catch Rupe, who was compelled to 
drop the child in order to escape with the mother. Tini-rau caught the child 
and carefully cared for him until he grew to be a strong young lad.

Then he wanted to find his mother and bring her back to his father. How this 
was done, how Rupe took his sister back to the old chief, and how civil wars 
arose are not all these told in the legends of the Maoris. Thus the tricks 
of Maui the mischievous brought trouble for a time, but were finally 
overshadowed by happy homes in neighboring lands for his suffering sister 
and her descendants.

IX.
MAUI'S KITE FLYING.
MAUI the demi-god was sometimes the Hercules of Polynesia. His exploits were 
fully as marvelous as those of the hero of classic mythology. He snared the 
sun. He pulled up islands from the ocean depths. He lifted the sky into its 
present position and smoothed its arched surface with his stone adze. These 
stories belong to all Polynesia.

There are numerous less important local myths, some of them peculiar to New 
Zealand, some to the Society Islands and some to the Hawaiian group.

One of the old native Hawaiians says that in the long, long ago the birds 
were flying around the homes of the ancient people. The flutter of their 
wings could be heard and the leaves and branches moved when the motion of 
the wings ceased and the wanderers through the air found resting places. 
Then came sweet music from the trees and the people marvelled. Only one of 
all mankind could see the winged warblers. Maui, the demi-god, had clear 
vision. The swift-flying wings covered with red or gold he saw. The throats 
tinted many colors and reflecting the sunlight with diamond sparks of varied 
hues he watched while they trembled with the melody of sweet bird songs. All 
others heard but did not see. They were blind and yet had open vision.

Sometimes the iiwi (a small red bird) fluttered in the air and uttered its 
shrill, happy song, and Maui saw and heard. But the bird at that time was 
without color in the eyes of the ancient people and only the clear voice was 
heard, while no speck of bird life flecked the clear sky overhead.

At one time a god from one of the other islands came to visit Maui. Each 
boasted of and described the beauties and nierits of his island. While they 
were conversing, Maui called for his friends the birds. They gathered around 
the house and fluttered among the leaves of the surrounding trees. Soon 
their sweet voices filled the air on all sides. All the people wondered and 
worshiped, thinking they heard the fairy or menchune people. It was said 
that Maui had painted the bodies of his invisible songsters and for a long 
time had kept the delight of their flashing colors to himself. But when the 
visitor had rejoiced in the mysterious harmonies, Maui decided to take away 
whatever veil shut out the sight of these things beautiful, that his bird 
friends might be known and honored ever after. So he made the birds reveal 
themselves perched in the trees or flying in the air. The clear eyes of the 
god first recognized the new revelation, then all the people became dumb 
before the sweet singers adorned in all their brilliant tropical plumage.

The beautiful red birds, iiwi and akakani, and the birds of glorious yellow 
feathers, the oo and the mamo, were a joy to both eye and ear and found high 
places in Hawaiian legend and story, and all gave their most beautiful 
feathers for the cloaks and helmets of the chiefs.

The Maoris of New Zealand say that Maui could at will change himself into a 
bird and with his feathered friends find a home in leafy shelters. In bird 
form he visited the gods of the under-world. His capricious soul was 
sensitive to the touch of all that mysterious life of nature.

With the birds as companions and the winds as his servants Maui must soon 
have turned his inventive mind to kite making.

The Hawaiian myths are perhaps the only ones of the Pacific Ocean which give 
to any of the gods the pleasure and excitement of kite flying. Maui, after 
repeated experiments, made a large kite for himself. It was much larger than 
any house of his time or generation. He twisted a long line from the strong 
fibers of the native plant known as the olona. He endowed both kite and 
string with marvelous powers and launched the kite up toward the clouds. It 
rose very slowly. The winds were not lifting it into the sky.

Maui remembered that an old priest lived in Waipio valley, the largest and 
finest valley of the large island, Hawaii, on which he made his home.

This priest had a covered calabash in which he compelled the winds to hide 
when he did not wish them to play on land and sea. The priest's name was 
Kaleiioku, and his calabash was known as ipu-makania ka maumau, "the 
calabash of the perpetual winds." Maui called for the priest who had charge 
of the winds to open his calabash and let them come up to Hilo and blow 
along the Wailuku river. The natives say that the place where Maui stood was 
marked by the pressure of his feet in the lava rocks of the river bank as he 
braced himself to hold the kite against the increasing force of the winds 
which pushed it towards the sky. Then the enthusiasm of kite flying filled 
his youthful soul and he cried aloud, screaming his challenge along the 
coast of the sea toward Waipio-

"O winds, winds of Waipio,
In the calabash of Kaleiioku.
Come from the ipu-makard,
O wind, the wind of Hilo,
Come quickly, come with power."

Then the priest lifted the cover of the calabash of the winds and let the 
strong winds of Hilo escape. Along the sea coast they rushed until as they 
entered Hilo Bay they heard the voice of Maui calling-

"O winds, winds of Hilo,
Hasten and conle to me."

With a tumultuous rush the strong winds turned toward the mountains. They 
forced their way along the gorges and palisades of the Wailuku river. They 
leaped into the heavens, making a fierce attack upon the monster which Maui 
had sent into the sky. The kite struggled as it was pushed upward by the 
hands of the fierce winds, but Maui rejoiced. His heart was uplifted by the 
joy of the conflict in which his strength to hold was pitted against the 
power of the winds to tear away. And again he shouted toward the sea-

"O winds, the winds of Hilo,
Come to the mountains, come."

The winds which had been stirring up storms on the face of the waters came 
inland. They dashed against Maui. They climbed the heights of the skies 
until they fell with full violence against their mighty foe hanging in the 
heavens.

The kite had been made of the strongest kapa (paper cloth) which Maui's 
mother could prepare. It was not torn, although it was bent backward to its 
utmost limit. Then the strain came on the strong cord of olona fibre. The 
line was stretched and strained as the kite was pushed back. Then Maui 
called again and again for stronger winds to come. The cord was drawn out 
until the kite was far above the mountains. At last it broke and the kite 
was tossed over the craters of the volcanoes to the land of the district of 
Ka-u on the other side of the island.

Then Maui was angry and hastily leaped over the mountains, which are nearly 
fourteen thousand feet in altitude. In a half dozen strides he had crossed 
the fifty or sixty miles from his home to the place where the kite lay. He 
could pass over many miles with a single step. His narne was Maui-Mama, 
"Maui the Swift." When Maui returned with his kite he was more careful in 
calling the winds to aid him in his sport.

The people watched their wise neighbor and soon learned that the kite could 
be a great blessing to them. When it was soaring in the sky there was always 
dry and pleasant weather. It was a day for great rejoicing. They could 
spread out their kapa cloth to dry as long as the kite was in the sky. They 
could carry out their necessary work without fear of the rain. Therefore 
when any one saw the kite beginning to float along the mountain side he 
would call out joyfully, "E! Maui's kite is in the heavens." Maui would send 
his kite into the blue sky and then tie the line to the great black stones 
in the bed of the Wailuku river.

Maui soon learned the power of his kite when blown upon by a fierce wind. 
With his accustomed skill he planned to make use of his strong servant, and 
therefore took the kite with him on hisjourneys to the other islands, using 
it to aid in making swift voyages. With the wind in the right direction, the 
kite could pull his double canoe very easily and quickly to its destination.

Time passed, and even the demi-god died. The fish hook with which he drew 
the Hawaiian Islands up from the depths of the sea was allowed to lie on the 
lava by the Wailuku river until it became a part of the stone. The double 
canoe was carried far inland and then permitted to petrify by the river 
side. The two stones which represent the double canoe now bear the name 
"Waa-Kauhi," and the kite has fallen from the sky far up on the mountain 
side, where it still rests, a flat plot of rich land between Mauna Kea and 
Mauna Loa.

X.
THE OAHU LEGENDS OF MAUI.
SEVERAL Maui legends have been located on the island of Oahu. They were 
given by Mr. Kaaia to Mr. T. G. Thrum, the publisher of what is well known 
in the Hawaiian Islands as "Thrum's Annual." He has kindly furnished them 
for added interest to the present volume. The legends have a distinctly 
local flavor confined entirely to Oahu. It has seemed best to reserve them 
for a chapter by themselves although they are chiefly variations of stories 
already told.

MAUI AND THE TWO GODS.

This history of Maui and his grandmother Hina begins with their arrival from 
foreign lands. They dwelt in Kane-ana (Kane's cave), Waianae, Oahu. This is 
an "ana," or cave, at Puu-o-hulu. Hina had wonderful skill in making all 
kinds of tapa according to the custom of the women of ancient Hawaii.

Maui went to the Koolau side and rested at Kaha-luu, a diving place in 
Koolaupoko. In that place there is a noted hill called Ma-eli-eli. This is 
the story of that hill. Maui threw up a pile of dirt and concealed rubbish 
under it. The two gods, Kane and Kanaloa, came along and asked Maui what he 
was doing. He said, "What you see. You two dig on that side to the foot of 
the pali, (precipice) and I will go down at Kaha-luu. If you two dig through 
first, you may kill me. If I get through first I will kill you," They 
agreed, and began to dig and throw up the dirt. Then Maui dug three times 
and tossed up some of the hills of that place. Kane and Kanaloa saw that 
Maui was digging very fast, so they put forth very great strength and threw 
the dirt into a hill. Meanwhile Maui ran away to the other side of the 
island. Thus by the aid of the gods the hill Ala-eli-eli was thrown up and 
received its name "eli," meaning "dig." "Ma-eli-eli" meant "the place of 
digging."

HOW THEY FOUND FIRE.

It was said that Maui and Hina had no fire. They where often cold and had no 
cooked food. Maui saw flames rising in a distant place and ran to see how 
they were made. When he came to that place the fire was out and some birds 
flew away. One of them was Ka-Alae-huapi, "the stingy Alae"-a small duck, 
the Hawaiian mud hen. Maui watched again and saw fire. When he went up the 
birds saw him coming and scattered the fire, carrying the ashes into the 
water; but he leaped and caught the little Alae. "Ali!" he said, "I will 
kill you, because you do not let me have fire." The bird replied, "If you 
kill me you cannot find fire." Maui said, "Where is fire?" The Alae said, 
"Go up on the high land where beautiful plants with large leaves are 
standing; rub their branches." Maui set the bird free and went inland from 
Halawa and found dry land taro. He began to rub the stalks, but only juice 
came out like water. He had no red fire. He was very angry and said, "If 
that lying Alae is caught again by me I will be its death."

After a while he saw the fire burning and ran swiftly. The birds saw him and 
cried, "The cooking is over. Here comes the swift grandchild of Hina." They 
scattered the fire; threw the ashes away and flew into the water. But again 
Maui caught the Alae and began to kill it, saying: "You gave me a plant full 
of water from which to get fire." The bird said, "If I die you can never 
find fire. I will give you the secret of fire. Take a branch of that dry 
tree and rub." Maui held the bird fast in one hand while he rubbed with the 
other until smoke and fire came out. Then he took the fire stick and rubbed 
the head of the bird, making a place where red and white feathers have grown 
ever since.

He returned to Hina and taught her how to make fire, using the two fire 
sticks and how to twist coconut fibre to catch the fire when it had been 
kindled in wood. But the Alae was not forgotten. It was called huapi, 
"stingy," because it selfishly kept the knowledge of fire making to itself.

MAUI CATCHING THE SUN.

Maui watched Hina making tapa. The wet tapa was spread on a long tapa board, 
and Hina began at one end to pound it into shape; pounding from one end to 
another. He noticed that sunset came by the time she had pounded to the 
middle of the board. The sun hurried so fast that she could only begin her 
work before the day was past.

He went to the hill Hele-a-ka-la, which means "journey of the sun." He 
thought he would catch the sun and make it miove slowly. He went up the hill 
and waited. When the sun began to rise, Maui made himself long, stretching 
up toward the sky. Soon the shining legs of the sun came up the hillside. He 
saw Maui and began to run swiftly, but Maui reached out and caught one of 
the legs, saying: "O sun, I will kill you. You are a mischief maker. You 
make trouble for Hina by going so fast." Then he broke the shining leg of 
the sun. The sufferer said, "I will change my way and go slowly-six months 
slow and six months faster." Thus arose the saying, "Long shall be the daily 
journey of the sun and he shall give light for all the people's toil." Hina 
learned that she could pound until she was tired while the farmers could 
plant and take care of their fields. Thus also this hill received its name 
Hele-a-ka-la. This is one of the hills of Waianae near the precipice of the 
hill Puu-o-hulu.

UNITING THE ISLANDS.

Maui suggested to Hina that he had better try to draw the islands together, 
uniting them in one land. Hina told Maui to go and see Alae-nui-a-Hina, who 
would tell him what to do. The Alae told him they must go to Ponaha-ke-one 
(a fishing place outside of Pearl Harbor) and find Ka-uniho-kahi, "the one 
toothed," who held the land under the sea.

Maui went back to Hina. She told him to ask his brothers to go fishing with 
him. They consented and pushed out into the sea. Soon Maui saw a bailing 
dish floating by the canoe and picked it up. It was named Hina-a-ke-ka, 
"Hina who fell off." They paddled to Ponaha-ke-one. When they stopped they 
saw, a beautiful young wornan in the boat. Then they anchored and again 
looked in the boat, but the young woman was gone. They saw the bailing dish 
and, threw it into the sea.

Maui-mua threw his hook and caught a large fish, which was seen to be a 
shark as they drew it to the surface. At once they cut the line. So also 
Mauihope and Maui-waena. At last Maui threw his hook Manai-i-ka-lani into 
the sea. It went down, down into the depths. Maui cried, "Hina-a-ke-ka has 
my hook in her hand. By her it will be made fast." Hina went down with the 
hook until she met Ka-uniho-kahi. She asked him to open his mouth, then 
threw the hook far inside and made it fast. Then she pulled the line so that 
Maui should know that the fish was caught. Maui fastened the line to the 
outrigger of the canoe and asked his brothers to paddle with all diligence, 
and not look back. Long, long, they paddled and were very tired. Then Maui 
took a paddle and dipped deep in the sea. The boat moved more swiftly 
through the sea. The brothers looked back and cried, "There is plenty of 
land behind us." The charm was broken. The hook came out of "the one 
toothed," and the raised islands sank back into their place. The native say, 
"The islands are now united to America. Perhaps Maui has been at work."

MAUI AND PEA-PEA THE EIGHT-EYED.

Maui had been fishing and had caught a great fish upon which he was 
feasting. He looked inland and saw his wife, Kumu-lama, seized and carried 
away by Pea-pea-maka-walu, "Pea-pea the eight-eyed." This is a legend 
derived from the myths of many islands in which Lupe or Rupe (pigeon) 
changed himself into a bird and flew after his sister Hina who had been 
carried on the back of a shark to distant islands. Sometimes as a man and 
sometimes as a bird he prosecuted his search until Hina was found.

Maui pursued Pea-pea, but could not catch him. He carried Maui's wife over 
the sea to a far away island. Maui was greatly troubled but his grandmother 
sent him inland to find an old man who would tell him what to do. Maui went 
inland and looking down toward Waipahu saw this man Ku-olo-kele. He was 
hump-backed. Maui threw a large stone and hit the "hill on the back" knocked 
it off and made the back straight. The old man lifted up the stone and threw 
it to Waipahu, where it lies to this day. Then he and Maui talked together. 
He told Maui to go and catch birds and gather ti leaves and fibers of the 
ie-ie vine, and fill his house. These things Maui secured and brought to 
him. He told Maui to go home and return after three days.

Ku-olo-kele took the ti leaves and the ie-ie threads and made the body of a 
great bird which he covered with bird feathers. He fastened all together 
with the ie-ie. This was done in the first day. The second day he placed 
food inside and tried his bird and it flew all right. "Thus," as the 
Hawaiians say, "the first flying ship was made in the time of Maui." This is 
a modern version of Rupe changing himself into a bird.

On the third day Maui came and saw the wonderful bird body thoroughly 
prepared for his journey. Maui went inside. Ku-olo-kele said, "When you 
reach that land, look for a village. If the people are not there look to the 
beach. If there are many people, your wife and Pea-pea the eight-eyed will 
be there. Do not go near, but fly out over the sea. The people will say, 'O, 
the strange bird;' but Pea-pea will say, 'This is my bird. It is tabu.' You 
can then come to the people."

Maui pulled the ie-ie ropes fastened to the wings and made them move. Thus 
he flew away into the sky. Two days was his journey before he came to that 
strange island, Moana-liha-i-ka-wao-kele. It was a beautiful land. He flew 
inland to a village, but there were no people; according to the ancient 
chant:

"The houses of Lima-loa stand,
But there are no people;
They are at Mana."

The people were by the sea. Maui flew over them. He saw his wife, but he 
passed on flying out over the sea, skimming like a sea bird down to the 
water and rising gracefully up to the sky. Pea-pea called out, "This is my 
bird. It is tabu." Maui heard and came to the beach. He was caught and 
placed in a tabu box. The servants carried him, up to the village and put 
him in the chief's sleeping house, when Pea-pea and his people returned to 
their homes.

In the night Pea-pea and Maui's wife lay down to sleep. Maui watched Pea-
pea, hoping that he would soon sleep. Then he would kill him. Maui waited. 
One eye was closed, seven eyes were opened. Then four eyes closed, leaving 
three. The night was almost past and dawn was near. Then Maui called to Hina 
with his spirit voice, "O Hina, keep it dark." Hina made the gray dawn dark 
in the three eyes and two closed in sleep. The last eye was weary, and it 
also slept. Then Maui went out of the bird body and cut off the head of Pea-
pea and put it inside the bird. He broke the roof of the house until a large 
opening was made. He took his wife, Kumu-lama, and flew away to the island 
of Oahu. The winds blew hard against the flying bird. Rain fell in torrents 
around it, but those inside had no trouble.

"Thus Maui returned with his wife to his home in Oahu. The story is pau 
(finished)."

XI.
MAUI SEEKING IMMORTALITY.
Climb up, climb up,
To the highest surface of heaven,
To all the sides of heaven.

Climb then to thy ancestor,
The sacred bird in the sky,
To thy ancestor Rehua

In the heavens.

-New Zealand kite incantation.

THE story of Maui seeking immortality for the human race is one of the 
finest myths in the world. For pure imagination and pathos it is difficult 
to find any tale from Grecian or Latin literature to compare with it. In 
Greek and Roman fables gods suffered for other gods, and yet none were 
surrounded with such absolutely mythical experiences as those through which 
the demi-god Maui of the Pacific Ocean passed when he entered the gates of 
death with the hope of winning immortality for mankind. The really 
remarkable group of legends which cluster around Maui is well concluded by 
the story of his unselfish and heroic battle with death.

The different islands of the Pacific have their Hades, or abode of dead. It 
is, with very few exceptions, down in the interior of the earth. Sometimes 
the tunnels left by currents of melted lava are the passages into the home 
of departed spirits. In Samoa there are two circular holes among the rocks 
at the west end of the island Savaii. These are the entrances to the under-
world for chiefs and people. The spirits of those who die on the other 
islands leap into the sea and swim around the land from island to island 
until they reach Savaii. Then they plunge down into their heaven or their 
hades.

The Tongans had a spirit island for the horne of the dead. They said that 
some natives once sailed far away in a canoe and found this island. It was 
covered with all manner of beautiful fruits, amongwhich rare birds sported. 
They landed, but the trees were shadows. They grasped but could not hold 
them. The fruits and the birds were shadows. The men ate, but swallowed 
nothing substantial. It was shadow-land. They walked through all the 
delights their eyes looked upon, but found no substance. They returned home, 
but ever seemed to listen to spirits calling them back to the island. In a 
short time all the voyagers were dead.

There is no escape from death. The natives of New Zealand say: "Man may have 
descendants, but the daughters of the night strangle his offspring"; and 
again: "Men make heroes, but death carries them away."

There are very few legends among the Polynesians concerning the death of 
Maui. And these are usually fragmentary, except among the Maoris of New 
Zealand.

The Hawaiian legend of the death of Maui is to the effect that he offended 
some of the greater gods living in Waipio valley on the Island of Hawaii. 
Kanaloa, one of the four greatest gods of Hawaii, seized him and dashed him 
against the rocks. His blood burst from, the body and colored the earth red 
in the upper part of the valley. The Hawaiians in another legend say that 
Maui was chasing a boy and girl in Honolii gulch, Hawaii. The girl climbed a 
breadfruit tree. Maui changed himself into an eel and stretched himself 
along the side of the trunk of the tree. The tree stretched itself upward 
and Maui failed to reach the girl. A priest came along and struck the eel 
and killed it, and so Maui died. This is evidently a changed form of the 
legend of Maui and the long eel. Another Hawaiian fragment approaches very 
near to the beautiful New Zealand myth. The Hawaiians said that Maui 
attempted to tear a motintain apart. He wrenched a great hole in the side. 
Then the elepaio bird sang and the charm was broken. The cleft in the 
mountain could not be enlarged. If the story could be completed it would not 
be strange if the death of Maui came with this failure to open the path 
through the mountain.

The Hervey Islands say that after Maui fished up the islands his hook was 
thrown into the heavens and became the curved tail of the constellation of 
stars which we know as "The Scorpion." Then the people became angry with 
Maui and threw him up into the sky and his body is still thought to be 
hanging among the stars of the scorpion.

The Samoans, according to Turner, say that Maui went fishing and tried to 
catch the land under the seas and pull it to the surface. Finally an island 
appeared, but the people living on it were angry with Maui and drove him 
away into the heavens.

As he leaped from the island it separated into two parts. Thus the Samoans 
account for the origin of two of their islands and also for the passing away 
of Maui from the earth.

The natives of New Zealand have many myths concerning the death of Maui. 
Each tribe tells the story with such variations as would be expected when 
the fact is noted that these tribes have preserved their individuality 
through many generations. The substance of the myth, however, is the same.

In Maui's last days he longed for the victory over death. His innate love of 
life led him to face the possibility of escaping and overcoming the 
relentless enemy of mankind and thus bestow the boon of deathlessness upon 
his fellow-men. He had been successful over and over again in his contests 
with both gods and men. When man was created, he stood erect, but, according 
to an Hawaiian myth, had jointless arms and limbs. A web of skin connected 
and fastened tightly the arms to the body and the legs to each other. "Maui 
was angry at this motionless statue and took him and broke his legs at 
ankle, knee and hip and then, tearing them and the arms from the body, 
destroyed the web. Then he broke the arms at the elbow and shoulder. Then 
man could move from place to place, but he had neither fingers or toes." 
Here comes the most ancient Polynesian statement of the theory of evolution: 
"Hunger impelled man to seek his food in the mountains, where his toes were 
cut out by the brambles in climbing, and his fingers were also formed by the 
sharp splinters of the bamboo while searching with his arms for food in the 
ground."

It was not strange that Maui should feel self-confident when considering the 
struggle for immortality as a gift to be bestowed upon mankind. And yet his 
father warned him that his time of failure would surely come.

White, who has collected many of the myths and legends of New Zealand, 
states that after Maui had ill-treated Mahu-ika, his grandmother, the 
goddess and guardian of fire in the under-world, his father and mother tried 
to teach him to do differently. But he refused to listen. Then the father 
said:

"You heard our instructions, but please yourself and persist for life or 
death."

Maui replied: "What do I care? Do you think I shall cease? Rather I will 
persist forever and ever."

Then his father said: "There is one so powerful that no tricks can be of any 
avail."

Maui asked: "By what shall I be overcome?" The answer was that one of his 
ancestors, Hine-nui-te-po (Great Hine of the night), the guardian of life, 
would overcome him.

When Maui fished islands out of the deep seas, it was said that Hine made 
her home on the outer edge of one of the outermost islands. There the glow 
of the setting sun lighted the thatch of her house and covered it with 
glorious colors. There Great Hine herself stood flashing and sparkling on 
the edge of the horizon.

Maui, in these last days of his life, looked toward the west and said: "Let 
us investigate this matter and learn whether life or death shall follow."

The father replied: "There is evil hanging over you. When I chanted the 
invocation of your childhood, when you were made sacred and guarded by 
charms, I forgot a part of the ceremony. And for this you are to die."

Then Maui said, "Will this be by Hine-nui-te-po? What is she like?"

The father said that the flashing eyes they could see in the distance were 
dark as greenstone, the teeth were as sharp as volcanic glass, her mouth was 
large like a fish, and her hair was floating in the air like sea-weed.

One of the legends of New Zealand says that Maui and his brothers went 
toward the west, to the edge of the horizon, where they saw the goddess of 
the night. Light was flashing from her body. Here they found a great pit-the 
home of night. Maui entered the pit-telling his brothers not to laugh. He 
passed through and turning about started to return. The brothers laughed and 
the walls of night closed in around him and held him till he died.

The longer legend tells how Maui after his conversation with his father, 
remembered his conflict with the moon. He had tied her so that she could not 
escape, but was compelled to bathe in the waters of life and return night 
after night lest men should be in darkness when evening came.

Maui said to the goddess of the moon: "Let death be short. As the moon dies 
and returns with strength, so let men die and revive again."

But she replied: "Let death be very long, that man may sigh and sorrow. When 
man dies, let him go into darkness, become like earth, that those he leaves 
behind may weep and wail and mourn." according

Maui did not lay aside his purpose, but according to the New Zealand story, 
"did not wish men to die but to live forever. Death appeared degrading and 
an insult to the dignity of man. Man ought to die like the moon, which dips 
in the life-giving waters of Kane and is renewed again, or like the sun, 
which daily sinks into the pit of night and with renewed strength rises in 
the morning."

Maui sought the home of Hine-nui-te-po-the guardian of life. He heard her 
order her attendants to watch for any one approaching and capture all who 
came walking upright as a man. He crept past the attendants on hands and 
feet, found the place of life, stole some of the food of the goddess and 
returned home. He showed the food to his brothers and persuaded them to go 
with him into the darkness of the night of death. On the way he changed them 
into the form of birds. In the evening they came to the house of the goddess 
on the island long before fished up from the seas.

Maui warned the birds to refrain from making any noise -while he made the 
supreme effort of his life. He was about to enter upon his struggle for 
immortality. He said to the birds: "If I go into the stomach of this woman, 
do not laugh until I have gone through her, and come out again at her month; 
then you can laugh at me."

His friends said: "You will be killed." Maui replied: "If you laugh at me 
when I have only entered her stomach I shall be killed, but if I have passed 
through her and come out of her mouth I shall escape and Hine-nui-te-po will 
die."

His friends called out to him: "Go then. The decision is with you."

Hine was sleeping soundly. The flashes of lightning had all ceased. The 
sunlight had almost passed away and the house lay in quiet gloom. Maui came 
near to the sleeping goddess. Her large, fish-like mouth was open wide. He 
put off his clothing and prepared to pass through the ordeal of going to the 
hidden source of life, to tear it out of the body of its guardian and carry 
it back with him, to mankind. He stood in all the glory of savage manhood. 
His body was splendidly marked by the tattoo-bones, and now well oiled shone 
and sparkled in the last rays of the setting sun.

He leaped through the mouth of the enchanted one and entered her stomach, 
weapon in band, to take out her heart, the vital principle which he knew had 
its home somewhere within her being. He found immortality on the other side 
of death. He turned to come back again into life when suddenly a little bird 
(the Pata-tai) laughed in a clear, shrill tone, and Great Hine, through 
whose mouth Maui was passing, awoke. Her sharp, obsidian teeth closed with a 
snap upon Maui, cutting his body in the center. Thus Maui entered the gates 
of death, but was unable to return, and death has ever since been victor 
over rebellious men. The natives have the saying:

"If Maui had not died, he could have restored to life all who had gone 
before him, and thus succeeded in destroying death."

Maui's brothers took the dismembered body and buried it in a cave called Te-
ana-i-hana, "The cave dug out," possibly a prepared burial place.

Maui's wife made war upon the spirits, the gods, and killed as many as she 
could to avenge her husband's death. One of the old native poets of New 
Zealand, in chanting the story to Mr. White, said: "But though Maui was 
killed, his offspring survived. Some of these are at Hawa-i-i-ki and some at 
Aotearoa (New Zealand), but the greater part of them remained at Hawa-i-ki. 
This history was handed down by the generations of our ancestors of ancient 
times, and we continue to rehearse it to our children, with our incantations 
and genealogies, and all other matters relating to our race."

"But death is nothing new,
Death is, and has been ever since old Maui died.
Then Pata-tai laughed loud
And woke the goblin-god,
Who severed him in two, and shut him in,
So dusk of eve came on."

-Maori death chant, New Zealand.

XII.
HINA OF HILO.
HINA is not an uncommon name in Hawaiian genealogies. It is usually 
accompanied by some adjective which explains or identifies the person to 
whom the name is given. In Hawaii the name Hina is feminine. This is also 
true throughout all Polynesia except in a few cases where Hina is reckoned 
as a man with supernatural attributes. Even in these cases it is apparent 
that the legend has been changed from its original form as it has been 
carried to small islands by comparatively ignorant people when moving away 
from their former homes.

Hina is a Polynesian goddess whose story is very interesting-one worthy of 
study when comparing the legends of the island groups of the Pacific. The 
Hina of Hilo is the same as the goddess of that name most widely known 
throughout Polynesia-and yet her legends are located by the ancient 
Hawaiians in Hilo, as if that place were her only home. The legends are so 
old that the Hawaiians have forgotten their origin in other lands. The 
stories were brought with the immigrants who settled on the Hilo coast. Thus 
the stories found their final location with the families who brought them. 
There are three Hawaiian Hinas practically distinct from each other, 
although a supernatural element is connected with each one. Hina who was 
stolen from Hawaii by a chief of the Island of Molokai was an historical 
character, although surrounded by mythical stories. Another Hina, who was 
the wife of Kuula, the fish god, was pre-eminently a local deity, having no 
real connection with the legends of the other islands of the Pacific, 
athough sometimes the stories told concerning her have not been kept 
entirely distinct from the legends of the Hina of Hilo.

The Hilo Hina was the true legendary character closely connected with all 
Polynesia. The stories about her are of value not simply as legends, but as 
traditions closely uniting the Hawaiian Islands with the island groups 
thousands of miles distant. The Wailuku river, which flows through the town 
of Hilo, has its own peculiar and weird beauty. For miles it is a series of 
waterfalls and rapids. It follows the course of an ancient lava flow, 
sometimes forcing its way under bridges of lava, thus forming what are 
called boiling pots, and sometimes pouring in massive sheets over the edges 
of precipices which never disintegrate. By the side of this river Hina's 
son,Maui had his lands. In the very bed of the river, in a cave under one of 
the largest falls, Hina made her own home, concealed from the world by the 
silver veil of falling water and lulled to sleep by the continual roar of 
the flood falling into the deep pool below. By the side of this river, the 
legends say, she pounded her tapa and prepared her food. Here were the 
small, graceful mamake and the coarser wauke trees, from which the bark was 
stripped with which she made tapa cloth. Branches were cut or broken from 
these and other trees whose bark was fit for the purpose. These branches 
were well soaked until the bark was removed easily. Then the outer bark was 
scraped off, leaving only the pliable inner bark. The days were very short 
and there was no time for rest while making tapa cloth. Therefore, as soon 
as the morning light reddened the clouds, Hina would take her calabash 
filled with water to pour upon the bark, and her little bundle of round 
clubs (the hohoa) and her four-sided mallets (the i-e-kuku) and hasten to 
the sacred spot where, with chants and incantations, the tapa was made.

The bark was well soaked in the water all the days of the process of tapa 
making. Hina took small bundles of the wet inner bark and laid them on the 
kua or heavy tapa board, pounding them together into a pulpy mass with her 
round clubs. Then using the four-sided mallets, she beat this pulp into thin 
sheets. Beautiful tapa, soft as silk, was made by adding pulpy mass to pulpy 
mass and beating it day after day until the fibres were lost and a sheet of 
close-woven bark cloth was formed. Although Hina was a goddess and had a 
family possessing miraculous power, it never entered the mind of the 
Hawaiian legend tellers to endow her with case in producing wonderful 
results. The legends of the Southern Pacific Islands show more imagination. 
They say that Ina (Hina) was such a wonderful artist in making beautiful 
tapas that she was placed in the skies, where she beat out glistening fine 
tapas, the white and glorious clouds. When she stretches these clouds sheets 
out to dry, she places stones along the edges, so that the fierce winds of 
the heavens shall not blow them away. When she throws these stones aside, 
the skies reverberate with thunder. When she rolls her cloud sheets of tapa 
together, the folds glisten with flashes of light and lightning leaps from 
sheet to sheet.

The Hina of Hilo was grieved as she toiled because after she had pounded the 
sheets out so thin that they were ready to be dried, she found it almost 
impossible to secure the necessary aid of the sun in the drying process. She 
would rise as soon as she could see and hasten to spread out the tapa made 
the day before. But the sun always hurried so fast that the sheets could not 
dry. He leaped from the ocean waters in the earth, rushed across the heavens 
and plunged into the dark waters again on the other side of the island 
before she could even turn her tapas so that they might dry evenly. This 
legend of very short days is strange because of its place not only among the 
myths of Hawaii but also because it belongs to practically all the tropical 
islands of the Pacific Ocean. In Tahiti the legends said that the sun rushed 
across the sky very rapidly. The days were too short for fruits to ripen or 
for work to be finished. In Samoa the "mats" made by Sina had no time to 
dry. The ancestors of the Polynesians sometime somewhere must have been in 
the region of short days and long nights. Hina found that her incantations 
had no influence with the sun. She could not prevail upon him to go slower 
and give her more time for the completion of her task. Then she called on 
her powerful son, Maui-ki-i-ki-i, for aid.

Some of the legends of the Island Maui say that Hina dwelt by the sea coast 
of that island near the high hill Kauwiki at the foot of the great mountain 
Haleakala, House of the Sun, and that there, facing the southern skies under 
the most favorable conditions for making tapa, she found the days too short 
for the tapa to dry. At the present time the Hawaiians point out a Iong, 
narrow stone not far from the surf and almost below the caves in which the 
great queen Kaahumanu spent the earliest days of her childhood.

This stone is said to be the kua or tapa board on which Hina pounded the 
bark for her cloth. Other legends of that same island locate Hina's home on 
the northeast coast near Pohakuloa.

The Hilo legends, however, do not deem it necessary that Hina and Maui 
should have their home across the wide channel which divides the Island 
Hawaii from the Island Maui in order to wage war successfully with the 
inconsiderate sun. Hina remained in her home by the Wailuku river, sometimes 
resting in her cave under Rainbow Falls, and sometimes working on the river 
bank, trusting her powerful son Maui to make the swiftly-passing lord of day 
go more slowly.

Maui possessed many supernatural powers. He could assume the form of birds 
or insects. He could call on the winds to do his will, or he could, if he 
wished, traverse miles with a single stride. It is interesting to note that 
the Hilo legends differ as to the way in which Ma-ui the man passed over to 
Mau-i the island. One legend says that he crossed the channel, miles wide, 
with a single step. Another says that he launched his canoe and with a 
breath the god of the winds placed him on the opposite coast, while another 
story says that Maui assumed the form of a white chicken, which flew over 
the waters to Haleakala. Here he took ropes made from the fibre of trees and 
vines and lassoed the sun while it climbed the side of the mountain and 
entered the great crater which hollows out the summit. The sun came through 
a large gap in the eastern side of the crater, rushing along as rapidly as 
possible. Then Maui threw his lassoes one after the other over the sun's 
legs (the rays of light), holding him fast and breaking off some of them. 
With a magic club Maui struck the face of the sun again and again. At last, 
wounded andweary, and also limping on its broken legs, the sun promised Maui 
to go slowly forevermore.

"La" among the Polynesians, like the word "Ra" among the Egyptians, means 
"sun" or "day" or "sungod"-and the mountain where the son of Hina won his 
victory over the monster of the heavens has long borne the name Hale-a-ka-
la, or House of the Sun.

Hina of Hilo soon realized the wonderful cleed which Maui had done. She 
spread out her fine tapas with songs of joy and cheerily performed the task 
which filled the hours of the day. The comfort of sunshine and cooling winds 
came with great power into Hina's life, bringing to her renewed joy and 
beauty.

XIII.
HINA AND THE WAILUKU RIVER.
HERE are two rivers of rushing, tumbling rapids and waterfalls in the 
Hawaiian Islands, both bearing the name of Wailuku. One is on the Island of 
Maui, flowing out of a deep gorge in the side of the extinct volcano Iao. 
Yosemite-like precipices surround this majestically-walled crater. The name 
lao means "asking for clouds." The head of the crater-valley is almost 
always covered with great masses of heavy rain clouds. Out of the crater the 
massed waters rush in a swift-flowing stream, of only four or five miles, 
emptying into Kahului harbor. The other Wailuku river is on the Island of 
Hawaii. The snows melt on the summits of the two great mountains, Mauna Kea 
and Mauna Loa. The water seeps through the porous lava from the eastern 
slope of Mauna Loa and the southern slope of Mauna Kea, meeting where the 
lava flows of centuries from each mountain have piled up against each other. 
Through the fragments of these volcanic battles the waters creep down the 
mountain side toward the sea.

At one place, a number of miles above the city of Hilo, the waters were 
heard gurgling and splashing far below the surface. Water was needed for the 
sugar plantations, which modern energy has established all along the eastern 
coast of the large island. A tunnel was cut into the lava, the underground 
stream was tapped-and an abundant supply of water secured and sluiced down 
to the large plantations below. The head waters of the Wailuku river 
gathered frorn the melting snow of the mountains found these channels, which 
centered at last in the bed of a very ancient and very interesting lava 
flow. Sometimes breaking forth in a large, turbulent flood, the stream 
forces its way over and around the huge blocks of lava which mark the course 
of the eruption of long ago. Sometimes it courses in a tunnel left by the 
flowing lava and comes up from below in a series of boiling pools. Then 
again it falls in majestic sheets over high walls of worn precipices. 
Several large falls and some very picturesque smaller cascades interspersed 
with rapids and natural bridges give to, this river a beauty peculiarly its 
own. The most weird of all the rough places through which the Walluku river 
flows is that known as the basin of Rainbow Falls near Hilo. Here Hina, the 
moon goddess of the Polynesians, lived in a great open cave, over which the 
falls hung their misty, rainbow-tinted veil. Her son Maui, the mighty demi-
god of Polynesia, supposed by some writers to be the sun-god of the 
Polynesians, had extensive lands along the northern bank of the river. Here 
among his cultivated fields he had his home, from which he went forth to 
accomplish the wonders attributed to him in the legends of the Hawaiians.

Below the cave in which Hina dwelt the river fought its way through a narrow 
gorge and then, in a series of many sinall falls, descended to the little 
bay, where its waters mingled with the surf of the salt sea. Far above the 
cave, in the bed of the river, dwelt Kuna. The district through which that 
portion of the river runs bears to this day the name "Wai-kuna" or "Kuna's 
river." When the writer was talking with the natives concerning this part of 
the old legend, they said "Kuna is not a Hawaiian word. It means something 
like a snake or a dragon, something we do not have in these islands." This, 
they thought, made the connection with the Hina legend valueless until they 
were shown that Tuna (or kuna) was the New Zealand name of a reptile which 
attacked Hina and struck her with his tail like a crocodile, for which Maui 
killed him. When this was understood, the Hawaiians were greatly interested 
to give the remainder of this legend and compare it with the New Zealand 
story. In New Zealand there are several statements concerning Tuna's 
dwelling place. He is sometimes represented as coming from a pool to attack 
Hina and sometimes from a distant stream, and sometimes from the river by 
which Hina dwelt. The Hawaiians told of the annoyances which Hina endured 
from Kuna while he lived above her home in the Wailuku. He would stop,up the 
river and fill it with dirt as when the freshets brought down the debris of 
the storms from the mountain sides. He would throw logs and rolling stones 
into the stream that they might be carried over the falls and drive Hina 
from her cave. He had sought Hina in many ways and had been repulsed again 
and again until at last hatred took the place of all more kindly feelings 
and he determined to destroy the divine chiefess.

Hina was frequently left with but little protection, and yet from her home 
in the cave feared nothing that Kuna could do. Precipices guarded the cave 
on either side, and any approach of an enemy through the falling water could 
be easily thwarted. So her chants rang out through the river valley even 
while floods swirled around her, and Kuna's missiles were falling over the 
rocky bed of the stream toward her. Kuna became very angry and, tittering 
great curses and calling upon all his magic forces to aid him, caught a 
great stone and at night hurled it into the gorge of the river below Hina's 
home, filling the river bed from bank to bank. "Ah, Hina! Now is the danger, 
for the river rises. The water cannot flow away. Awake! Awake!"

Hina is not aware of this evil which is so near. The water rises and rises, 
higher and higher. "Auwe! Auwe! Alas, alas, Hina must perish!" The water 
entered the opening of the cave and began to creep along the floor. Hina 
cannot fly, except into the very arms of her great enemy, who is waiting to 
destroy her. Then Hina called for Maui. Again and again her voice went out 
from the cave. It pierced through the storms and the clouds which attended 
Kuna's attack upon her. It swept along the side of the great mountain. It 
crossed the channel between the islands of Hawaii and Maui. Its anguish 
smote the side of the great mountain Haleakala, where Maui had been throwing 
his lassoes around the sun and compelling him, to go more slowly. When Maui 
heard Hina's cry for help echoing from cliff to cliff and through the 
ravines, he leaped at once to rush to her assistance.

Some say that Hina, the goddess, had a cloud servant, the "ao-opua," the 
"warning cloud," which rose swiftly above the falls when Hina cried for aid 
and then, assuming a peculiar shape, stood high above the hills that Maui 
might see it. Down the mountain he leaped to his magic canoe. Pushing it 
into the sea with two mighty strokes of his paddle lie crossed the sea to 
the mouth of the Wailuku river. Here even to the present day lies a long 
double rock, surrounded by the waters of the bay, which the natives call Ka 
waa o Maui, "The canoe of Maui." It represents to Hawaiian thought the magic 
canoe with which Maui always sailed over the ocean more swiftly than any 
winds could carry him. Leaving his canoe, Maui seized the magic club with 
which he had conquered the sun after lassoing him, and rushed along the dry 
bed of the river to the place of danger. Swinging the club swiftly around 
his head, lie struck the dam holding back the water of the rapidly-rising 
river.

"Ah! Nothing can withstand the magic club. The bank around one end of the 
dam gives way. The imprisoned waters leap into the new channel. Safe is Hina 
the goddess."

Kuna heard the crash of the club against the stones of the river bank and 
fled up the river to his home in the hidden caves by the pools in the river 
bed. Maui rushed up the river to punish Kuna-mo-o for the trouble he had 
caused Hina. When he came to the place where the dragon was hidden under 
deep waters, he took his magic spear and thrust it through the dirt and lava 
rocks along one side of the river, makin- a long hole, through which the 
waters rushed, revealing Kuna-mo-o's hiding place. This place of the spear 
thrust is known among the Hawaiians as Ka puka a Maui, "the door made by 
Maui." It is also known as "The natural bridge of the Wailuku river."

Kuna-mo-o fled to his different hiding places, but Maui broke up the river 
bed and drove the dragon out from every one, following him from place to 
place as he fled down the river. Apparently this is a legendary account of 
earthquakes. At last Kuna-mo-o found what seemed to be a safe hiding place 
in a series of deep pools, but Maui poured a lava flow into the river. He 
threw red-hot burning stones into the water until the pools were boiling and 
the steam was rising in clouds. Kuna uttered incantation after incantation, 
but the water scalded and burned him. Dragon as he was, his hard, tough skin 
was of no avail. The pain was becoming unbearable. With cries to his gods he 
leaped from the pools and fled down the river. The waters of the pools are 
no longer scalding, but they have never lost the tumbling, tossing, foaming, 
boiling swirl which Maui gave to them when he threw into them the red-hot 
stones with which he hoped to destroy Kuna, and they are known today as "The 
Boiling Pots."

Some versions of the legend say that Maui poured boiling water in the river 
and sent it in swift pursuit of Kuna, driving him froin point to point and 
scalding his life out of him. Others say that Maui chased the dragon, 
striking him again and again with his consecrated weapons, following Kuna 
down from falls to falls until he came to the place where Hina dwelt. Then, 
feeling that there was little use in flight, Kuna battled with Maui. His 
struggles were of no avail. He was forced over the falls into the stream 
below. Hina and her women encouraged Maui by their chants and strengthened 
him by the most powerful incantations with which they were acquainted. Great 
was their joy when they beheld Kuna's ponderous body hurled over the falls. 
Eagerly they watched the dragon as the swift waters swept him against the 
dam with which he had hoped to destroy Hina; and when the whirling waves 
caught him and dashed him through the new channel made by Maui's magic club, 
they rejoiced and sang the praise of the mighty warrior who had saved them. 
Maui had rushed along the bank of the river with tremendous strides 
overtaking the dragon as he was rolled over and over among the small 
waterfalls near the mouth of the river. Here Matii again attacked Kuna, at 
last beating the life out of his body. "Moo-Kuna" was the name given by the 
Hawaiians to the dragon. "Moo" means anything in lizard shape, but Kuna was 
unlike any lizard known in the Hawaiian Islands. Moo Kuna is the name 
sometimes given to a long black stone lying like an island in the waters 
between the small falls of the river. As one who calls attention to this 
legendary black stone says: "As if he were not dead enough already, every 
big freshet in the stream beats him and pounds him and drowns him over and 
over as he would have drowned Hina." A New Zealand legend relates a conflict 
of incantations, somewhat like the filling in of the Wailuku river by Kuna, 
and the cleaving of a new channel by Maui with the different use of means. 
In New Zealand the river is closed by the use of powerful incantations and 
charms and reopened by the use of those more powerful.

In the Hervey Islands, Tuna, the god of eels, loved Ina (Hina) and finally 
died for her, giving his head to be buried. From, this head sprang two 
cocoanut trees, bearing fruit marked with Tuna's eyes and mouth.

In Samoa the battle was between an owl and a serpent. The owl conquered by 
calling in the aid of a friend.

This story of Hina apparently goes far back in the traditions of 
Polynesians, even to their ancient home in Hawaiki, from which it was taken 
by one branch of the family to New Zealand and by another to the Hawaiian 
Islands and other groups in the Pacific Ocean. The dragon may even be a 
remembrance of the days when the Polynesians were supposed to dwell by the 
banks of the River Ganges in India, when crocodiles were dangerous enemies 
and heroes saved families from their destructive depredations.

XIV.
GHOSTS OF THE HILO HILLS.
THE legends about Hina and her famous son Maui and her less widely known 
daughters are common property among the natives of the beautiful little city 
of Hilo. One of these legends of more than ordinary interest finds its 
location in the three small hills back of Hilo toward the mountains.

These hills are small craters connected with some ancient lava flow of 
unusual violence. The eruption must have started far up on the slopes of 
Mauna Loa. As it sped down toward the sea it met some obstruction which, 
although overwhelmed, checked the flow and caused a great mass of cinders 
and ashes to be thrown out until a large hill with a hollow crater was built 
up, covering many acres of ground.

Soon the lava found another vent and then another obstruction and a second 
and then a third hill were formed nearer the sea. These hills or extinct 
craters bear the names Halai, Opeapea and Puu Honu. They are not far from 
the Wailuku river, famous for its picturesque waterfalls and also for the 
legends which are told along its banks. Here Maui had his lands overlooking 
the steep bluffs. Here in a cave under the Rainbow Falls was the home of 
Hina, the mother of Maui, according to the Hawaiian stories. Other parts of 
the Pacific sometimes make Hina Maui's wife, and sometimes a goddess from 
whom he descended. In the South Sea legends Hina was thought to have married 
the moon. Her home was in the skies, where she wove beautiful tapa cloths 
(the clouds), which were bright and glistening, so that when she rolled them 
up flashes of light (cloud lightning) could be seen on the earth. She laid 
heavy stones on the corners of these tapas, but sometimes the stones rolled 
off and made the thunder. Hina of the Rainbow Falls was a famous tapa maker 
whose tapa was the cause of Maui's conflict with the sun.

Hina had several daughters, four of whose names are given: Hina Ke Ahi, Hina 
Ke Kai, Hina Mahuia, and Hina Kuluua. Each name marked the peculiar "mana" 
or divine gift which Hina, the mother, had bestowed upon her daughters.

Hina Ke Ahi meant the Hina who had control of fire. This name is sometimes 
given to Hina the mother. Hina Ke Kai was the daughter who had power over 
the sea. She was said to have been in a canoe with her brother Maui when he 
fished up Cocoanut Island, his line breaking before he could pull it up to 
the mainland and make it fast. Hina Kuluua was the mistress over the forces 
of rain. The winds and the storms were supposed to obey her will. Hina 
Mahuia is pectiliarly a name connected with the legends of the other island 
groups of the Pacific. Mahuia or Mafuie was a god or goddess of fire all 
through Polynesia.

The legend of the Hilo hills pertains especially to Hina Ke Ahi and Hina 
Kuluua. Hina the mother gave the hill Halai to Hina Ke Ahi and the hill Puu 
Honu to Hina Kuluua for their families and dependents.

The hills were of rich soil and there was much rain. Therefore, for a long 
time, the two daughters had plenty of food for themselves and their people, 
but at last the days were like fire and the sky had no rain in it. The taro 
planted on the hillsides died. The bananas and sugar cane and sweet potatoes 
withered and the fruit on the trees was blasted. The people were faint 
becauseof hunger, and the shadow of death was over the land. Hina Ke Ahi 
pitied her suffering friends and determined to provide food for them. Slowly 
her people labored at her command. Over they went to the banks of the river 
course, which was only the bed of an ancient lava stream, over which no 
water was flowing; the famished laborers toiled, gathering and carrying back 
whatever wood they could find, then up the mountain side to the great koa 
and ohia forests, gathering their burdens of fuel according to the wishes of 
their chiefess.

Their sorcerers planted charms along the way and uttered incantations to 
ward off the danger of failure. The priests offered sacrifices and prayers 
for the safe and successful return of the burden-bearers. After many days 
the great quantity of wood desired by the goddess was piled up by the side 
of the Halai Hill.

Then came the days of digging out the hill and making a great imu or cooking 
oven and preparing it with stones and wood. Large quantities of wood were 
thrown into the place. Stones best fitted for retaining heat were gathered 
and the fires kindled. When the stones were hot, Hina Ke Ahi directed the 
people to arrange the imu. in its proper order for cooking the materials for 
a great feast. A place was made for sweet potatoes, another for taro, 
another for pigs and another for dogs. All the form of preparing the food 
for cooking was passed through, but no real food was laid on the stones. 
Then Hina told them to make a place in the imu for a human sacrifice. 
Probably out of every imu of the long ago a small part of the food was 
offered to the gods, and there may have been a special place in the imu for 
that part of the food to be cooked. At any rate Hina had this oven so built 
that the people understood that a remarkable sacrifice would be offered in 
it to the gods, who for some reason had sent the famine upon the people.

Human sacrifices were frequently offered by the Hawaiians even after the 
days of the coming of Captain Cook. A dead body was supposed to be 
acceptable to the gods when a chief's house was built, when a chief's new 
canoe was to be made or when temple walls were to be erected or victories 
celebrated. The bodies of the people belonged to the will of the chief. 
Therefore it was in quiet despair that the workmen obeyed Hina Ke Ahi and 
prepared the place for sacrifice. It might mean their own holocaust as an 
offering to the gods. At last Hina Ke Ahi bade the laborers cease their work 
and stand by the side of the oven ready to cover it with the dirt which had 
been thrown out and piled up by the side. The people stood by, not knowing 
upon whom, the blow might fall.

But Hina Ke Ahi was "Hina the kind," and although she stood before them 
robed in royal majesty and power, still her face was full of pity and love. 
Her voice melted the hearts of her retainers as she bade them carefully 
follow her directions.

"O my people. Where are you? Will you obey and do as I command? This imu is 
my imu. I shall lie down on its bed of burning stones. I shall sleep under 
its cover. But deeply cover ine or I may perish. Quickly throw the dirt over 
in), body. Fear not the fire. Watch for three days. A woman will stand by 
the imu. Obey her will."

Hina Ke Ahi was very beautiful, and her eyes flashed light like fire as she 
stepped into the great pit and lay down on the burning stones. A great smoke 
arose and gathered over the imu. The men toiled rapidly, placing the imu 
mats over their chiefess and throwing the dirt back into the oven until it 
was all thoroughly covered and the smoke was quenched.

Then they waited for the strange, mysterious thing which must follow the 
sacrifice of this divine chiefess.

Halai hill trembled and earthquakes shook the land round about. The great 
heat of the fire in the imu withered the little life which was still left 
from the famine. Meanwhile Hina Ke Ahi was carrying out her plan for 
securing aid for her people. She could not be injured by the heat for she 
was a goddess of fire. The waves of heat raged around her as she sank down 
through the stones of the imu into the underground paths which belonged to 
the spirit world. The legend says that Hina made her appearance in the form 
of a gushing stream of water which would always supply the want of her 
adherents. The second day passed. Hina was still journeying underground, but 
this time she came to the surface as a pool named Moe Waa (canoe sleep) much 
nearer the sea. The third day came and Hina caused a great spring of sweet 
water to burst forth from the sea shore in the very path of the ocean surf. 
This received the name Auauwai. Here Hina washed away all traces of her 
journey through the depths. This was the last of the series of earthquakes 
and the appearance of new water springs. The people waited, feeling that 
some more wonderful event must follow the remarkable experiences of the 
three days. Soon a woman stood by the imu, who commanded the laborers to dig 
away the dirt and remove the mats. When this was done, the hungry people 
found a very great abundance of food, enough to supply their want until the 
food plants should have time to ripen and the days of the famine should be 
over.

The joy of the people was great when they knew that their chiefess had 
escaped death and would still dwell among them in comfort. Many were the 
songs sung and stories told about the great famine and the success of the 
goddess of fire.

The second sister, Hina Kuluua, the goddess of rain, was always very jealous 
of her beautiful sister Hina Ke Ahi, and many times sent rain to put out 
fires which her sister tried to kindle. Hina Ke Ahi could not stand the rain 
and so fled with her people to a home by the seaside.

Hina Kuluua (or Hina Kuliua as she was sometimes known among the Hawaiians) 
could control rain and storms, but for some reason failed to provide a food 
supply for her people, and the famine wrought havoc among them. She thought 
of the stories told and songs sung about her sister and wished for the same 
honor for herself. She commanded her people to make a great imu for her in 
the hill Pun Honu. She knew that a strange power belonged to her and yet, 
blinded by jealousy, forgot that rain and fire could not work together. She 
planned to furnish a great supply of food for her people in the same way in 
which her sister had worked.

The oven was dug. Stones and wood were collected and the same ghostly array 
of potatoes, taro, pig and dog prepared as had been done before by her 
sister.

The kahunas or priests knew'that Hina Kuluua was going out of her province 
in trying to do as her sister had done, but there was no use in attempting 
to change her plans. jealousy is self-willed and obstinate and no amount of 
reasoning from her dependents could have any influence over her.

The ordinary incantations were observed, and Hina Kulutia gave the same 
directions as those her sister had given. The imu was to be well heated. The 
make-believe food was to be put in and a place left for her body. It was the 
goddess of rain making ready to lie down on a bed prepared for the goddess 
of fire. When all was ready, she lay down on the heated stones and the oven 
mats were thrown over her and the ghostly provisions. Then the covering of 
dirt was thrown back upon the mats and heated stones, filling the pit which 
had been dug. The goddess of rain was left to prepare a feast for her people 
as the goddess of fire had done for herfollowers.

Some of the legends have introduced the demi-god Maui into this story. The 
natives say that Maui came to "burn" or "cook the rain" and that he made the 
oven very hot, but that the goddess of rain escaped and hung over the hill 
in the form of a cloud. At least this is what the people saw-not a cloud of 
smoke over the imu, but a rain cloud. They waited and watched for such 
evidences of underground labor as attended the passage of Hina Ke Ahi 
through the earth from the hill to the sea, but the only strange appearance 
was the dark rain cloud. They waited three days and looked for their 
chiefess to come in the form of a woman. They waited another day and still 
another and no signs or wonders were rnanifest. Meanwhile Maui, changing 
himself into a white bird, flew up into the sky to catch the ghost of the 
goddess of rain which had escaped from the burning oven. Having caught this 
spirit, he rolled it in some kapa cloth which lie kept for food to be placed 
in an oven and carried it to a place in the forest on the mountain side 
where again the attempt was made to "burn the rain," but a great drop 
escaped and sped upward into the sky. Again Maui can ht the ghost of the 
goddess and carried it to a pali or precipice below the great volcano 
Kilauea, where he again tried to destroy it in the heat of a great lava 
oven, but this time the spirit escaped and found a safe refuge among kukui 
trees on the mountain side, from which she sometimes rises in clouds which 
the natives say are the sure sign of rain.

Whether this Maui legend has any real connection with the two Hinas and the 
famine we do not surely know. The legend ordinarily told among the Hawaiians 
says that after five days had passed the retainers decided on their own 
responsibility to open the imu. No woman had appeared to give them 
directions. Nothing but a mysterious rain cloud over the hill. In doubt and 
fear, the dirt was thrown off and the mats removed. Nothing was found but 
the ashes of Hina Kuluua. There was no food for her followers and the 
goddess had lost all power of appearing as a chiefess. Her bitter and 
thoughtless jealousy brought destruction upon herself and her people. The 
ghosts of Hina Ke Ahi and Hina Kuluua sometimes draw near to the old hills 
in the form of the fire of flowing lava or clouds of rain while the old men 
and women tell the story of the Hinas, the sisters of Maui, who were laid 
upon the burning stones of the imus of a famine.

XV.
HINA, THE WOMAN IN THE MOON.
THE Wailuku river has by its banks far up the mountain side some of the most 
ancient of the various interesting picture rocks of the Hawaiian Islands. 
The origin of the Hawaiian picture writing is a problem still unsolved, but 
the picture rocks of the Wailuku river are called "na kii o Maui," "the Maui 
pictures." Their antiquity is beyond question.

The most prominent figure cut in these rocks is that of the crescent moon. 
The Hawaiian legends do not attempt any direct explanation of the meaning of 
this picture writing. The traditions of the Polynesians both concerning Hina 
and Matti look to Hina as the moon goddess of their ancestors, and in some 
measure the Hawaiian stories confirm the traditions of the other island 
groups of the Pacific.

Fornander, in his history of the Polynesian race, gives the Hawaiian story 
of Hina's ascent to the moon, but applies it to a Hina the wife of a chief 
called Aikanaka rather than to the Hina of Hilo, the wife of Akalana, the 
father of Maui. However, Fornander evidently found some difficulty in 
determining the status of the one to whom he refers the legend, for he calls 
her "the mysterious wife of Aikanaka." In some of the Hawaiian legends Hina, 
the mother of Maui, lived on the southeast coast of the Island Maui at the 
foot of a hill famous in Hawaiian story as Kauiki. Fornander says that this 
"mysterious wife" of Aikanaka bore her children Puna and Huna, the latter a 
noted sea-rover among the Polynesians, at the foot of this hill Kauiki. It 
can very easily be supposed that a legend of the Ilina connected with the 
demi-god Maui might be given during the course of centuries to the other 
Hina, the mother of Huna. The application of the legend would make no 
difference to anyone were it not for the fact that the story of Hina and her 
ascent to the moon has been handed down in different forms among the 
traditions of Samoa, New Zealand, Tonga, Hervey Islands, Fate Islands, Nauru 
and other Pacific island groups. The Polynesian name of the moon, Mahina or 
Masina, is derived from Hina, the goddess mother of Matii. It is even 
possible to trace the name back to "Sin," the moon god of the Assyrians.

The moon goddess of Ponape was Ina-inaram. (Hawaiian Hina-malamalama), "Hina 
giving light."

In the Paumotan Islands an eclipse of the sun is called Higa-higa-hana 
(Hina-hiua-hana), "The act (hana) of Hina-the moon."

In New Zealand moonless nights were called "Dark Hina."

In Tahiti it is said there was war among the gods. They cursed the stars. 
Hina saved them, although they lost a little light. Then they cursed the 
sea, but Hina preserved the tides. They cursed the rivers, but Hina saved 
the springs-the moving waters inland, like the tides in the ocean.

The Hawaiians say that Hina and her maidens pounded out the softest, finest 
kapa cloth on the long, thick kapa board at the foot of Kauiki. Incessantly 
the restless sea dashed its spray over the picturesque groups of splintered 
lava rocks which form the Kauiki headland. Here above the reach of the surf 
still lies the long, black stone into which the legends say Hina's kapa 
board was changed. Here Hina took the leaves of the hala tree and, after the 
manner of the Hawaiian women of the ages past, braided in,ats for the 
household to sleep upon, and from the nuts of the kukui trees fashioned the 
torches which were burned around the homes of those of high chief rank.

At last she became weary of her work among mortals. Her family had become 
more and more troublesome. It was said that her sons were unruly and her 
husband lazy and shiftless. She looked into the heavens and determined to 
flee up the pathway of her rainbow through the clouds.

The Sun was very bright and Hina said, "I will go to the Sun." So she left 
her home very early in the morning and climbed up, higher, higher, until the 
heat of the rays of the sun beat strongly upon her and weakened her so that 
she could scarcely crawl along her beautiful path. Up a little higher and 
the clouds no longer gave her even the least shadow. The heat from the sun 
was so great that she began to feel the fire shriveling and torturing her. 
Quickly she slipped down into the storms around her rainbow and then back to 
earth. As the day passed her strength came back, and when the full moon rose 
through the shadows of the night she said, "I will climb to the moon and 
there find rest."

But when Hina began to go upward her husband saw her and called to her: "Do 
not go into the heavens." She answered him: `My mind is fixed; I will go to 
my new husband, the moon." And she climbed up higher and higher. Her husband 
ran toward her. She was almost out of reach, but he leaped and caught her 
foot. This did not deter Hina from her purpose. She shook off her husband, 
but as he fell he broke her leg so that the lower part came off in his 
hands. Hina went up through the stars, crying out the strongest incantations 
she could use. The powers of the night aided her. The mysterious hands of 
darkness lifted her, until she stood at the door of the moon. She had packed 
her calabash with her most priceless possessions and had carried it with her 
even when injured by her cruel husband. With her calabash she limped into 
the moon and found her abiding home. When the moon is full, the Hawaiians of 
the long ago, aye and even today, look into the quiet, silvery light and see 
the goddess in her celestial home, her calabash by her side.

The natives call her now Lono-moku, "the crippled Lono." From this watch 
tower in the heavens she pointed out to Kahai, one of her descendents, the 
way to rise up into the skies. The ancient chant thus describes his ascent:

"The rainbow is the path of Kahai.
Kahai rose. Kahai bestirred himself.
Kahai passed on the floating cloud of Kane.
Perplexed were the eyes of Alihi.
Kahai passed on on the glancing light.
The glancing light on men and canoes.
Above was Hanaiakamalama." (Hina).

Thus under the care of his ancestress Hina, Kahai, the great sea-rover, made 
his ascent in quest of adventures among the immortals.

In the Tongan Islands the legends say that Hina remains in the moon watching 
over the "fire-walkers" as their great protecting goddess.

The Hervey Island traditions say that the Moon (Marama) had often seen Hina 
and admired her, and at last had come down and caught her up to live with 
himself. The moonlight in its glory is called Inamotea, "the brightness of 
Ina."

The story as told on Atiu Island (one of the Society group) is that Hina 
took her human husband with her to the moon, where they dwelt happily for a 
time, but as he grew old she prepared a rainbow, down which he descended to 
the earth to die, leaving Hina forevermore as "the woman in the moon." The 
Savage Islanders worshiped the spirits of their ancestors, saying that many 
of them went up to the land of Sina, the always bright land in the skies. To 
the natives of Niue Island, Hina has been the goddess ruling over all tapa 
making. They say that her home is "Motu a Hina," "the island of Hina," the 
home of the dead in the skies.

The Samoans said that the Moon received Hina and a child, and also her tapa 
board and mallet and material for the manufacture of tapa cloth. Therefore, 
when the moon is shining in full splendor, they shade their eyes and look 
for the goddess and the tools with which she fashions the tapa clouds in the 
heavens.

The New Zealand legend says that the woman went after water in the night. As 
she passed down the path to the spring the bright light of the full moon 
made the way easy for her quick footsteps, but when she had filled her 
calabash and started homeward, suddenly the bright light was hidden by a 
passing cloud and she stumbled against a stone in the path and fell to the 
ground, spilling the water she was carrying. Then she became very angry and 
cursed the moon heartily. Then the moon became angry and swiftly swept down 
upon her from the skies, grasping her and lifting her up. In her terrible 
fight she caught a small tree with one hand and her calabash with the other. 
But oh! the strong moon pulled her up with the tree and the calabash and 
there in the full m,oon they can all be traced when the nights are clear.

Pleasant or Nauru Island, in which a missionary from Central Union Church, 
Honolulu, is laboring, tells the story of Gigu, a beautiful young woman, who 
has many of the experiences of Hina. She opened the eyes of the Mother of 
the Moon as Hina, in some of the Polynesian legends, is represented to have 
opened the eyes of one of the great goddesses, and in reward is married to 
Maraman, the Moon, with whom she lives ever after, and in whose embrace she 
can always be seen when the moon is full. Gigu is Hina under another and 
more guttural form of speech. Maraman is the same as Malama, one of the 
Polynesian names for the moon.
