NEW LANDS 

BY 

CHARLES FORT 





Introduction by 

BOOTH TARKINGTON 




PART ONE

INTRODUCTION 

"Personally" (as we are more wont to say in our youth than in any other 
ages) I find that a book with an Introduction always worries me a little. I 
want to read the book itself, not the Introduction, but for some reason I 
have a feeling that it is my unpleasant duty to read the Introduction. 
Usually I decide to read the book firs and the Introduction afterward; but 
then my reading is tainted throughout by my sense of guilt; for I have 
learned by experience that I never do read the Introduction afterward. So, 
in time, I have reached the conclusion that an Introduction ought to inform 
the reader's mere first glance that he needn't feel guilty if he doesn't 
read it afterward. Adopting this view, the author of the present 
Introduction finds himself perfectly equipped for his task. Readers might be 
made much more uncomfortable if the Introduction of "New Lands" were what 
such a book might conventionally expect: a professionally scientific writer 
-- preferably an outraged practising astronomer. 

A few years ago I had one of those pleasant illnesses that permit the 
patient to read in bed for several days without self-reproach; and I sent 
down to a bookstore for whatever might be available upon criminals, crimes 
and criminology. Among the books brought me in response to this morbid 
yearning was one with the title, "The Book of the Damned." 

I opened it, not at the first page, looking for Cartouche Jonathan Wild, 
Pranzini, Lacenaire, and read the following passage: 



"The fittest survive. 

What is meant by the fittest? 

Not the strongest; not the cleverest-- 

Weakness and stupidity everywhere survive. 

There is no way of determining fitness except in that a thing does survive. 

`Fitness' then, is only another name for `survival.'" 



[1/2] 



Finding no Guiteau or Troppmann here, I let the pages slide under my fingers 
and stopped at this: 



"My own pseudo-conclusion: 

That we've been damned by giants sound asleep, or by great scientific 
principles and abstractions that cannot realize themselves: that little 
harlots have visited their caprices upon us; that clowns, with buckets of 
water from which they pretend to cast thousands of good-sized fishes have 
anathemized us for laughing disrespectfully, because, as with all clowns, 
underlying buffoonery is the desire to be taken seriously; that pale 
ignorances, presiding over microscopes by which they cannot distinguish 
flesh from nostoc or fishes' spawn, have visited upon us their wan 
solemnities. We've been damned by corpses and skeletons and mummies, which 
twitch and totter with pseudo-life derived from conveniences." 



With some astonishment, I continued to dip into the book, sounding it here 
and there, but did not bring up even so well-damned a sample of the bottom 
as Benedict Arnold. Instead I got these: 



"An object from which nets were suspended-- 

Deflated balloon with its network hanging from it-- 

A super-dragnet? 

That something was trawling overhead? 

The birds of Baton Rouge. 

I think that we're fished for. It may be we're highly esteemed by super-
epicures somewhere." 



..."Melanicus." 

That upon the wings of a super-bat, he broods over this earth and over other 
worlds, perhaps deriving something from them: hovers on wings or wing-like 
appendages, or planes that are hundreds of miles from tip to tip -- a super-
evil thing that is exploiting us. By Evil I mean that which makes us 
useful." 



..."British India Company's steamer Patna, while on a [2/3] voyage up the 
Persian Gulf. In May, 1880, on a dark night about 11:30 P.M. there suddenly 
appeared on each side of the ship an enormous luminous wheel, whirling 
about, the spokes of which seemed to brush the ship along...and although the 
wheels must have been some 500 or 600 yards in diameter, the spokes could be 
distinctly see all the way round." 



..."I shall have to accept that, floating in the sky of this earth, there 
are often fields of ice as extensive as those on the Arctic Ocean -- volumes 
of water in which there are many fishes and frogs -- tracts of land covered 
with caterpillars --" 



..."Black rains -- red rains -- the fall of a thousand tons of butter. 

Jet black snow -- pink snow -- blue hailstones -- hailstones flavored like 
oranges. 

Punk and silk and charcoal." 



..."A race of tiny beings 

They crucified cockroaches. 

Exquisite beings --" 



But here I turned back to the beginning and read this vigorous and 
astounding book straight through, and then re-read it for the pleasure it 
gave me in the way of its writing and in the substance of what it told. Doré 
should have illustrated it, I thought, or Blake. Here indeed was a "brush 
dipped in earthquake and eclipse"; though the wildest mundane earthquakes 
are but earthquakes in teapots compared to what goes on in the visions 
conjured up before us by Mr. Charles Fort. For he deals in nightmare, not on 
the planetary, but on the constellational scale, and the imagination of one 
who staggers along after him is frequently left gasping and flaccid. 

Now he has followed "The Book of the Damned" with "New Lands" pointing 
incidentally to Mars as "the San Salvador of the Sky," and renewing his 
passion for the dismayingly significant "damned --" tokens and strange hints 
excluded by the historically mercurial acceptances of "Dogmatic Science." Of 
his attack on [3/4] the astronomers it can at least be said that the 
literature of indignation is enriched by it. 

To the "university-trained mind" here is wildness almost as wild as Roger 
Bacon's once appeared to be; though of course even the layest of lay 
brothers must not assume that all wild science will in time become accepted 
law, as some of Roger's did. Retort to Mr. Fort must be left to the outraged 
astronomer. If indeed any astronomer could feel himself so little outraged 
as to offer a retort. Lay brethren are outside the quarrel and must content 
themselves with gratitude to a man who writes two such books as "New Lands" 
and "The Book of the Damned"; gratitude for passages and pictures -- moving 
pictures -- of such cyclonic activity and dimensions that a whole new area 
of a reader's imagination stirs in amazement and is brought to life.

CHAPTER ONE





LANDS in the sky -- 

That they are nearby -- 

That they do not move. 

I take for a principle that all being is the infinitely serial, and that 
whatever has been will, with differences of particulars, be again -- 

The last quarter of the fifteenth century -- land to the west! 

This first quarter of the twentieth century -- we shall have revelations. 

There will be data. There will be many. Behind this book, unpublished 
collectively, or held as constituting its reserve forces, there are other 
hundreds of data, but independently I take for a principle that all 
existence is a flux and a re-flux, by which periods of expansion follow 
periods of contraction; that few men can even think widely when times are 
narrow times, but that human constrictions cannot repress extensions of 
thoughts and lives and enterprise and dominion when times are wider times -- 
so then that the pageantry of foreign coasts that was revealed behind blank 
horizons after the year 1492, can not be, in the course of development, the 
only astounding denial of seeming vacancy -- that the spirit, or the 
animation, and the stimulations and the needs of the fifteenth century are 
all appearing again, and that requital may appear again -- 

Aftermath of war, as in the year 1492: demands for readjustments; crowded 
and restless populations, revolts against limitations, intolerable 
restrictions against emigrations. The young man is no longer urged, or is no 
longer much inclined, to go westward. He will, or must, go somewhere. If 
directions alone no longer invite him, he may hear invitation in dimensions. 
There are [7/8] many persons, who have not investigated for themselves, who 
think that both poles of this earth have been discovered. There are too many 
women traveling luxuriously in "Darkest Africa."(1) Eskimos of Disco, 
Greenland, are publishing a newspaper. There must be outlet, or there will 
be explosion -- 

Outlet and invitation and opportunity -- 

San Salvadors of the Sky -- a Plymouth Rock that hangs in the heavens of 
Servia -- a foreign coast from which storms have brought materials to the 
city of Birmingham, England. 

Or the mentally freezing, or dying, will tighten their prohibitions, and the 
chill of their censorships will contract, to extinction, our lives, which, 
without sin, represent matter deprived of motion. Their ideal is Death, or 
approximate death, warmed over occasionally only enough to fringe with 
uniform, decorous icicles -- from which there will be no escape, if, for the 
living and sinful and adventurous there be not San Salvadors somewhere else, 
a Plymouth Rock of reversed significance, coasts of sky-continents. 

But every consciousness that we have of needs, and all hosts, departments, 
and sub-divisions of data that indicate the possible requital of needs are 
opposed -- not by the orthodoxy of the common Puritans, but by the Puritans 
of Science, and their austere, disheartening, dried or frozen orthodoxy. 

Islands of space -- see Sci. Amer., vol. this and p. that -- accounts from 
the Repts. of the Brit. Assoc. for the Ad. of Sci. -- Nature, etc. -- except 
for an occasional lapse, our sources of data will not be sneered at. As to 
our interpretations, I consider them, myself, more as suggestions and 
gropings and stimuli. Islands of space and the rivers and oceans of an 
extra-geography -- 

Stay and let salvation damn you -- or straddle an auroral beam and paddle it 
from Rigel to Betelgeuse. If there be no accepting that there are such 
rivers and oceans beyond this earth, stay and travel upon steamships with 
schedules that can be depended upon, food so well cooked and well served, 
comfort looked after so carefully -- or some day board the thing that was 
seen over the city of Marseilles, Aug. 19, 1887, and ride on that, bearing 
down upon the moon, giving up for lost, escaping collision by the swirl of a 
current that was never heard of before.(2) 

There are, or there are not, nearby cities of foreign existences. [8/9] They 
have, or they have not, been seen, by reflection, in the skies of Sweden and 
Alaska. As one will. Whether acceptable, or too preposterous to be thought 
of, our data are of rabbles of living things that have been seen in the sky; 
also of processions of military beings -- monsters that live in the sky and 
die in the sky, and spatter this earth with their red life-fluids -- ships 
from other worlds that have been seen by millions of inhabitants of this 
earth, exploring, night after night, in the sky of France, England, New 
England, and Canada -- signals from the moon, which, according to notable 
indications, may not be so far from this earth as New York is from London -- 
definitely reported and, in some instances, multitudinously witnessed, 
events that have been disregarded by our opposition -- 

A scientific priestcraft -- 

"Thou shalt not!" is crystallized in its frozen textbooks. 

I have data upon data upon data of new lands that are not far away. I hold 
out expectations and the materials of new hopes and new despairs and new 
triumphs and new tragedies. I hold out my hands and point to the sky -- 
there is a hierarchy that utters me manacles, I think -- there is a dominant 
force that pronounces prisons that have dogmas for walls for such thoughts. 
It binds its formulas around all attempting extensions. 

But sounds have ben heard in the sky. They have been heard, and it is not 
possible to destroy the records of them. They have been heard. In their 
repetitions and regularities of series and intervals, we shall recognize 
perhaps interpretable language. Columns of clouds, different-colored by 
sunset, have vibrated to the artillery of other worlds like the strings of a 
cosmic harp, and I conceive of no buzzing of insects that can forever divert 
attention from such dramatic reverberations. Language has shone upon the 
dark parts of the moon: luminous exclamations that have fluttered in the 
lunar crater Copernicus; the eloquence of the starlike light in Aristarchus; 
hymns that have been chanted in lights and shades upon Linné; the wilder, 
luminous music in Plato -- 

But not a sound that has been heard in the sky, not a thing that has fallen 
from the sky, not a thing that "should not be," but that has nevertheless 
been seen in the sky can we, with [9/10] any sense of freedom, investigate, 
until first we find out about the incubus that in the past has suffocated 
even speculation. I shall find out for myself: anybody who cares to may find 
out with me. A ship from a foreign world does, or does not, sail in the sky 
of this earth. It is in accordance with observations by hundreds of 
thousands of witnesses that this event has taken place, and, if the time be 
when aeronautics upon this earth is of small development, that is an 
important circumstance to consider -- but there is suffocation upon the 
whole occurrence and every one of its circumstances. Nobody can give good 
attention to the data, if diverting his mind is consciousness, altogether 
respectful, of the scientists who say that there are no other physical 
worlds except planets, millions of miles away, distances that conceivable 
vessels could not traverse. I should like to let loose, in an opening 
bombardment, the data of the little black stones of Birmingham, which, time 
to time, in a period of eleven years, fell obviously from a fixed point in 
the sky, but such a release now, would be wasted. It will have to be 
prepared for. Now each one would say to himself that there are no such fixed 
points in the sky. Why not? Because astronomers say that there are not. 

But there is something else that is implied. Implied is the general 
supposition that the science of astronomy represents all that is most 
accurate, most exacting, painstaking, semi-religious in human thought, and 
is therefore authoritative. 

Anybody who has not been through what I've been through, in investigating 
this subject, would ask what are the bases and what is the consistency of 
the science of astronomy. The miserable, though at times amusing, confusions 
of thought that I find in this field of supposed research word my inquiry 
differently -- what of dignity, or even of decency, is in it? 

Phantom dogmas, with their tails clutching at vacancies, are coiled around 
our data. 

Serpents of pseudo-thought are stifling history. 

They are squeezing "Thou shalt not!" upon Development. 

New Lands -- and the horrors and lights, explosions and music of them; 
rabbles of hellhounds and the march of military angels. But they are 
Promised Lands, and first must we traverse a des- [10/11] ert. There is 
ahead of us a waste of parallaxes and spectrograms and triangulations. It 
may be weary going through a waste of astronomic determinations, but that 
depends -- 

If out of a dreary, academic zenith shower betrayals of frailty, folly, and 
falsification, they will be manna to our malices -- 

Or sterile demonstrations be warmed by our cheerful cynicisms into delicious 
little lies--blossoms and fruits of unexpected oases -- 

Rocks to strike with our suspicions -- and the gush of exposures foaming 
with new implications. 

Tyrants, dragons, giants -- and, if all be dispatched with the skill and the 
might and the triumph over awful odds of the hero who himself tells his 
story -- 

I hear three yells from some hitherto undiscovered, grotesque critter at the 
very entrance of the desert. [11]

CHAPTER TWO





"PREDICTION Confirmed!"(1) 

"Another Verification!"(2) 

"A Third Verification of Prediction!"(3) 

Three times, in spite of its long-established sobriety, the Journal of the 
Franklin Institute, vols. 106 and 107, reels with an astronomer's 
exhilarations. He might exult and indulge himself, and that would be no 
affair of ours, and, in fact, we'd like to see everybody happy, perhaps, but 
it is out of these three chanticleerities by Prof. Pliny Chase that we 
materialize our opinion that, so far as methods and strategies are 
concerned, no particular differences can be noted between astrologers and 
astronomers, and that both represent engulfment in Dark Ages. Lord Bacon 
pointed out that astrologers had squirmed into prestige and emolument by 
shooting at marks, disregarding their misses, and recording their hits with 
unseemly advertisement.(4) When, in August 1878, Prof. Swift and Prof. 
Watson said that, during an eclipse of the sun, they had seen two luminous 
bodies that might be planets between Mercury and the Sun, Prof. Chase 
announced that, five years before, he had made a prediction, and that it had 
been confirmed by the positions of these bodies. Three times, in capital 
letters, he screamed, or announced, according to one's sensitiveness, or 
prejudices, that the "new planets" were in the exact positions of his 
calculations. Prof. Chase wrote that, before his time, there had been two 
great instances of astronomic calculation confirmed: the discovery of 
Neptune and the discovery of "the asteroidal belt," a claim that is 
disingenuously worded. If by mathematical principles, or by any other 
definite principles, there has ever been one great, or little, instance of 
astronomic discovery by means of calculations, confusion must destroy us, in 
the introductory position that we take, [12/13] or expose our 
irresponsibility, and vitiate all that follows: that our data are oppressed 
by a tyranny of false announcements; that there never has been an astronomic 
discovery other than the observational or the accidental.(5) 

In The Story of the Heavens, Sir Robert Ball's opinion of the discovery of 
Neptune is that it is a triumph unparalled in the annals of science.(6) He 
lavishes -- the great astronomer Leverrier, buried for months in profound 
meditations -- the dramatic moment -- Leverrier rises from his calculations 
and points to the sky -- "Lo!" there a new planet is found.(7) 

My desire is not so much to agonize over the single fraudulencies or 
delusions, as to typify the means by which the science of Astronomy has 
established and maintained itself: 

According to Leverrier, there was a planet external to Uranus; according to 
Hansen, there were two; according to Airy, "doubtful if there were one." 

One planet was found -- so calculated Leverrier, in his profound 
meditations. Suppose two had been found -- confirmation of the brilliant 
computations by Hansen. None -- the opinion of the great astronomer, Sir 
George Airy. 

Leverrier calculated that the hypothetical planet was at a distance from the 
sun, within the limits of 35 and 37.9 times this earth's distance from the 
sun. The new planet was found in a position said to be 30 times this earth's 
distance from the sun. The discrepancy was so great that, in the United 
States, astronomers refused to accept that Neptune had been discovered by 
means of calculation: see such publications as the American Journal of 
Science, of the period.(8) Upon August 29, 1849, Dr. Babinet read, to the 
French Academy a paper in which he showed that, by observations of three 
years, the revolution of Neptune would have to be placed at 165 years.(9) 
Between the limits of 207 and 233 years was the period that Leverrier had 
calculated. Simultaneously, in England, Adams had calculated. Upon Sept. 2, 
1846, after he had, for at least a month, been charting the stars in the 
region toward which Adams had pointed, Prof. Challis wrote to Sir George 
Airy that this work would occupy his time for three more months. This 
indicates the extent of the region toward which Adams had pointed. [13/14] 

The discovery of the asteroids, or in Prof. Chases's not very careful 
language, the discovery of the "asteroidal belt as deduced from Bode's Law": 

We learn that Baron Von Zach had formed a society of twenty-four astronomers 
to search, in accordance with Bode's Law, for "a planet" -- and not "a 
group," not "an asteroidal belt" -- between Jupiter and Mars. The 
astronomers had organized, dividing the zodiac into twenty-four zones, 
assigning each zone to an astronomer. They searched. They found not one 
asteroid. Seven or eight hundred are now known. 

Philosophical Magazine, 12-62:(10) 

That Piazzi, the discoverer of the first asteroid, had not been searching 
for a hypothetic body, as deduced from Bode's Law, but, upon an 
investigation of his own, had been charting stars in the constellation 
Taurus, night of Jan. 1, 1801. He noticed a light that he thought had moved, 
and, with his mind a blank, so far as asteroids and brilliant deductions 
were concerned, announced that he had discovered a comet. 

As an instance of the crafty way in which some astronomers now tell the 
story, see Sir Robert Ball's The Story of the Heavens, p. 230:(11) 

The organization of astronomers of Lilienthal, but never a hint that Piazzi 
was not one of them -- "the search for a small planet was soon rewarded by a 
success that has rendered the evening of the first day of the nineteenth 
century memorable in astronomy." Ball tells of Piazzi's charting of the 
stars, and makes it appear that Piazzi had charted stars as a means of 
finding asteroids deductively, rewarded soon by success, whereas Piazzi had 
never heard of such a search, and did not know an asteroid when he saw one. 
"This laborious and accomplished astronomer had organized an ingenious 
system of exploring the heavens, which was eminently calculated to 
discriminate a planet among the starry host...at length he was rewarded by a 
success which amply compensated him for all his toil." 

Prof. Chase -- these two great instances not of mere discovery, but of 
discovery by means of calculation according to him -- now the subject of his 
supposition that he, too, could calculate triumphantly -- the verification 
depended upon the accuracy of [14/15] Prof. Swift and Prof. Watson in 
recording the positions of the bodies that they had announced --(12) 

Sidereal Messenger, 6-84:(13) 

Prof. Colbert, Superintendent of the Dearborn Observatory, leader of the 
party of which Prof. Swift was a member, says that the observations by Swift 
and Watson agreed, because Swift had made his observations agree with 
Watson's. The accusation is not that Swift had falsely announced a discovery 
of two unknown bodies, but that his precise determining of positions had 
occurred after Watson's determinations had been published. The accusation is 
not that Swift had falsely announced a discovery of two unknown bodies, but 
that his precise determining of positions had occurred after Watson's 
determinations had been published. 

Popular Astronomy, 7-13:(14) 

Prof. Asaph Hall writes that, several days after the eclipse, Prof. Watson 
told him that he had seen "a" luminous body near the sun and that his 
declaration that he had seen two unknown bodies was not made until after 
Swift had been heard from. 

Perched upon two delusions, Prof. Chase crowed his false raptures. The 
unknown bodies, whether they had ever been in the orbit of his calculations 
or not, were never seen again. 

So it is our expression that hosts of astronomers calculate, and 
calculation-mad, calculate and calculate and calculate, and that when one of 
them does point within 600,000,000 miles (by conventional measurements) of 
something that is found, he is the Leverrier of the text books; that the 
others are the Prof. Chases not of the text books. 

As to most of us, the symbols of the infinitesimal calculus humble 
independent thinking into the conviction that used to be enforced by drops 
of blood from a statue. In the farrago and conflicts of daily lives, it is 
relief to feel such a rapport with finality, in a religious sense, or in a 
mathematical sense. So then, if the seeming of exactness in Astronomy be 
either infamously, or carelessly and laughingly, brought about by the 
connivances of which Swift and Watson were accused, and if the prestige of 
Astronomy be founded upon nothing but huge capital letters and exclamation 
points, or upon the disproportionality of balancing one Leverrier against 
hundreds of Chases, it may not be better that we should know this, if then 
to those of us who, in the religious sense, have nothing to depend upon, 
comes deprivation of even this last, lingering seeming of foundation, 
[15/16] or seeming existence of exactness and realness, somewhere -- 

Except -- that, if there be nearby lands in the sky and beings from foreign 
worlds that visit this earth, that is a great subject, and the trash that is 
clogging an epoch must be cleared away. 

We have had a little sermon upon the insecurity of human triumphs, and, 
having brought it to a climax, now seems to be the time to stop; but there 
is still an involved "triumph" and I'd not like to have inefficiency, as 
well as probably everything else, charged against us -- 

The Discovery of Uranus. 

We mention this stimulus to the text-book writers' ecstasies, because out of 
phenomena of the planet Uranus, the "Neptune-triumph" developed. For Richard 
Proctor's reasons for arguing that this discovery was not accidental, see 
Old and New Astronomy, p.646.(15) Philosophical Transactions, 71-492 -- a 
paper by Herschel -- an "account of a Comet discovered on March 13, 
1781."(16) A year went by, and not an astronomer in the world knew a planet 
when he saw one: then Lexell did find out that the supposed comet was a 
planet.(17) 

Statues from which used to drip the life-blood of a parasitic cult -- 

Structures of parabolas from which bleed equations -- 

As we go along we shall develop the acceptance that astronomers might as 
well try to squeeze blood from images as to try to seduce symbols into 
conclusions, because applicable mathematics has no more to do with planetary 
inter-actions than have statues of saints. If this denial of calculi have 
place in gravitational astronomy be accepted, the astronomers lose their 
supposed god; they become an unfocussed priesthood; the stamina of their 
arrogance wilts. We begin with the next to the simplest problem in celestial 
mechanics: that is the formulation of the inter-actions of the sun and the 
moon and this earth. In the highest mathematics, final, sacred mathematics, 
can this next to the simplest problem in so-called mathematical astronomy be 
solved? 

It cannot be solved. 

Every now and then, somebody announces that he has solved the Problem of the 
Three Bodies, but it is always an incomplete, [16/17] or impressionistic 
demonstration, compounded of abstractions, and ignoring the conditions of 
bodies in space. Over and over we shall find vacancy under supposed 
achievements; elaborate structures that are pretensions without foundation. 
Here we learn that astronomers can not formulate the inter-actions of three 
bodies in space, but calculate anyway, and publish what they call the 
formula of a planet that is inter-acting with a thousand other bodies. They 
explain. It will be one of our most lasting impressions of astronomers: they 
explain and explain and explain. The astronomers explain that, though in 
finer terms, the mutual effects of three planets can not be determined, so 
dominant is the power of the sun that all other effects are negligible. 

Before the discovery of Uranus, there was no way by which the miracles of 
the astro-magicians could be tested. They said that their formulas worked 
out, and external inquiry was panic-stricken at the mention of a formula. 
But Uranus was discovered, and the magicians were called upon to calculate 
his path. They did calculate, and, if Uranus had moved in a regular path, I 
do not mean to say that astronomers or college boys have no mathematics by 
which to determine anything so simple. 

They computed the orbit of Uranus. 

He went somewhere else. 

They explained. They computed some more. They went on explaining and 
computing, year in and year out, and the planet Uranus kept on going 
somewhere else. Then they conceived of a powerful perturbing force beyond 
Uranus -- so then that at the distance of Uranus the sun is not so dominant 
-- in which case the effects of Saturn upon Uranus and Uranus upon Saturn 
are not so negligible -- on through complexes of inter-actions that 
infinitely intensify by cumulativeness into a black outlook for the whole 
brilliant system. The palæo-astronomers calculated, and for more than fifty 
years pointed variously at the sky. Finally two of them, of course agreeing 
upon the general background of Uranus, pointed within distances that are 
conventionally supposed to have been about six hundred millions of miles of 
Neptune, and now it is religiously, if not insolently, said that the 
discovery of Neptune was not accidental -- [17/18] 

That the test of that which is not accidental is ability to do it again -- 

That it is within the power of anybody, who does not know a hyperbola from a 
cosine, to find out whether the astronomers are led by a cloud of rubbish by 
day and a pillar of bosh by night -- 

If, by the magic of his mathematics, any astronomer could have pointed to 
the position of Neptune, let him point to the planet past Neptune. According 
to the same reasoning by which a planet past Uranus was supposed to be, a 
Trans-Neptunian planet may be supposed to be. Neptune shows perturbations 
similar to those of Uranus. 

According to Prof. Todd there is such a planet, and it revolves around the 
sun once in 375 years.(18) There are two according to Prof. Forbes: one 
revolving once in 1,000 years, and the other once in 5,000 years. See 
Macpherson's A Century's Progress in Astronomy.(19) It exists according to 
Dr. Eric Doolittle, and revolves once in 283 years, (Sci. Amer., 122-
641).(20) According to Mr. Hind it revolves once in 1,600 years, (Smithson. 
Miscell. Cols., 20-20).(21) 

So then we have found out some things, and, relatively to the oppressions 
that we felt from our opposition, they are reassuring. But also they are 
depressing. Because, if, in this existence of ours, there is no prestige 
higher than that of astronomic science, and, if that seeming of substantial 
renown has been achieved by a composition of bubbles, what of anything like 
soundness must there be to all lesser reputes and achievements? 

Let three bodies inter-act. There is no calculus by which their inter-
actions can be formulated. But there are a thousand inter-acting bodies in 
this solar system -- or supposed solar system -- and we find that the higher 
prestige in our existence is built upon the tangled assertions that there 
are magicians who can compute in a thousand quantities, though they cannot 
compute in three. 

Then all other so-called human triumphs, or moderate successes, products of 
anybody's reasoning processes and labors -- and what are they, if higher 
than them all, more academic, austere, rigorous, exact are the methods and 
the processes of the astro- [18/19] nomers? What can be thought of our whole 
existence, its nature and its destiny? 

That our existence, a thing within one solar system, or supposed solar 
system, is a stricken thing that is mewling through space, shocking able-
minded, healthy systems with the sores on its sun, its ghastly moons, its 
civilizations that are all broken out with sciences; a celestial leper, 
holding out doddering expanses into which charitable systems drop golden 
comets? If it be the leprous thing that our findings seem to indicate, there 
is no encouragement for us to go on. We cannot discover: we can only betray 
new symptoms. If I be part of such a stricken thing, I know of nothing but 
sickness and sores and rags to reason with: my data will be pustules; my 
interpretations will be inflammations -- [19]

twice, for his first announcement failed to prompt the discovery of a trans-
Uranian planet. Lowell states: "Leverrier's first memoir on the subject was

of the disturbing planet on June 1, 1846. There is no evidence that the 
slightest search in consequence was made by anybody, with the possible

his third paper, giving an orbit, mass, and more precise place for the 
unknown. Still no search followed." And, it remained for Leverrier to write 
to Galle at Berlin and prompt him to look for the planet before it was 
discovered. Percival Lowell. The Evolution of Worlds. New York: Macmillan

CHAPTER THREE





SOUTHERN plantations and the woolly heads of negroes pounding the ground -- 
cries in northern regions and round white faces turned to the sky -- fiery 
globes in the sky -- a study in black, white, and golden formations in one 
general glow. Upon the night of November 13-14, 1833, occurred the most 
sensational celestial spectacle of the nineteenth century: for six hours 
fiery meteors gushed from the heavens, and were visible along the whole 
Atlantic coast of the United States. 

One supposes that astronomers do not pound the ground with their heads, and 
presumably they do not screech, but they have feelings just the same. They 
itched. Here was something to formulate. When he hears of something new and 
unquestionable in the sky, an astronomer is diseased with ill-suppressed 
equations. Symbols persecute him for expression. His is the frenzy of 
someone who would stop automobiles, railroad trains, bicycles, all things, 
to measure them; run, with a yardstick, after sparrows, flies, all persons 
passing his door. This is supposed to be scientific, but it can be 
monomaniac. Very likely the distress and the necessity of Prof. Olmstead 
were keenest. He was the first to formulate. He "demonstrated" that these 
meteors, known as the Leonids, revolved around the sun once in six 
months.(1) 

They didn't. 

Then Prof. Newton "demonstrated" that the "real" period was thirty-three and 
a quarter years.(2) But this was done empirically, and that is not divine, 
nor even aristocratic, and the thing would have to be done rationally, or 
mathematically, by someone, because, if there be not mathematical treatment, 
in gravitational terms, of such phenomena, astronomers are in reduced 
circumstances. It was Dr. Adams, who, emboldened with his experience in not 
having to point anywhere near Neptune, but nevertheless being acclaimed by 
all patriotic Englishmen as the real discoverer of Neptune, mathematically 
"confirmed" Prof. [20/21] Newton's "findings." Dr. Adams predicted that the 
Leonids would return in November, 1866, and in November, 1899, occupying 
several years, upon each occasion, in passing a point in this earth's orbit. 

There were meteors upon the night of Nov. 13-14, 1866. They were plentiful. 
They often are in the middle of November. They no more resembled the 
spectacle of 1833 than an ordinary shower resembles a cloudburst. But the 
"demonstration" required that there should be an equal display, or, 
according to some aspects, a greater display, upon the corresponding night 
of the next year. There was a display, the next year; but it was in the sky 
of the United States, and was not seen in England. Another occurrence 
nothing like that of 1833 was reported from the United States. 

By conventional theory, this earth was in a vast, wide stream of meteors, 
the earth revolving so as to expose successive parts to bombardment. So 
keenly did Richard Proctor visualize the earth so immersed and so bombarded, 
that, when nothing was seen in England, he explained. He spend most of his 
life explaining. In the Student, 2-254, he wrote: "Had the morning of Nov. 
14, 1867 been clear in England, we should have seen the commencement of the 
display, but not its more brilliant part."(3) 

We have had some experience with the "triumphs" of astronomers: we have some 
suspicions as to their greatly advertised accuracy. We shall find out for 
ourselves whether the morning of Nov. 14, 1867 was clear enough in England 
or not. We suspect that it was a charming morning, in England -- 

Monthly Notices, R.A.S.' 28-32:(4) 

Report by E.J. Lowe, Highfield House, night of Nov. 13-14, 1867: 

"Clear at 1.10 A.M.; high, thin cumuli, at 2 A.M., but sky not covered until 
3.10 A.M., and the moon's place visible until 3.55 A.M.; sky not overcast 
until 5.50 A.M." 

The determination of the orbital period of thirty-three years and a quarter, 
but with appearances of a period of thirty-three years, was arrived at by 
Prof. Newton by searching old records, finding that, in an intersection-
period of thirty-three years, there [21/22] had been extraordinary meteoric 
displays, from the year 902 A.D. to the year 1833 A.D.(5) He reminds me of 
an investigator who searched old records for appearances of Halley's comet, 
and found something that he identified as Halley's comet, exactly on time, 
every seventy-five years back to times of the Roman Empire. See the 
Edinburgh Review, vol. 66.(6) It seems that he did not know that orthodoxy 
does not attribute exactly a seventy-five year period to Halley's comet. He 
got what he went looking for, anyway. I have no disposition for us to enjoy 
ourselves at Prof. Newton's expense, because, surely enough, his method, if 
regarded as only experimental, or tentative, is legitimate enough, though 
one does suspect him of very loose behavior in his picking and choosing. But 
Dr. Adams announced that, upon mathematical grounds, he had arrived at the 
same conclusion. 

The test: 

The next return of the Leonids was predicted for November, 1899. 

Memoirs of the British Astronomical Association, 9-6:(7) 

"No meteoric event ever before aroused such widespread interest, or so 
grievously disappointed anticipation." 

There were no Leonids in November, 1899. 

It was explained. They would be seen next year. 

There were no Leonids in November, 1900. 

It was explained. They would be seen next year. 

No Leonids.(8) 

Vaunt and inflation and parade of the symbols of the infinitesimal calculus; 
the pomp of vectors, and the hush that surrounds quaternions: but when an 
axis of co-ordinates loses its rectitude, in the service of a questionable 
selection, disciplined symbols become a rabble. The Most High of Mathematics 
-- and one of his supposed prophets points to the sky. Nowhere near where he 
points, something is found. He points to a date -- nothing happens. 

Prof. Serviss, in Astronomy in a Nutshell, explains.(9) He explains that the 
Leonids did not appear when they should have appeared, because Jupiter and 
Saturn had altered their orbits. 

Back in the times of the Crusades, and nothing was disturb- [22/23] ing the 
Leonids -- and if you're stronger for dates than I am, think of some more 
dates, and nothing was altering the orbit of the Leonids -- discovery of 
America, and the Spanish Armada, in 1588, which, by some freak, I always 
remember, and no effects by Jupiter and Saturn -- French revolution and on 
to the year 1866, and still nothing the matter with the Leonids -- but, once 
removed from "discovery" and "identification," and that's the end of their 
period, diverted by Jupiter and Saturn, old things that had been up in the 
sky at least as long as they had been. If we're going to accept the calculi 
at all, the calculus of probabilities must have a hearing. My own opinion, 
based upon reading many accounts of November meteors, is that decidedly the 
display of 1833 did not repeat in 1866: that a false priest sinned and that 
an equally false highpriest gave him sanction. 

The tragedy goes comically on. I feel that, to all good Neo-astronomers, I 
can recommend the following serenity from an astronomer who was unperturbed 
by what happened to his science, in November, 1899, and some more Novembers 
-- 

Bryant, A History of Astronomy, p. 252:(10) 

That the meteoric display of 1899 had failed to appear -- "as had been 
predicted by Dr. Downing and Dr. Johnstone Stoney." 

One starts to enjoy this disguisement, thinking of virtually all the 
astronomers of the world who had predicted the return of the Leonids, and 
the find, by Bryant, of two who had not, and his recording only the opinion 
of these two, coloring so as to look like another triumph -- but we may 
thank our sorely stimulated suspiciousness for still richer enjoyment -- 

That even these two said no such saving thing -- 

Nature, Nov. 9, 1899:(11) 

Dr. Downing and Dr. Stoney, instead of predicting failure of the Leonids to 
appear, advise watch for them several hours later than had been calculated. 

I conceive of the astronomers' fictitious paradise as malarchitectural with 
corrupted equations, and paved with rotten symbols. Seemingly pure, white 
fountains of formal vanities -- boasts that are gushing from decomposed 
triumphs. We shall find their furnishings shabby with tarnished comets. We 
turn expectantly to the subject of comets; or we turn cynically to [23/24] 
the subject. We turn maliciously to the subject of comets. Nevertheless, 
threading the insecurities of our various feelings, is a motif that is the 
steady essence of Neo-astronomy: 

That, in celestial phenomena, as well as in all other fields of research, 
the irregular, or the unformulable, or the uncapturable, is present in at 
least equal representation with the uniform: that, given any clear, 
definite, seemingly unvarying thing in the heavens, co-existently is 
something of wantonness or irresponsibility, bizarre and incredible, 
according to the standards of purists -- that the science of Astronomy 
concerns itself with only one aspect of existence, because of course there 
can be no science of the obverse phenomena -- which is good excuse for so 
enormously disregarding, if we must have the idea that there are real 
sciences, but which shows the hopelessness of positively attempting. 

The story of the Comets, as not told in Mr. Chambers' book of that title, is 
almost unparalleled in the annals of humiliation. When a comet is predicted 
to return, that means faith in the Law of Gravitation. It is Newtonism that 
comets, as well as planets, obey the Law of Gravitation, and move in one of 
the conic sections. When a comet does not return when it "should," there is 
no refuge for an astronomer to say that planets perturbed it, because one 
will ask why he did not include such factors in his calculations, if these 
phenomena be subject to mathematical treatment.(12) In his book, Mr. 
Chambers avoids, or indicates that he never heard of, a great deal that will 
receive cordiality from us, but he does publish a list of predicted comets 
that did not return. Writing, in 1909, he mentions others for which he had 
hopes:(13) 

Brooks' First Periodic Comet (1886, IV) -- "We must see what the years 1909 
and 1910 bring forth." This is pretty indefinite anticipation -- however, 
nothing was brought forth, according to Monthly Notices, R.A.S., 1909 and 
1910: the Brooks' comet that is recorded is Brooks', 1889. Giacobini's 
Second Periodical Comet (1900, III) -- not seen in 1907 -- "so we shall have 
no chance of knowing anything more about it until 1914." No more known about 
it in 1914. Borelly's Comet (1905, II) -- "Its [24/25] expected return in 
1911, or 1912, will be awaited with interest." This is pretty indefinite 
awaiting: it is now said that this comet did return upon Sept. 19, 1911. 
Denning's Second Periodic Comet (1894, I) -- expected, in 1909, but not seen 
up to Mr. Chambers' time of writing -- no mention in Monthly Notices. 
Swift's Comet, of Nov. 20, 1894 -- "must be regarded as lost, unless it 
should be found in December, 1912." No mention of it in Monthly Notices. 

Three comets were predicted to return in 1913 -- not one of them returned, 
(Monthly Notices, 74-326).(14) 

Once upon a time, armed with some of the best and latest cynicisms, I was 
hunting for prey in the Magazine of Science, and came upon an account of a 
comet that was expected in the year 1848. I supposed that the thing had been 
positively predicted, and very likely failed to appear, and, for such common 
game, had no interest. But I came upon the spoor of disgrace, in the word 
"triumph" -- "If it does come, it will afford another astronomical triumph" 
(Mag. of Sci., 1848-107).(15) The astronomers had predicted the return of 
the great comet in the year 1848.(16) In Monthly Notices, April, 1847, Mr. 
Hind says that the result of his calculations had satisfied him that the 
identification had been complete, and that, in all probability, "the comet 
must be very near."(17) Accepting Prof. Mädler's determinations, he 
predicted that the comet would return to position nearest the sun, about the 
end of February, 1848.(18) 

No comet. 

The astronomers explained. I don't know what the mind of an astronomers 
looks like, but I think of a fizzle with excuses revolving around it. A 
writer in the American Journal of Science, 2-9-442, explains 
excellently.(19) It seems that, when the comet failed to return, Mr. Barber, 
at Etwell, again went over the calculations. He found that, between the 
years 1556 and 1592, the familiar attractions of Jupiter and Saturn had 
diminished the comet's period by 263 days, but that something else had 
wrought an effect that he set down positively at 751 days, with a resulting 
retardation of 488 days. This is magic that would petrify, with chagrin, the 
arteries of the hemorrhagicalest [25/26] statue that ever convinced the 
faithful -- reaching back through three centuries of inter-actions, which, 
without divine insight, are unimaginable when occurring in three seconds -- 

But there was no comet. 

The astronomers explained. They went on calculating, and ten years later 
were still calculating. See Recreative Science, 1860-139.(20) It would be 
heroic were it not mania. What was the matter with Mr. Barber, at Etwell, 
and the intellectual tentacles that he had thrust through centuries is not 
made clear in the most contemporaneous accounts; but, in the year 1857, Mr. 
Hind published a pamphlet and explained. It seems that researches by Littrow 
had given new verification to a path that had been computed for the comet, 
and that nothing had been the matter with Mr. Barber, of Etwell, except his 
insufficiency of data, which had been corrected. Mr. Hind predicted. He 
pointed to the future, but he pointed like someone closing a thumb and 
spreading four fingers. Mr. Hind said that, according to Halley's 
calculations, the comet would arrive in the summer of 1865. However, an 
acceleration of five years had been discovered, so that the time should be 
set down for the middle of August, 1860. However, according to Mr. Hind's 
calculated orbit, the comet might return in the summer of 1864. However, 
allowing for acceleration, "the comet is found to be due early in August, 
1858."(21) 

Then Bomme calculated. He predicted that the comet would return upon August 
2, 1858. 

There was no comet. 

The astronomers went on calculating. They predicted that the comet would 
return on Aug. 22, 1860.(22) 

No comet.(23) 

But I think that a touch of mercy is a luxury that we can afford; anyway, 
we'll have to be merciful or monotonous. For variety we shall switch from a 
comet that did not appear to one that did appear. Upon the night of June 30, 
1861, a magnificent humiliator appeared in the heavens. One of the most 
brilliant luminosities of modern times appeared as suddenly as if it were 
dropped through the shell of our solar system -- if it be a solar system. 
There were letters in the newspapers: correspondents [26/27] wanted to know 
why this extraordinary object had not been seen coming, by astronomers. Mr. 
Hind explained. He wrote that the comet was a small object and consequently 
had not been seen coming by astronomers. No one could deny the magnificence 
of the comet; nevertheless Mr. Hind declared that it was very small, looking 
so large because it was near this earth. This is not the later explanation: 
nowadays it is said that the comet had been in southern skies, where it had 
been observed. All contemporaneous astronomers agreed that the comet had 
come down from the north, and not one of them thought of explaining that it 
had been invisible because it had been in the south. A luminosity, with a 
mist around it, altogether the apparent size of the moon, had burst into 
view. In Recreative Science, 3-143, Webb says that nothing like it had been 
seen since the year 1680.(24) Nevertheless the orthodox pronouncement was 
that the object was small and would fade away as quickly as it had appeared. 
See the Athenaeum, July 6, 1861 -- "So small an object will very soon get 
beyond our view." (Hind)(25) 

Popular Science Review, 1-513:(26) 

That, in April, 1862, the thing was still visible. 

Something else that was seen under circumstances that cannot be considered 
triumphant -- upon Nov. 28, 1872, Prof. Klinkerfues, of Göttingen, looking 
for Biela's comet, saw meteors in the path of the expected comet. He 
telegraphed to Pogson, of Madras, to look near the star Theta Centauri, and 
he would see the comet. I'd not say that this was in the field of magic, but 
it does seem consummate. A dramatic telegram like this electrifies the 
faithful -- an astronomer in the north telling an astronomer in the south 
where to look, so definitely naming one special little star in skies 
invisible in the north. Pogson looked where he was told to look and 
announced that he saw what he was told to see. But at meetings of the R. A. 
S., Jan. 10 and March 14, 1873, Captain Tupman pointed out that, even if 
Biela's comet had appeared, it would have been nowhere near this star. 

Among our later emotions will be indignation against all astronomers who say 
that they know whether stars are approaching or receding. When we arrive at 
that subject it will be the [27/28] preciseness of the astronomers that will 
perhaps inflame us beyond endurance. We note here the far smaller difficulty 
of determining whether a relatively nearby comet is coming or going. Upon 
Nov. 6, 1892, Edwin Holmes discovered a comet. In the Jour. B. A. A., 3-182, 
Holmes writes that different astronomers had calculated its distance from 
twenty million miles to two hundred million miles and had determined its 
diameter to be all the way from twenty-seven thousand miles to three hundred 
thousand miles.(27) Prof. Young said that the comet was approaching; Prof. 
Parkhurst wrote merely that the impression was that the comet was 
approaching the earth; but Prof. Berberich, (Eng. Mec., 56-316) announced 
that, upon Nov. 6, Holmes' comet had been 36,000,000 miles from this earth, 
and 6,000,000 miles away upon the 16th, and that the approach was so rapid 
that, upon the 21st the comet would touch this earth.(28) 

The comet, which had been receding, kept on receding. [28]

1. Olmsted reasoned that the period of the Leonid meteors must be a year or 
a fraction of a year, if the Leonids intersected with the earth's orbit each 
November; and, he calculated that their period could not be a third of a 
year or less. He believed their period to be either a year or half a year 
and favoured the latter period: "...I feel authorized finally to conclude, 
That the meteors of Nov. 13th, consisted of portions of the extreme parts of 
a nebulous body, which revolves around the sun in an orbit interior to that

375 days, and another 33 years. He noticed the advance of the date of the

progression of the node of the orbit. Adams undertook to calculate what the 
amount would be on all five suppositions that had been made about the 
period. After a laborious work, he found that none gave one day in seventy 
years except the 33-year period, which did so exactly. H.A. Newton predicted 
a return of the shower on the night of November 13th-14th, 1866." George

5. H.A. Newton obtained his period of 33-years by mathematical methods; for, 
he divided the difference in years between 1833 and 902 (or 931) by 28 
periods, which equals 33. His explanation of the differences between 
extraordinary displays found in historical records, which were 29 or 34 
years apart (such as were observed in 902 and 931, or in 1799 and 1833), was 
that some were seen at the beginning of a cycle and others at the close of a 
cycle; and, hence, the time in a cycle with extraordinary meteor displays 
might last "at least 2.25 years," and unusual numbers of meteors might be 
seen "through a period of five or six years, at least." Hubert Anson Newton.

deflected the particles away from the Earth by 1,250,000 miles (2 million 
km.). The displays of 1932 and 1933 were not particularly exciting either, 
and many people felt that the Leonids were past their best. However, in 1966 
the greatest meteor display in recorded history was seen by observers in the 
mid-western United States." The non-appearance of the Leonids in 1899 was 
explained, by the gravitational deflection of Jupiter, (which had not done 
much perturbing "back to AD 902"); and, associating these meteor-showers

CHAPTER FOUR





NEVERTHELESS I sometimes doubt that astronomers represent especial 
incompetence. They remind me too much of uplifters and grocers, 
philanthropists, expert accountants, makers of treaties, characters in 
international conferences, psychic researchers, biologists. The astronomers 
seem to me about as capitalists seem to socialists, and about as socialists 
seem to capitalists, or about as Presbyterians seem to Baptists; as 
Democrats seem to Republicans, or as artists of one school seem to artists 
of another school. If the basic fallacies, or the absence of base, in every 
specialization of thought can be seen by the units of its opposition, why 
then we see that all supposed foundations in our whole existence are myths, 
and that all discussion and supposed progress are the conflicts of phantoms 
and the overthrow of old delusions by new delusions. Nevertheless I am 
searching for some wider expression that will rationalize all of us -- 
conceiving that what we call irrationality is our view of parts and 
functions out of relation to an underlying whole; an underlying something 
that is working out its development in terms of planets and acids and bugs, 
rivers and labor unions and cyclones, politicians and islands and 
astronomers. Perhaps we conceive of an underlying nexus in which all things, 
in our existence, are different manifestations -- torn by its hurricanes and 
quaked by the struggles of Labor against Capital -- and then, for the sake 
of balance, requiring relaxations. It has its rougher hoaxes, and some of 
the apes and some of the priests, and philosophers and wart hogs are nothing 
short of horse play; but the astronomers are the ironies of its less 
peasant-like 

moments -- or the deliciousness of pretending to know whether a far-away 
star is approaching or receding, and at the same time exactly predicting 
when a nearby comet, which is receding, will complete its approach. This is 
cosmic playfulness; such pleasantries enable Existence to bear its 
catastrophes. Shattered comets and sickened nations and [29/30] the 
hydrogenic anguishes of the sun -- and there must be astronomers for the 
sake of relaxations. 

It will be important to us that the astronomers shall not be less 
unfortunate in their pronouncements upon motions of the stars than they have 
turned out to be in other respects. Especially disagreeable to us is the 
doctrine that stars are variable because dark companies revolve around them; 
also we prefer to find that nothing fit for matured minds has been 
determined as to stars with light companions that encircle, or revolve with 
them. If silence be the only true philosophy, and if every positive 
assertion be a myth, we should easily find requital for our negative 
preferences. 

Prof. Otto Struve was one of the highest of the astronomic authorities, and 
the faithful attribute triumphs to him. Upon March 19, 1873, Prof. Struve 
announced that he had discovered a companion to the star Procyon. That was 
an interesting observation, but the mere observation was not the triumph. 
Some time before, Prof. Auwers, as credulous, if not jocular, as Newton and 
Leverrier and Adams, had computed the orbit of a hypothetic companion of 
Procyon's. Upon a chart of the stars, he had drawn a circle around Procyon. 
This orbit was calculated in gravitational terms, and a general theme of 
ours is that all such calculations are only ideal, and relate no more to 
stars and planets or anything else than do the spotless theories of 
uplifters to events that occur as spots in the one wide daub of existence. 
Specifically we wish to discredit this "triumph" of Struve's and Auwers', 
but in general we continue our expression that all uses of the calculus of 
celestial mechanics are false applications, and that this subject is for 
æsthetic enjoyment only, and has no place in the science of astronomy, if 
anybody can think that there is such a science. So, after great labor, or 
after considerable enjoyment, Auwers drew a circle around Procyon, and 
announced that that was the orbit of a companion-star. Exactly at the point 
in this circle where it "should" be, upon March 19, 1873, Struve saw a point 
of light which, it may be accepted, sooner or later someone would see. 
According to Agnes Clerke (System of the Stars, p.173) over and over Struve 
watched the point of light, and convinced himself that it moved as it 
"should" move, [30/31] exactly in the calculated orbit.(1) In Reminiscences 
of an Astronomer, p. 138, Prof. Newcomb tells the story.(2) According to 
him, an American astronomer then did more than confirm Struve's 
observations: he not only saw but exactly measured the supposed companion. 

A defect was found between the lenses of Struve's telescope: it was found 
that this telescope showed a similar "companion," about 10" from every large 
star. It was found that the more than "confirmatory" determinations by the 
American astronomer had been upon "a long well known star." (Newcomb)(3) 

Every astronomic triumph is a bright light accompanied by an imbecility, 
which may for a while make it variable with diminishments and then go 
unnoticed. Priestcrafts are not merely tyrannies: they're necessities. There 
must be more reassuring ways of telling this story. The good priest J.E. 
Gore (Studies in Astronomy, p. 104) tells it safely -- not a thing except 
that, in the year 1873, a companion of Procyon's was, by Struve, "strongly 
suspected."(4) Positive assurances of the sciences -- they are islands of 
seeming stability in a cosmic jelly. We shall eclipse the story of Algol 
with some modern disclosures. In all minds not convinced that earnest and 
devoted falsifiers are holding back Development, the story, if remembered at 
all, will soon renew its fictitious lustre. We are centers of tremors in a 
quaking black jelly. A bright and shining delusion looks like beaconed 
security. 

Sir Robert Ball, in the Story of the Heavens, says that the period in which 
Algol blinks his magnitudes is 2 days, 20 hours, 48 minutes and 55 
seconds.(5) He gives the details of Prof. Vogel's calculations upon a speck 
of light and an invisibility. It is god-like command that out of the 
variations of light shall come the diameters of faint appearances and the 
distance and velocity of the unseeable -- that the diameter of the point of 
light is 1,054,000 miles, and that the diameter of the imperceptibility is 
825,000 miles, and that their centers are 3,220,000 miles apart: orbital 
velocity of Algol, 26 miles a second, and the orbital velocity of the 
companion, 55 miles a second -- should be stated 26.3 miles and 55.4 miles a 
second (Proctor, Old and New Astronomy, p. 773).(6) [31/32] 

We come to a classic imposition like this, and at first we feel helpless. We 
are told that this thing is so. It is as if we were modes of motion and must 
go on, but are obstructed by an absolute bar of ultimate steel, shining, in 
our way, with an infinite polish. 

But all appearances are illusions. 

No one with a microscope doubts this; no one who has gone specially from 
ordinary beliefs into minuter examination of any subject doubts this, as to 
his own specific experience -- so then, broadly, that all appearances are 
illusions, and that, by this recognition, we shall dissipate resistances, 
monsters, dragons, oppressors that we shall meet in our pilgrimage. This 
bar-like calculation is itself a mode of motion. The static cannot 
absolutely resist the dynamic, because in the act of resisting it becomes 
itself proportionately the dynamic. We learn that modifications rusted into 
the steel of our opposition. The period of Algol, which Vogel carried out to 
a minute's 55th second, was, after all, so incompetently determined that the 
whole impression was nullified -- 

Astronomical Journal, 11-113:(7) 

That, according to Chandler, Algol and his companion do not revolve around 
each other merely, but revolve together around some second imperceptibility 
-- regularly. 

Bull. Soc. Astro. de France, Oct., 1910:(8) 

That M. Mora has shown that in Algol's variations there were irregularities 
that neither Vogel nor Chandler had accounted for. 

The Companion of Sirius looms up to our recognition that the story must be 
nonsense, or worse than nonsense -- or that two light comedies will now 
disappear behind something darker. The story of the Companion of Sirius is 
that Prof. Auwers, having observed, or in his mania for a pencil and 
something to scribble upon, having supposed he had observed, motions of the 
star Sirius, had deduced the existence of a companion, and had inevitably 
calculated its orbit. Early in the year 1862, Alvan Clark Jr. turned his new 
telescope upon Sirius, and there, precisely where, according to Auwers' 
calculations, it should be, saw the companion. The story is told by Proctor, 
writing thirty years later: the finding of the companion, in the "precise 
position of the calculations"; [32/33] Proctor's statement that, in the 
thirty years following, the companion had "conformed fairly well with the 
calculated orbit."(9) 

According to the Annual Record of Science and Industry, 1876-18, the 
companion, in half the time mentioned by Proctor, had not moved in the 
calculated orbit.(10) In the Astronomical Register, 15-186, there are two 
diagrams by Flammarion: one is the orbit of the companion, as computed by 
Auwers; the other is the orbit, according to a mean of many 
observations.(11) They do not conform fairly well. They do not conform at 
all. 

I am now temporarily accepting that Flammarion and the other observing 
astronomers are right, and that the writers like Proctor, who do not say 
that they made observations of their own, are wrong, though I have data for 
thinking that there is no such companion-star. When Clark turned his 
telescope upon Sirius, the companion was found exactly where Auwers said it 
would be found. According to Flammarion and the other astronomers, had he 
looked earlier or later it would not have been in this position. Then, in 
the name of the one calculus that astronomers seem never to have heard of, 
by what circumstances could that star have been precisely where it should 
be, when looked for, Jan. 31, 1862, if upon all other occasions, it would 
not be where it should be? 

Astronomical Register, 1-94:(12) 

A representation of Sirius -- but with six small stars around him -- an 
account, by Dr. Dawes, of observations, by Goldschmidt, upon the "companion" 
and five other small stars near Sirius. Dr. Dawes' accusation, or opinion, 
is that it scarcely seems possible that some of these other stars were not 
seen by Clark. If Alvan Clark saw six stars, at various distances from 
Sirius, and picked out the one that was at the required distance, as if that 
were the only one, he dignifies our serials with a touch of something other 
than comedy. For Goldschmidt's own announcement, see Monthly Notices, R. A. 
S., 23-181, 243.(13) [33]

hours, 48 minutes and 55 seconds; but, the period given by Fort is the 
correct figure, as stated by most astronomers, (or 2.867 days). The extreme 
accuracy claimed by H.C. Vogel failed to take into consideration further 
variations, beyond the simple hypothesis of an eclipsing binary system. 
There was a difference of 6 seconds in the period between its measurements 
by Goodricke in 1782 and by Argelander in 1855; and, these variations 
occurred with some regularity over a 680 day period, which suggested the 
existence of a third star (Algol C). These variations were not enough to be 
explained by eclipses, thus a stream of matter is believed to be flowing 
from Algol B (a darker subgiant star) to Algol A (the brighter dwarf star); 
and, further variations over 32-year and 180-year periods have suggested the 
existence of Algol D and Algol E (neither of which has been detected), 
magnetic cycles (such as occur in sunspot cycles), apsidal motion produced 
by Algol C, or variations in the transfer of mass from Algol B to Algol A.

CHAPTER FIVE





SMUGNESS and falseness and sequences of re-adjusting fatalities -- and yet 
so great is the hypnotic power of astronomic science that it can outlive its 
"mortal" blows by the simple process of forgetting them, and, in general, 
simply by denying that it can make mistakes. Upon page 245, Old and New 
Astronomy, Richard Proctor says -- "The ideas of astronomers on these 
questions of distance have not changed, and in the present position of 
astronomy, based (in such respects) on absolute demonstration, they cannot 
change."(1) 

Sounds that have roared in the sky, and their vibrations have shaken down 
villages -- if these be the voices of Development, commanding that opinions 
shall change, we shall learn what will become of the Proctors and their 
"absolute demonstrations." Lights that have appeared in the sky -- that they 
are gleams upon the armament of Marching Organization. "There can only be 
one explanation of meteors" -- I think it is that they are shining 
spearpoints of slayers of dogmas. I point to the sky over a little town in 
Perthshire, Scotland -- there may be a new San Salvador -- it may be a new 
Plymouth Rock. I point to the crater Aristarchus, of the moon -- there, for 
more than a century, a lighthouse may have been signalling. Whether out of 
profound meditations, or farrago and bewilderment, I point, directly, or 
miscellaneously, and, if only a few of the multitude of data be accepted, 
unformulable perturbations rack an absolute sureness, and the coils of our 
little horizons relax their constrictions. 

I indicate that, in these pages, which are banners in a cosmic procession, I 
do feel a sense of responsibility, but how to maintain any great seriousness 
I do not know, because still is our subject astronomical "triumphs." 

Once upon a time there was a young man, aged eighteen, whose name was 
Jeremiah Horrox. He was no astronomer. He was interested in astronomic 
subjects, but it may be that we shall agree [34/35] that a young man of 
eighteen, who had not been heard of by one astronomer of his time, was an 
outsider. There was a transit of Venus in December, 1639, but not a grown-up 
astronomer in the world expected it, because the not always great and 
infallible Kepler had predicted the next transit of Venus for the year 1761. 
According to Kepler, Venus would pass below the sun in December, 1639. But 
there was another calculation: it was by the great, but sometimes not so 
great, Lansberg: that, in December, 1639, Venus would pass over the upper 
part of the sun. Jeremiah Horrox was an outsider. He was able to reason 
that, if Venus could not pass below the sun, and also over the upper part of 
the sun, she might take a middle course. Venus did pass over the middle part 
of the sun's disc; and Horrox reported the occurrence, having watched it.(2) 

I suppose this was one of the most agreeable humiliations in the annals of 
busted inflations. One thinks sympathetically of the joy that went out from 
seventeenth-century Philistines. The story is told to this day by the 
Proctors and Balls and Newcombs: the way they tell this story of the boy who 
was able to conclude that something could not occupy two extremes might be 
intermediate, and thereby see something that no professional observer of the 
time saw, is a triumph of absorption: 

That the transit of Venus, in December, 1639, was observed by Jeremiah 
Horrox, "the great astronomer."(3) 

We shall make some discoveries as we go along, and some of them will be 
worse thought of than others, but there is a discovery here that may be of 
interest: the secret of immortality -- that there is a mortal resistance to 
everything; but that the thing that can keep on incorporating, or 
assimilating within itself, its own mortal resistances, will live forever. 
By its absorptions, the science of astronomy perpetuates its inflations, but 
there have been instances of indigestion. See the New York Herald, Sept. 16, 
1909.(4) Here Flammarion, who probably no longer asserts any such thing, 
claims Dr. Cook's "discovery of the north pole" as an "astronomical 
conquest." Also there are other ways. One suspects that the treatment that 
Dr. Lescarbault received from Flammarion illustrates other ways. 

In the year 1859, it seems that Dr. Lescarbault was some- [35/36] thing of 
an astronomer. It seems that as far back as that he may have known a planet 
when he saw one, because, in an interview, he convinced Leverrier that he 
did know a planet when he saw one. He had at least heard of the planet 
Venus, because in the year 1882 he published a paper upon indications that 
Venus has an atmosphere.(5) Largely because of an observation, or an 
announcement, of his, occurred the climax of Leverrier's fiascos: prediction 
of an intra-Mercurial planet that did not appear when it "should" appear. My 
suspicion is that astronomers pardonably, but frailly, had it in for 
Lescarbault, and that in the year 1891 came an occurrence that one of them 
made an opportunity. Early in the year 1891, Dr. Lescarbault announced that, 
upon the night of Jan. 11, 1891, he had seen a new star.(6) At the next 
meeting of the French Academy, Flammarion rose, spoke briefly, and sat down 
without over-doing. He said that Lescarbault had "discovered" Saturn.(7) 

If a navigator of at least thirty years' experience should announced that he 
had discovered an island, and if that island should turn out to be Bermuda, 
he would pair with Lescarbault -- as Flammarion made Lescarbault appear. 
Even though I am a writer upon astronomical subjects, myself, I think that 
even I should know Saturn, if I should see him, at least in such a period as 
the year 1891, when the rings were visible. It is perhaps an incredible 
mistake. However, it will be agreeable to some of us to find that 
astronomers have committed just such almost incredible mistakes -- 

In Cosmos, n.s., 42-467, is a list of astronomers who reported "unknown" 
dark bodies that they had seen crossing the disc of the sun:(8) 



La Concha ..... Montevideo ..... Nov. 5, 1789; 

Keyser ........ Amsterdam ...... Nov. 9, 1802; 

Fisher ........ Lisbon ......... May 5, 1832; 

Houzeau ....... Brussels ....... May 8, 1845. 



According to the Nautical Almanac, the planet Mercury did cross the disc of 
the sun upon these dates.(9) 

It is either that the Flammarions do so punish those who see [36/37] the new 
and the undesired, or that astronomers do "discover" Saturn, and do not know 
Mercury when they see him -- and that Buckle overlooked something when he 
wrote that only the science of history attracts inferior minds often not fit 
even for clergymen.(10) 

Whatever we think of Flammarion, we admire his deftness. But we shall have 
an English instance of the ways in which Astronomy maintains itself and 
controls those who say they see that which the "should" not see, which does 
seem beefy. One turns the not very attractive-looking pages of the English 
Mechanic, 1893, casually, perhaps, at any rate in no expectations of 
sensations -- glaring at one, a sketch of such a botanico-pathologic 
monstrosity as a musk melon with rows of bunions on it (English Mechanic, 
Oct. 20, 1893).(11) The reader is told, by Andrew Barclay, F.R.A.S., 
Kilmarnock, Scotland, that this enormity is the planet Jupiter, according to 
the speculum of his Gregorian telescope. 

In the next issue of the English Mechanic, Capt. Noble, F.R.A.S., writes, 
gently enough, that, if he had such a telescope, he would dispose of the 
optical parts for whatever they would bring, and make a chimney cowl of the 
tube.(12) 

English Mechanic, 1893-2-309 -- the planet Mars, by Andrew Barclay -- a dark 
sphere, surrounded by a thick ring of lighter material; attached to it, 
another sphere, of half its diameter -- a sketch as gross and repellent to a 
conventionalist as the museum-freak, in whose body the head of a dangling 
twin is embedded, its dwarfed body lopping out from his side.(13) There is a 
description by Mr. Barclay, according to whom the main body is red and the 
proturberance blue. 

Captain Noble -- "Preposterous...last straw that breaks the camel's 
back!"(14) 

Mr. Barclay comes back with some new observations upon Jupiter's lumps, and 
then in the rest of the volume is not heard from again.(15) One reads on, 
interested in quieter matters, and gradually forgets the controversy -- 

English Mechanic, August 23, 1897:(16) 

A gallery of monstrosities: Andrew Barclay, signing himself "F.R.A.S.," 
exhibiting: [37/38] 

The planet Jupiter, six times encircled with lumps; afflicted Mars, with his 
partly embedded twin reduced in size, but still a distress to all properly 
trained observers; the planet Saturn, shaped like a mushroom with a ring 
around it. 

Captain Noble -- "Mr. Barclay is not a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical 
Society, and, were the game worth the candle, might be restrained by 
injunction from so describing himself!"(17) And upon page 362, of this 
volume of the English Mechanic, Captain Noble calls the whole matter "a 
pseudo F. R. A. S.'s crazy hallucinations."(18) 

Lists of the Fellows of the Royal Astronomical Society, from June, 1875, to 
June, 1896: 

"Barclay, Andrew, Kilmarnock, Scotland; elected Feb. 8, 1856." 

I cannot find the list for 1897 in the libraries. List for 1898 -- Andrew 
Barclay's name omitted.(19) Thou shalt not see lumps on Jupiter. 

Every one of Barclay's observations has something to support it. All 
conventional representations of Jupiter show encirclements by strings of 
rotundities that we are told are cloud-forms, but, in the Jour. B.A.A., Dec. 
1910, is published a paper by Dr. Downing, entitled: "Is Jupiter Humpy?" 
suggesting that various phenomena upon Jupiter agree with the idea that 
there are protuberances upon the planet.(20) A common appearance, said to be 
an illusion, is Saturn as an oblong, if not mushroom-shaped; see any good 
index for observations upon the "square-shouldered aspect" of Saturn. In 
L'Astronomie, 1889-135, is a sketch of Mars, according to Fontana, in the 
year 1636 -- a sphere enclosed in a ring; in the center of the sphere a 
great protruding body, said, by Fontana, to have looked like a vast, black 
cone.(21) 

But, whether this or that should amuse or enrage us, should be accepted or 
rejected, is not to me the crux; but Andrew Barclay's own opening words are: 

That, through a conventional telescope, conventional appearances are seen, 
and that a telescope is tested by the conventionality of its disclosures; 
but that there may be new optical principles, or applications, that may be, 
to the eye and the present telescope, what once the conventional telescope 
was to the eye -- in times [38/39] when scientists refused to look at the 
preposterous, enraging, impossible moons of Jupiter. 

In the English Mechanic, 33-327, is a letter from the astronomer, A. Stanley 
Williams.(22) He had written previously upon double stars, their colors an 
magnitudes. Another astronomer, Herbert Sadler, had pointed out some errors. 
Mr. Williams acknowledges the errors, saying that some were his own, and 
that some were from Smyth's Cycle of Celestial Objects.(23) In the English 
Mechanic, 33-377, Sadler says that, earnestly, he would advise Williams not 
to use the new edition of Smyth's Cycle, because, with the exception of vol. 
40, Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society, "a more disgracefully 
inaccurate" catalogue of double stars had never been published.(24) "If," 
says one astronomer to the other astronomer, "you have a copy of this 
miserable publication, sell it for waste paper. It is crammed with the most 
stupid errors." 

A new character appears. He is George F. Chambers, F.R.A.S., author of a 
long list of astronomical works, and a tract entitled, Where Are You Going, 
Sunday?(25) He, too, is earnest. In this early correspondence, nothing 
ulterior is apparent, and we suppose that it is in the cause of Truth that 
he is so earnest. Says one astronomer that the other astronomer is 
"evidently one of those self-sufficient young men, who are nothing, if not 
abusive." But can Mr. Sadler have so soon forgotten what was done to him, on 
a former occasion, after he had slandered Admiral Smyth? Chambers challenges 
Sadler to publish a list of, say, fifty "stupid errors" in the book. He 
quotes the opinion of the Astronomer Royal: that the book was a work of 
"sterling merit." "Airy vs. Sadler," he says: "which is it to be?"(26) 

We began not very promisingly. Few excitements seemed to lurk in such a 
subject as double stars, their colors and magnitudes; but slander and abuse 
are livelier, and now enters curiosity: we'd like to know what was done to 
Herbert Sadler. 

Late in the year 1876, Herbert Sadler was elected Fellow of the Royal 
Astronomical Society.(27) In Monthly Notices, R.A.S., Jan., 1879, appears 
his first paper that was read to the Society: Notes on the late Admiral 
Smyth's Cycle of Celestial Objects, [39/40] volume second, known as the 
Bedford Catalogue.(28) With no especial vehemence, at least according to our 
own standards of repression, Sadler expresses himself upon some 
"extraordinary mistakes" in this work. 

At the meeting of the Society, May 9, 1879, there was an attack upon Sadler, 
and it was led by Chambers, or conducted by Chambers, who cried out that 
Sadler had slandered a great astronomer and demanded that Sadler should 
resign. In the report of this meeting, published in the Observatory, there 
is not a trace of anybody's endeavors to find out whether there were errors 
in this book or not: Chambers ignored everything but his accusation of 
slander, and demanded again that Sadler should resign.(29) In Monthly 
Notices, 39-389, the Council of the Society published regrets that it had 
permitted publication of Sadler's paper, "which was entirely unsupported by 
the citation of instances upon which his judgment was founded."(30) 

We find that it was Mr. Chambers who had revised and published the new 
edition of Smyth's Cycle. 

In the English Mechanic, Chambers challenged Sadler to publish, say, fifty 
"stupid errors."(31) See page 451, vol. 33, English Mechanic -- Sadler lists 
just fifty "stupid errors."(32) He says that he could have listed, not 50, 
but 250, not trivial, but of the "grossest kind." He says that in one set of 
167 observations, 117 were wrong. 

The English Mechanic drops out of this comedy with the obvious title, but 
developments go on. Evidently withdrawing its "regrets," the Council 
permitted publication of a criticism of Chambers' edition of Smyth's Cycle, 
in Monthly Notices, 40-497, and the language in this criticism, by S.W. 
Burnham, was no less interpretable as slanderous than was Sadler's: that 
Smyth's data were "either roughly approximate or grossly incorrect, and so 
constantly recurring that it was impossible to explain that they were 
ordinary errors of observation."(33) Burnham lists 30 pages of errors. 

Following is a paper by E.B. Knobel, who published 17 pages of instances in 
which, in his opinion, Mr. Burnham had been too severe.(34) Knowing of no 
objection by Burnham to this reduction, we have left 13 pages of stupid 
errors in one standard astronomical [40/41] work, which may fairly be 
considered as representative of astronomical work in general, inasmuch as it 
was, in the opinion of the Astronomer Royal, a book of "sterling merit." 

I think that now we have accomplished something. After this we should all 
get along more familiarly and agreeably together. Thirteen pages of errors 
in one standard astronomical work are reassuring; there is a likeable 
fallibility here that should make for better relations. If the astronomers 
were what they think they are, we might as well make squeaks of disapproval 
against Alpine summits. As to astronomers who calculate positions of planets 
-- of whom he was one -- Newcomb, in Reminiscences of an Astronomer, says -- 
"The men who have done it are therefore, in intellect, the select few of the 
human race, -- an aristocracy above all others in the scale of being."(35) 
We could never get along comfortably with such awful selectness as that. We 
are grateful to Mr. Sadler, in the cause of more comfortable relations. [41]

CHAPTER SIX





ENGLISH MECHANIC, 56-184:(1) 

That, upon April 25, 1892, Archdeacon Nouri climbed Mt. Ararat. It was his 
hope that he should find something of archæologic compensation for his 
clambering. He found Noah's Ark. 

About the same time, Dr. Holden, Director of the Lick Observatory, was 
watching one of the polished and mysterious-looking instruments that, in the 
new ikonology, have replaced the images of the saints. Dr. Holden was 
awaiting the appointed moment of the explosion of a large quantity of 
dynamite in San Francisco Bay. The moment came. The polished little "saint" 
revealed to the faithful scientist. He wrote an account of the record, and 
sent copies to the San Francisco newspapers. Then he learned the dynamite 
had not been fired off. He sent a second messenger after the first 
messenger, and, because messengers sometimes have velocities proportional to 
urgencies -- "the Observatory escaped ridicule by a narrow margin." See the 
Observatory, 20-467.(2) This revelation came from Prof. Colton, who, though 
probably faithful to all the "saints," did not like Dr. Holden. 

The system that Archdeacon Nouri represented lost its power because its 
claims exceeded all conceivableness, and because, in other respects, of its 
inertness to the obvious. The system that Dr. Holden represented is not 
different: there is the same seeing of whatever may be desirable, and the 
same profound meditations upon the remote, with the same inattention to 
fairly acceptable starting-points. The astronomers like to tell audiences of 
just what gases are burning in an unimaginably remote star, but have never 
reasonably made acceptable, for instance, that this earth is round, to start 
with. Of course I do not mean to say that this, or anything else, can be 
positively proved, but it is depressing to [42/43] hear it said, so 
authoritatively, that the round shadow of this earth upon the moon proves 
that the earth is round, whereas records of angular shadows are common, and 
whereas, if this earth were a cube, its straight sides would cast a rounded 
shadow upon the convex moon. That the first part of a receding vessel to 
disappear should be the lower part may be only such an illusion of 
perspective as that by which railroad tracks seem to dip toward each other 
in the distance. Meteors sometimes appear over one part of the horizon and 
then seem to curve down behind the opposite part of the horizon, whereas 
they describe no such curve, because to a string of observers each observer 
is at the center of the seeming curve. 

Once upon a time -- about the year 1870 -- occurred an unusual sporting 
event. John Hampden, who was noted for his piety and his bad language, whose 
avowed purpose was to support the principles of this earth's earliest 
geodesist, offered to bet five hundred pounds that he could prove the 
flatness of this earth. Somewhere in England is the Bedford Canal, and along 
a part of it is a straight, unimpeded view, six miles in length. Orthodox 
doctrine -- or the doctrine of the newer orthodoxy, because John Hampden 
considered that he was orthodox -- is that the earth's curvature is 
expressible in the formula of 8 inches for the first mile and then the 
square of the distance times 8 inches. For two miles, then, the square of 2, 
or 4, times 8 inches. An object six miles away should be depressed 288 
inches, or, allowing for refraction, according to Proctor (Old and New 
Astronomy) 216 inches.(3) Hampden said that an object six miles away, upon 
this part of the Bedford Canal, was not depressed as it "should" be. Dr. 
Alfred Russell Wallace took up the bet. Mr. Walsh, Editor of the Field, was 
the stakeholder. A procession went to the Bedford Canal. Objects were looked 
at through telescopes, or looked for, and the decision was that Hampden had 
lost. There was rejoicing in the fold of the chosen, though Hampden, in one 
of his furious bombardments of verses from the Bible, charged conspiracy and 
malfeasance and confiscation, and what else I don't know, piously and 
intemperately declaring that he had been defrauded.(4) 

In the English Mechanic, 80-40, some one writes to find out [43/44] about 
the "Bedford Canal Experiment."(5) We learn that the experiment had been 
made again. The correspondent writes that, if there were basis to the rumors 
that he had heard, there must be something wrong with the established 
doctrine. Upon page 138, Lady Blount answers -- that, upon May 11, 1904, she 
had gone to the Bedford Canal, accompanied by Mr. E. Clifton, a well-known 
photographer, who was himself uninfluenced by her motives, which were the 
familiar ones of attempting to restore the old gentleman who first took up 
the study of geodesy.(6) However, she seethes with neither piety nor 
profanity. She says that, with his telescopic camera, Mr. Clifton had 
photographed a sheet, six miles away, though by conventional theory the 
sheet should have been invisible. In a later number of the English Mechanic, 
a reproduction of this photograph is published.(7) According to this 
evidence this earth is flat, or is a sphere enormously greater than is 
generally supposed. But at the 1901 meeting of the British Association for 
the Advancement of Science, Mr. H. Yule Oldham read a paper upon his 
investigations at the Bedford Canal.(8) He, too, showed photographs. In his 
photographs, everything that should have been invisible was invisible. 

I accept that anybody who is convinced that still are there relics upon Mt. 
Ararat, has only to climb Mt. Ararat, and he must find something that can be 
said to be part of Noah's Ark, petrified perhaps. If someone else should be 
convinced that a mistake has been made, and that the mountain is really 
Pike's Peak, he has only to climb Pike`s Peak and prove that the most 
virtuous of all lands was once the Holy Land. The meaning that I read in the 
whole subject is that, in this Dark Age that we're living in, not even such 
rudimentary matters as the shape of this earth have ever been investigated 
except now and then to support somebody's theory, because astronomers have 
instinctively preferred the remote and the not so easily understandable and 
the safe from external inquiry. In Earth Features and Their Meaning, Prof. 
Hobbs says that this earth is top-shaped, quite as the sloping extremities 
of Africa and South America suggest.(9) According to Prof. Hobbs, 
observations upon the pendulum suggest this earth is shaped like a top.(10) 
Some years ago, Dr. Gregory read a paper at a meeting of the Royal 
Geographical So- [44/45] ciety, giving data to support the theory of a top-
shaped earth.(11) In the records of the Society, one may read a report of 
the discussion that followed. There was no ridiculing. The President of the 
Society closed the discussion with virtual endorsement, recalling that it 
was Christopher Columbus who first said that this earth is top-shaped. For 
other expressions of this revolt against ancient dogmas, see Bull. Soc. 
Astro. de France, 17-315; 18-143; Pop. Sci. News, 31-234; Eng. Mec., 77-159; 
and, Sci. Amer., 100-441.(12) 

As to the supposed motions of this earth, axial and orbital, circumstances 
are the same, despite the popular supposition that the existence of these 
motions has been established by syntheses of data and by unanswerable logic. 
All scientists, philosophers, religionists, are today looking back, 
wondering what could have been the matter with their predecessors to permit 
them to believe what they did believe. Granted that there will be posterity, 
we shall be predecessors. Then what is it that is conventionally taught 
today that will in the future seem as imbecilic as to all present 
orthodoxies seem the vaporings of preceding systems? 

Well, for instance, that it is this earth that moves, though the sun seems 
to, by the same illusion by which passengers on a boat, the shore seems to 
move, though it is the boat that is moving. 

Apply this reasoning to the moon. The moon seems to move around the earth -- 
but to passengers on a boat, the shore seems to move, whereas it is the boat 
that is moving -- therefore the moon does not move. 

As to the motions of the planets and stars that co-ordinate with the idea of 
a moving earth -- they co-ordinate equally well with the idea of a 
stationary earth. 

In the system that was conceived by Copernicus I find nothing that can be 
said to resemble foundation: nothing but the appeal of greater simplicity. 
An earth that rotates and revolves is simpler to conceive of than is a 
stationary earth with a rigid composition of stars, swinging around it, 
stars kept apart by some unknown substance, or inter-repulsion. But all 
those who think that simplification is a standard to judge by are referred 
to Herbert Spencer's compilations of data indicating that advancing 
knowledge complicates, making, then, complexity, and [45/46] not simplicity, 
the standard by which to judge the more advanced. My own acceptance is that 
there are fluxes one way and then the other way: that the Ptolemaic system 
was complex and was simplified; that, out of what was once a clarification, 
new complications have arisen, and that again will come flux toward 
simplification or clarification -- that the simplification by Copernicus has 
now developed into an incubus of unintelligibilities revolving around a 
farrago of inconsistencies, to which the complexities of Ptolemy are clear 
geometry: miracles, incredibilities, puerilities; tottering deductions 
depending upon flimsy agreements; brutalized observations that are slaves to 
infatuated principles -- 

And one clear call that is heard above the rumble of readjusting collapses -
- the call for a Neo-astronomy -- it may not be our Neo-astronomy. 

Prof. Young, for instance, in his Manual of Astronomy, says that there are 
no common, obvious proofs that the earth moves around the sun, but that 
there are three abstrusities, all of modern determination.(13) Then, if 
Copernicus founded the present system, he founded upon nothing. He had 
nothing to base upon. He either never heard of, or could detect one of these 
abstrusities. All his logic represented in his reasoning upon this earth's 
rotundity: that this earth is round, because of a general tendency to 
sphericity, manifesting, for instance, in fruits and in drops of water -- 
showing that he must have been unaware not only of abstrusities, but of 
icicles and bananas and oysters. It is not that I am snobbishly deriding the 
humble and more than questionable ancestry of modern astronomy. I am 
pointing out that a doctrine came into existence with nothing for a 
foundation: not a datum, not one observation to found upon; no astronomical 
principles, no mechanical principles to justify it. Our inquiry will be as 
to how, in the annals of false architecture, it could ever be said that -- 
except miraculously, of course -- a foundation was subsequently slipped 
under this baseless structure, dug under, rammed under, or God knows how 
devised and fashioned. [46]

CHAPTER SEVEN





THE three abstrusities: 

The aberration of light, the annual parallax of the stars; and, the regular, 
annual shift of the lines of the stellar spectra. 

By the aberration of light is meant a displacement of all stars, during a 
year's observation, by which stars near the pole of the ecliptic describe 
circles, stars are nearer the ecliptic describe ellipses, and the stars of 
the ecliptic, only little straight lines. It is supposed that light has 
velocity, and that these forms represent the ratio between the velocity of 
light and the supposed velocity of this earth in its orbit. In the year 
1725, Bradley conceived of the present orthodox explanation of the 
aberration-forms of the stars: that they reflect or represent the path that 
this earth traverses around the sun, as it would look from the stars, 
appearing virtually circular from stars in the pole of the ecliptic, for 
instance.(1) In Bradley's day there were no definite delusions as to the 
traversing by this earth of another path in space, as part of a whole moving 
system, so Bradley felt simple and satisfied. About a century later by some 
of the most amusing reasoning that one could be entertained with, 
astronomers decided that the whole supposed solar system is moving, at a 
rate of about 13 miles per second from the region of Sirius to a point near 
Vega, all this occurring in northern skies, because southern astronomers had 
not very much to say at that time. Now, then, if at one time in the year, 
and in one part of its orbit, the earth is moving in the direction in which 
the whole solar system is moving, there we have this earth traversing a 
distance that is the sum of its own motion and the general motion; then when 
the earth rounds about and retraces, there we have its own velocity minus 
the general velocity. The first abstrusity, then, is knocked flat on its 
technicalities, because the aberration-forms, then, do not reflect the 
annual motion of this earth: if, in conventional terms, though the path of 
this earth is circular or elliptic relatively to the sun, [47/48] when 
compounding with solar motion it is not so formed relatively to stars; and 
there will have to be another explanation for the aberration-forms.(2) 

The second supposed proof that this earth moves around the sun is in the 
parallax of the stars. In conventional terms, it is said that opposite 
points in this earth's orbit are 185,000,000 miles apart. It is said that 
stars, so differently viewed, are minutely displaced against their 
backgrounds. Again solar-motion -- if, in conventional terms, this earth has 
been traveling, as part of the solar system, from Sirius, toward Vega, in 
2,000 years this earth has traveled 819,936,000,000 miles. This distance is 
4,500 times the distance that is the base line for orbital parallax. Then 
displacement of the stars by solar-motion parallax in 2,000 years, should be 
4,500 times the displacement by orbital parallax, in one year.(3) Give to 
orbital parallax as minute a quantity as is consistent with the claims made 
for it, and 4,500 times that would dent the Great Dipper and nick the Sickle 
of Leo, and perhaps make the Dragon look like a dragon. But not a star in 
the heavens has changed more than doubtfully since the stars were catalogued 
by Hipparchus, 2,000 years ago. If, then, there be minute displacements of 
stars that are attributed to orbital parallax, they will have to be 
explained in some other way, if evidently the sun does not move from Sirius 
toward Vega, and if then, quite as reasonably, this earth may not move. 

Prof. Young's third "proof" is spectroscopic. 

To what degree can spectroscopy in astronomy be relied upon? 

Bryant, A History of Astronomy, p. 206:(4) 

That, according to Bélopolsky, Venus rotates in about 24 hours, as 
determined by the spectroscope; that, according to Dr. Slipher, Venus 
rotates in about 225 days, as determined by the spectroscope. 

According to observations too numerous to make it necessary to cite any, the 
seeming motion of the stars, occulted by the moon, show that the moon has 
atmosphere. According to the spectroscope, there is no atmosphere upon the 
moon, (Pubs. Astro. Soc. Pacific, vol. 6, no. 37).(5) 

The ring of light around Venus, during the transits of 1874 and 1882, 
indicated that Venus has atmosphere.(6) Most astronomers [48/49] say that 
Venus has an atmosphere of extreme density, obscuring the features of the 
planet. According to spectrum analysis, by Sir William Huggins, Venus has no 
atmosphere, (Eng. Mec., 4-22).(7) 

In the English Mechanic, 89-439, are published results of spectroscopic 
examinations of Mars, by Director Campbell, of the Lick Observatory: that 
there is no oxygen, and that there is no water vapor on Mars.(8) In Monthly 
Notices, R.A.S., 27-178, are published results of spectroscopic examinations 
of Mars by Huggins: abundance of oxygen; same vapors as the vapors of this 
earth.(9) These are the amusements of our Pilgrim's Progress, which has new 
San Salvadors for its goals, or new Plymouth Rocks for its expectations -- 
but the experiences of pilgrims have variety -- 

In 1895, at the Allegheny Observatory, Prof. Keeler undertook to determine 
the rotation-period of Saturn's rings, by spectroscopy. It is gravitational 
gospel that particles upon the outside of the rings move at a rate of 10.69 
miles a second; particles upon the inner edge, 13.01 miles a second. Prof. 
Keeler's determinations were what Sir Robert Ball calls "brilliant 
confirmation of the mathematical deduction."(10) Prof. Keeler announced that 
according to the spectroscope, the outside particles of the rings of Saturn 
move at the rate of 10.1 miles a second, and that the inner particles move 
at a rate of 12.4 miles a second -- "as they ought to," says Prof. Young, in 
his gospel, Elements of Astronomy.(11) 

One reads of a miracle like this, the carrying out into decimals of 
different speeds of different particles in parts of a point of light, the 
parts of which cannot be seen at all without a telescope, whereby they seem 
to constitute a solid motionless structure, and one admires, or one 
worships, according to one's inexperience -- 

Or there comes upon one a sense of imposture and imposition that is not very 
bearable. Imposition or imposture or captivation -- and it's as if we've 
been trapped and have been put into a revolving cage, some of the bars 
revolving at unthinkable speed, and other bars of it going around still 
faster, even though not conceivable. Disbelieve as we will, deride and 
accuse, and think of all the other false demonstrations that we have 
encountered, [49/50] as we will -- there's a buzz of the bars that encircle 
us. The concoction that has caged us is one of the most brilliant harlots in 
modern prostitution: we're imprisoned at the pleasure of a favorite in the 
harem of the God of Gravitation. That's some relief: language always is -- 
but how are we to "determine" that the rings of Saturn do not move as they 
"ought" to, and thereby add more to the discrediting of spectroscopy in 
astronomy? 

A gleam on a planet that's like shine on a sword to deliver us -- 

The White Spot of Saturn -- 

A bright and shining deliverer. 

There's a gleam that will shatter concoctions and stop velocities. There's a 
shining thing on the planet Saturn, and the blow that it shines is 
lightning. Thus far has gone a revolution of 10.1 miles a second, but it 
stops by magic against magic; no farther buzzes a revolution of 12.4 miles a 
second -- that the rings of Saturn may not move as, to flatter one little 
god they "ought" to, because, by the handiwork of Universality, they may be 
motionless. 

Often has a white spot been seen upon the rings of Saturn: by Schmidt, Bond, 
Seechi, Schroeter, Harding, Schwabe, De Vico -- a host of astronomers. 

It is stationary. 

In the English Mechanic, 49-195, Thomas Gwyn Elger publishes a sketch of it 
as he saw it upon the nights of April 18 and 20, 1889.(12) It occupied a 
position partly upon one ring and partly upon the other, showing no 
distortion. Let Prof. Keeler straddle two concentric merry-go-rounds, 
whirling at different velocities: there will be distortion. See vol. 49, 
English Mechanic, for observation after observation by astronomers upon this 
appearance, when seen for several months in the year 1889, the observers 
agreeing that, no matter what are the demands of theory, this fixed spot did 
indicate that the rings of Saturn do not move.(13) 

The White Spot on Saturn has blasted minor magic. He has little, black 
retainers who now function in the cause of completeness -- the little, black 
spots of Saturn -- 

Nature, 53-109:(14) 

That, in July and August, 1895, Prof. A. Mascari, of the Catania [50/51] 
Observatory, had seen dark spots upon the crepe ring of Saturn. The writer 
in Nature says that such duration is not easy to explain, if the rings of 
Saturn be formations of moving particles, because different parts of the 
discolored areas would have different velocities, so that soon would they 
distort and diffuse. 

Certainly enough, relatively to my purpose, which is find out for myself, 
and to find out with anybody else who may be equally impressed with a 
necessity, a brilliant, criminal thing has been slain by a gleam of higher 
intensity. Certainly enough, then, with the execution of one of its foremost 
exponents, the whole subject of spectroscopy in astronomy has been cast into 
rout and disgrace, of course only to ourselves, and not in view of 
manufacturers of spectroscopes, for instance; but a phantom thing dies a 
phantom death, and must be slain over and over again. 

I should say that just what is called the spectrum of a star is not commonly 
understood. It is one of the great uncertainties in science. The spectrum of 
a star is a ghost in the first place, but this ghost has to be further 
attenuated by a secondary process, and the whole appearance trembles so with 
the twinkling of a star that the stories told by spectra are gasps of 
palsied phantoms. So it is that, in one of the greatest indefinitenesses in 
science, an astronomer reads in a bewilderment that can be made to 
correspond with any desideratum. So it is our acceptance that when any 
faint, tremulous story told by a spectrum becomes standardized, the 
conventional astronomer is told, by the spectroscope, what he should be 
told, but that when anything new appears, for which there is no convention, 
the bewilderment of the astronomers is made apparent, and the worthlessness 
of spectroscopy in astronomy is shown to all except those who do not want to 
be shown. Upon the first of February, 1892, Dr. Thomas D. Anderson, of 
Edinburgh, discovered a new star that became known as Nova Aurigae.(15) Here 
was something as to which there was no dogmatic "determination." Each 
astronomer had to see, not what he should, but what he could. We shall see 
that the astronomers might as well have gone, for information, to some of 
Mrs. Piper's "controls" as to think of depending upon their own ghosts. 

In Monthly Notices, Feb., 1893, it is said that probably for seven weeks, up 
to the time of calculation, one part of this new [51/52] star had been 
receding at a rate of 230 miles a second, and another part approaching at a 
rate of 320 miles a second, giving to these components a distance apart of 
550 miles x 60 x 60 x 24 x 49, whatever that may be.(16) 

But there was another séance. This time Dr. Vogel was the medium. The ghosts 
told Dr. Vogel that the new star had three parts: one approaching this earth 
at a rate of about 420 miles a second, another approaching at a rate of 22 
miles a second, a third part receding at a rate of 300 miles a second. See 
Jour. B.A.A., 2-258.(17) 

After that, the controls became hysterical. They flickered that they were 
six parts of this new star, according to Dr. Lowells' Evolution of Worlds, 
p. 9.(18) The faithful will be sorry to read that Lowell revolted. He says: 
"There is not room for so many on the stage of the cosmic drama." For other 
reasons for repudiating spectroscopy, or spiritualism, in astronomy, read 
what else Lowell says upon this subject. 

Nova Aurigae became fainter. Accordingly, Prof. Klinkerfues "found" that two 
bodies had passed, and had inflamed each other, and that the light of their 
mutual disturbances would soon disappear (Jour. B.A.A., 2-365).(19) 

Nova Aurigae became brighter. Accordingly, Dr. Campbell "determined" that it 
was approaching this earth at a rate of 128 miles a second (Jour. B.A.A., 2-
504).(20) 

Then Dr. Espin went into a trance. It was revealed to him that the object 
was a nebula (Eng. Mec., 56-61).(21) Communication from Dr. and Mrs. 
Huggins, to the Royal Society -- not a nebula, but a star (Eng. Mec., 57-
397).(22) See Nature, 47-352, 425 -- that, according to M. Eugen Gothard the 
spectrum of N.A. agreed "perfectly" with the spectrum of a nebula: that, 
according to Dr. Huggins, no contrast could be more striking than the 
difference between the spectrum of N.A., and the spectrum of a nebula.(23) 

For an account of the revelations at Stonyhurst Observatory, see Mems. 
R.A.S., 51-129 -- that there never had been a composition of bodies moving 
at the rates that were so definitely announced, because N.A. was a single 
star.(24) [52/53] 

Though I have read some of the communications from "Rector" and "Dr. 
Phinuit" to Mrs. Piper, I cannot think that they ever mouthed sillier babble 
than was flickered by the star-ghosts to the astronomers in the year 1892. 
We noted Prof. Klinkerfues' "finding" that two stars had passed each other 
and that the illumination from their mutual perturbations would soon 
subside. There was no such disappearance. For observations upon N.A., ten 
years later, see Monthly Notices, 62-65.(25) For Prof. Barnard's 
observations twenty years later, see Sci. Amer. Sup., 76-154.(26) 

The spectroscope is useful in a laboratory. Spoons are useful in a kitchen. 
If any other pilgrim should come across a group of engineers trying to dig a 
canal with spoons, his experience and his temptation to linger would be like 
ours as to the astronomers and their attempted application of the 
spectroscope. I don't know what of remotest acceptability may survive in the 
third supposed proof that this earth moves around the sun, though we have 
not found it necessary to go into the technicalities of the supposed proof. 
I think we have killed the phantom thing, but I hope we have not quite 
succeeded, because we are moved more by the æsthetics of slaughter than by 
plain murderousness: we shall find unity in disposing of the third "proof" 
by the means by which the two others were disposed of -- 

Regular Annual Shift of Spectral Lines versus Solar Motion -- 

That, if this earth moves around the sun, the shift might be found by 
scientific Mrs. Pipers so to indicate -- 

But that if part of the time this earth, as a part of one traveling system, 
moves at a rate of 19 plus 13 miles a second and then part of the time at a 
rate of 19 minus 13 miles a second, compounding with great complexities at 
transverse times, that is the end of the regular annual shift that is 
supposed to apply to orbital motion.(27) 

We need not have admitted in the first place that the three abstrusities are 
resistances: however, we have a liking for revelations ourselves. Aberration 
and Parallax and Spectral Lines do not indicate that this earth moves 
relatively to the stars: quite as convincing they indicate that the stars in 
one composition gyrate relatively to a central and stationary earth, all of 
them [53/54] in one concavity around this earth, some of them showing 
faintest of parallax, if this earth be not quite central to the revolving 
whole. 

Something that I did not mention before, though I referred to Lowell's 
statements, is that astronomers now admit, or state, that the shift of 
spectral lines, which they say indicates that this earth moves around the 
sun, also indicates any one of three other circumstances, or sets of 
circumstances. Some persons will ask why I didn't say so at first and quit 
the meaningless subject. May be it was a weakness of mine -- something of a 
sporting instinct, I fear me, I have at times. I lingered, perhaps slightly 
intoxicated, with the deliciousness of Prof. Keeler and his decimals -- like 
someone at a race track, determining that a horse is running at a rate of 
2653 feet and 4 inches a minute, by a method that means no more than it 
means that the horse is brown, is making clattering sounds, or has a 
refreshing odor. For a study of a state of mind like that of many clergymen 
who try to believe in Moses, and in Darwin, too, see the works of Prof. 
Young, for instance.(28) This astronomer teaches the conventional 
spectroscopic doctrine, and also mentions the other circumstances that make 
the doctrine meaningless. Such inconsistencies are phenomena of all 
transitions from the old to the new. 

Three giants have appeared against us. Their hearts are bubbles. Their bones 
wilt. They are weak Karyatides that uphold the phantom structure of Paleo-
astronomy. By what miracle, we asked, could foundation be built subsequently 
under a baseless thing. But three ghosts can fit in anywhere. 

Sometimes astronomers cite the Foucault pendulum-experiment as "proof" of 
the motions of this earth. The circumstances of this demonstration are not 
easily made clear: consequently one of normal suspiciousness is likely to 
let it impose upon him. But my practical and commonplace treatment is to 
disregard what the experiment and its complexities are, and to enquire 
whether it works out or not. It does not. See Amer. Jour. Sci., 2-12-402; 
Eng. Mec., 93-293, 306; Astro. Reg., 2-265.(29) Also we are told that 
experiments upon falling bodies have proved this earth's rotation. I get so 
tired of demonstrating that there never has [54/55] been any Evolution 
mentally, except as to ourselves, that, if I could, I'd be glad to say that 
these experiments work out beautifully. Maybe they do. See Proctor's Old and 
New Astronomy, p. 229.(30) [55]

1. Bradley's measurements of Draconis (Gamma Draconis) began in December of 
1725 and continued to the following December. As the seventy observations of 
this star did not differ from that expected by his hypothesis by more than 
2", (except once by 3"), Bradley believed that the parallax, which he had 
originally been seeking, amounted to less than this amount. "A letter from 
the Reverend Mr. James Bradley...." Philosphical Transactions of the Royal 
Society of London, 35 (no. 406; December 1728): 637-61. Harlow Shapley, and

2. In 1783, Wilhelm Herschel, (without any knowledge of the parallaxes of 
the stars, which he had failed to detect), decided that the solar system was 
travelling in the direction of the constellation Hercules. Macpherson 
states: "Modern astronomers, with more perfect data on which to work, have 
found that our Sun is moving towards the neighbouring constellation Lyra, 
carrying with it all the planets and comets, at the velocity of eleven miles 
per second." Hector Macpherson, Jr. Through the Depths of Space. London: 
William Blackwood and Sons, 1908, 90. Moulton indicates several changes in 
the "solar apex," (or the apparent direction in which the solar system is 
moving relative to the other stars): according to Lewis Boss, the apex is at 
R.A. 270.5 and declination +34.3; H.C. Wilson found the declination to be 
+27; F.W. Dyson and W.G. Thackeray found declinations ranging from +16 
according to bright stars up to +43 according to stars with magnitudes of 8 
and 9. Also, the declination of solar motion varies according to different 
spectral classes of stars; but, Moulton accepts the latest (1928) results by 
W.W. Campbell and J.H. Moore: "Evidently the motion of the sun with respect 
to the local star-cloud is approximately in the direction defined by right 
ascension 270 and declination +30, and its speed with respect to these stars 
is about 20 kilometers per second." While the solar system is thus said to 
be moving away from other stars in two different directions at the same 
time, only the circle, ellipses, and flat lines of the ideal "aberration" 
forms are usually shown in the astronomical texts. Moulton does admit to "a 
small aberration due to the earth's rotation, which, for a point on the 
earth equator, amounts at its maximum of 0.31"." Yet, he takes no notice of 
the relative motion of the earth within a moving solar system, as Fort does.

7. Chambers also ignores the motion of the solar system: "We have hitherto 
considered aberration as a matter affecting the stars, but it affects also 
planets and comets. As, however, those bodies are themselves in motion, a 
complication is imported into the matter when aberration has to be worked 
out in nice detail for any astronomical purpose requiring strict accuracy."

3. Fort is correct in accounting for the distance over which the solar 
system would move each year is more than four times its orbital parallax; 
but, in terms of the effect upon the measure of parallax, this is an 
exaggerated simplification. For the nearest bright star, Sirius, the change 
in the parallax, as envisioned by Fort would amount to less than half a 
degree of change in its celestial position over a 2,000 year period; 
however, what should be considered is the proper motion of the star, as the 
stars may also move in different directions and at different rates of speed 
relative to the motions of our solar system. Even so, the proper motion of 
Sirius would still only produce a change in position that is less than a 
degree, over a 2,000 year period, which was noticed by Halley when he 
compared his measures of star positions with those of Hipparchus and 
Ptolemy; and, the motions of other constellation stars, which are at far 
greater distances, would scarcely be perceptible. Edmond Halley.

CHAPTER EIGHT





IT is supposed that astronomic subjects and principles and methods can not 
be understood by the layman. I think this, myself. We shall take up some of 
the principles of astronomy, with the idea of expressing that of course they 
cannot be understood by the unhypnotized any more than the stories of Noah's 
Ark and Jonah and the Whale be understood, but that our understanding, if we 
have any, will have some material for its exercises, just the same. The 
velocity of light is one of these principles. A great deal in the astronomic 
system depends on the supposed velocity: determinations of distance, and the 
amount of aberration depend. It will be our expression that these are ratios 
of impositions to mummeries, with such clownish products that formulas turn 
into antics, and we shall have scruples against taking up the subject at 
all, because we have much hard work to do, and we have qualms against 
stopping so often to amuse ourselves. But, then, sometimes in a more 
sentimental mood, I think that the pretty story of the velocity of light, 
and its "determination," will some day be of legitimate service; be rhymed 
some day, and told to children, in future kindergartens, replacing the story 
of Little Bo-peep, with the tale of a planet that lost its satellites and 
sometimes didn't know where to find them, but that good magicians came along 
and formulated the indeterminable. 

It was found by Roemer, a seventeenth-century astronomer, that, at times, 
the moons of Jupiter did not disappear behind him, and did not emerge from 
behind him, when they "should." He found that as distance between this earth 
and Jupiter increased, the delays increased. He concluded that these delays 
represented times consumed by the light of the moons in traveling greater 
distances. He found, or supposed he found, that when this earth is farthest 
from Jupiter, light from a satellite is seen 22 minutes later than [56/57] 
when nearest Jupiter. Given measurement of the distance between opposite 
points in the earth's supposed orbit, and times consumed in traveling this 
distance -- there you have the velocity of light.(1) 

I still say that it is a pretty story and should be rhymed; but we shall 
find that astronomers might as well try to formulate the gambols of the 
sheep of Little Bo-peep, as to try to formulate anything depending upon the 
satellites of Jupiter. 

In the Annals of Philosophy, 23-29, Col. Beaufoy write that, upon Dec. 7, 
1823, he looked for the emergence of Jupiter's third satellite, at the time 
set down in the National Almanac: for two hours he looked, and did not see 
the satellite emerge.(2) In Monthly Notices, 44-8, an astronomer writes 
that, upon the night of Oct. 15, 1883, one of the satellites of Jupiter was 
forty-six minutes late.(3) A paper was read at the meeting of the British 
Astronomical Association, Feb. 8, 1907, upon a satellite that was twenty 
minutes late. In Telescopic Work, p. 191, W.F. Denning writes that, upon the 
night of Sept. 12, 1889, he and two other astronomers could not see 
satellite IV at all.(4) See the Observatory, 9-237 -- satellite IV 
disappeared 15 minutes before calculated time; about a minute later it re-
appeared; disappeared again; reappeared nine minutes later.(5) For Todd's 
observations, see the Observatory, 2-227 -- six times, between June 9 and 
July 2, 1878, a satellite was visible when, according to prediction, it 
should have been invisible.(6) For some more instances of extreme vagaries 
of these satellites, see Monthly Notices, 43-427, and Jour. B.A.A., 14-27: 
observations by Noble, Turner, White, Holmes, Freeman, Goodacre, Ellis, and 
Molesworth.(7) In periodical astronomical publications, there is no more 
easily findable material for heresy than such observations. We shall have 
other instances. They abound in English Mechanic, for instance. But, in 
spite of a host of such observations, Prof. Young (The Sun, p. 35) says that 
the time occupied by light coming from these satellites is doubtful by "only 
a fraction of a second."(8) It is of course another instance of the 
astronomers who know very little of astronomy. 

It would be undignified, if the astronomers had taken the sheep of Little 
Bo-peep for their determinations. They took [57/58] the satellites of 
Jupiter. They said that the velocity of light is about 190,000 miles a 
second. 

So did the physicists. 

Our own notion is that there is no velocity of light: that one sees a thing, 
or doesn't; that if the satellites of Jupiter behave differently according 
to proximity to this earth, that may be because this earth affects them, so 
affecting them, because the planets may not, as we may find, be at a 
thousandth part of the "demonstrated" distances. The notion of velocity of 
light finds support, we are told in the text books, in the velocity of 
sound. If it does, it doesn't find support in gravitational effects, 
because, according to the same text books, gravitational effects have no 
velocity. 

The physicists agreed with the astronomers. A beam of light is sent through, 
and is reflected back through, a revolving shutter -- but it's complex, and 
we're simple: we shall find that there is no need to go into the details of 
this mechanism. It is not that a machine is supposed to register a velocity 
of 186,000 miles a second, or we'd have to be technical: it is that the eye 
is supposed to perceive -- 

And there is not a physicist in the world who can perceive when a parlor 
magician palms off playing-cards. Hearing, or feeling, or if one could smell 
light, some kind of a claim might be made -- but the well-known limitations 
of seeing; common knowledge of little boys that a brand waved about in the 
dark cannot be followed by the eyes. The limit of the perceptible is said to 
be ten changes a second. 

I think of the astronomers as occupying a little vortex of their own in the 
cosmic swoon in which wave all things, at least in this one supposed solar 
system. Call it swoon, or call it hypnosis -- but that it is never absolute, 
and that all of us sometimes have awareness of our condition, and moments of 
wondering what it's all about and why we do and think the things that 
sometimes we wake up and find ourselves doing and thinking. Upon page 281, 
Old and New Astronomy, Richard Proctor wakens momentarily, and says: "The 
agreement between these results seems close enough, but those who know the 
actual difficulty of precise time-observations of the phenomena of Jupiter's 
satellites, to say [58/59] nothing of the present condition of the theory of 
their motions, can place very little reliance on the velocity of light 
deduced from such observations."(9) Upon pages 603-607, Proctor reviews some 
observations other than those that I have listed -- satellites that have 
disappeared, come back, disappeared, returned again so bewilderingly that he 
wrote what we have quoted -- observations by Gorton, Wray, Gambart, Secchi, 
Main, Grover, Smyth-Maclean-Pearson, Hodgson, Carlisle, Siminton.(10) And 
that is the last of his awareness: Proctor then swoons back into his 
hypnosis. He then takes up the determination of the velocity of light by the 
physicists, as if they can be relied upon, accepting every word, writing his 
gospel, glorying in this miracle of science.(11) I call it a tainted 
agreement between the physicists and astronomers. I prefer mild language. If 
by a method by which nothing can be found out, the astronomers determined 
that the velocity of light is about 190,000 miles a second, and if the 
physicists by another method found about the same result, what kind of 
harmony can that be other than the reekings of two consistent stenches? 
Proctor wrote that very little reliance could be placed upon anything 
depending upon Jupiter's satellites. It never occurred to him to wonder by 
what miracle the physicists agreed with these unreliable calculations. It is 
the situation that repeats in the annals of astronomy -- a baseless thing 
that is supposed to have a foundation slipped under it, wedged in, or God 
knows how introduced or foisted. I prefer not to bother much with asking how 
the physicists could determine anything of a higher number of changes than 
ten per second. If it be accepted that the physicists are right, the 
question is -- by what miracle were the astronomers right, if they had "very 
little" to rely upon? 

Determinations of planetary distances and determinations of the velocity of 
light have squirmed together: they represent either an agreeable picture of 
co-operation, or a study in mutual support by writhing infamies. With most 
emphasis I have taken the position that the vagaries of the Jovian 
satellites are so great that extremely little reliance can be placed upon 
them, but now it seems to me that the emphasis should be upon the admission 
that, in addition to these factors of indeterminateness, it was, [59/60] up 
to Proctor's day, not known how anything like accuracy when the satellites 
should appear and disappear. In that case one wonders as to the state of the 
theory in Roemer's day. It was in the mind of Roemer that the two 
"determinations" we are now considering first most notably satisfied 
affinity: mutual support by velocity of light and distances in this supposed 
solar system. Upon his Third Law, which, as we shall see later, he 
constructed upon at least three absences of anything to build upon, Kepler 
had, upon observations of Mars, deduced 13,000,000 miles as this earth's 
distance from the sun.(12) By the same method, which is the now discredited 
method of simultaneous observations, Roemer determined this distance to be 
82,000,000 miles.(13) I am not concerned with this great discrepancy so much 
as with the astronomers' reasons for starting off distances in millions 
instead of hundreds or thousands of miles.(14) 

In Kepler's day the strongest objection urged against the Copernican system 
was that, if this earth moves around the sun, the stars should show annual 
displacements -- and it is only under modern "refinements" that the stars do 
so minutely vary, perhaps. The answer to this objection was that the stars 
are vastly farther away than was commonly supposed. Entailed by this answer 
was the necessity of enlarging upon common suppositions generally. Kepler 
determined or guessed, just as one pleases, and then Roemer outdid him. 
Roemer was followed by Huygens, with continued outdoing: 100,000,000 
according to Huygens. Huygens took for his basis his belief that this earth 
is intermediate in size to Mars and Venus.(15) Astronomers, to-day, say that 
this earth is not so intermediate. We see that, in the secondary phase of 
development, the early astronomers, with no means of knowing whether the sun 
is a thousand or a million miles away, guessed or determined such distances 
as 82,000,000 miles and 100,000,000 miles, to account for the changelessness 
of the stars. If the mean of the extremes is about the distance of present 
dogmas, we'd like to know by what miracle a true distance so averages two 
products of wild methods. Our expression is that these developments had 
their origin in conspiracy and prostitution, if one has a fancy for such 
accusations; or, if everybody else has been so agreeable, we think more 
amiably, ourselves, that [60/61] it was all a matter of comfortably 
adjusting and being obliging all around. Our expression is that ever since 
the astronomers have seen and have calculated as they should see and should 
calculate. For instance, when this earth's distance from the sun was 
supposed to be 95,000,000 miles, all astronomers taking positions of Mars 
calculated a distance of 95,000,000 miles; but then, when the distance was 
cut down to about 92,000,000 miles, all astronomers, taking positions of 
Mars, calculated about a distance of 92,000,000 miles. It may sound like a 
cynicism of mine, but in saying this I am quoting Richard Proctor, in one of 
his lucid suspicions (Old and New Astronomy, p. 280).(16) 

With nothing but monotony, and with nothing that looks like relief for us, 
the data of conspiracy, or of co-operation, continue. Upon worthless 
observations upon the transits of Venus, 1761 and 1769, this earth's orbit 
was found by Encke to be about 190,000,000 miles across (distance of the sun 
about 95,000,000 miles). Altogether progress had been made toward the wild 
calculations of Huygens than toward the undomesticated calculations of 
Roemer. So, to agree with this change, if not progress, Delambre, taking 
worthless observations upon the satellites of Jupiter, cut down Roemer's 
worthless determinations, and announced that light crosses the plane of this 
earth's orbit in 16 minutes and 32 seconds -- as it ought to, Prof. Young 
would say.(17) It was then that the agreeably tainted physicists started 
spinning and squinting, calculating "independently," we are told, that 
Delambre was right. Everything settled -- everybody comfortable -- see 
Chambers' Handbook of Astronomy, published at this time -- that the sun's 
distance had been ascertained, "with great accuracy," to be 95,298,260 miles 
--(18) 

But then occurred something that is badly, but protectively, explained, in 
most astronomical works. Foucault interfered with the deliciousness of those 
95,298,260 miles. One may read many books that mention this subject, and one 
will always read that Foucault, the physicist, by an "independent" method, 
or by an "absolutely independent" method, disagreed somewhat. The 
"disagreement" is paraded so that one has the impression of painstaking, 
independent scientists not utterly slavishly supporting one another, but at 
the same time keeping well over the 90,000,000 [61/62] mark, and so 
essentially agreeing, after all. But we find that there was no independence 
in Foucault's "experiments." We come across the same old disgusting 
connivance, or the same amiable complaisance, perhaps. See Clerke's History 
of Astronomy, p. 230.(19) We learn that astronomers, to explain oscillations 
of the sun, had decided that the sun must be, not 95,298,260 miles away, but 
about 91,000,000.(20) To oblige them, perhaps, or innocently, never having 
heard of them, perhaps, though for ten years they had been announcing that a 
new determination was needed, Foucault "found" that the velocity of light is 
less than had been necessary to suppose, when the sun was supposed to be 
about 95,000,000 miles away, and he "found" the velocity to be exactly what 
it should be, supposing the sun to be 91,000,000 miles away. Then it was 
that the astronomers announced, not that they had cut down the distance of 
the sun because of observations upon solar oscillations, but because they 
had been very much impressed by the "independent" observations upon the 
velocity of light, by Foucault, the physicist.(21) This squirm occurred at 
the meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society, February, 1864. There would 
have to be more squirms. If, then, the distance across this earth's orbit 
was "found" to be less than Delambre had supposed, somebody would have to 
find that light comes from the satellites of Jupiter a little slower than 
Delambre had "proved." Whereupon Glasenapp "found" that the time is 16 
minutes and 40 seconds, which is what he should, or "ought to," find.(22) 
Whereupon, there would have to be re-adjustment of Encke's calculations of 
distance of sun, upon worthless observations upon transits of Venus. And 
whereupon again, Newcomb went over the very same observations by which Encke 
had compelled agreement with the dogmas of his day, and Newcomb calculated, 
as was required, that the distance agreed with Foucault's reduction. 
Whether, in the first place, Encke ever did calculate, as he said he did, or 
not, his determination was mere agreement with Laplace's in the seventh book 
of Méchanique Céleste.(23) Of course he said that he had calculated 
independently, because his method was by triangulation, and Laplace's was 
the gravitational.(24) [62/63] 

That the word "worthless" does apply to observations upon transits of Venus: 

In Old and New Astronomy, Proctor says that the observations upon the 
transits of 1761 and 1769 were "altogether unsatisfactory."(25) One supposes 
that anything that is altogether unsatisfactory can't be worth much. In the 
next transit, of 1874, various nations co-operated. The observations were so 
disappointing that the Russian, Italian, and Austrian governments refused to 
participate in the expeditions of 1882. In Reminiscences of an Astronomer, 
p. 181, Newcomb says that the United States Commission, of which he was 
Secretary, had, up to 1902 never published its observations, and probably 
never would, because by that time all other members were either dead or upon 
the retired list.(26) 

Method of Mars -- more monotony -- because of criticisms of the taking of 
parallax by simultaneous observations, Dr. David Gill went to the Island of 
Ascension, during the opposition of Mars of 1877, to determine alone, by the 
diurnal method, the distance of this earth from the sun, from positions of 
Mars. For particulars of Gill's method, see, for instance, Poor's Solar 
System, p. 86.(27) Here Prof. Poor says that, of course, the orbital motion 
of Mars had to be allowed for, in Gill's calculations. If so, then of course 
this earth's orbital motion had to be allowed for. If Dr. Gill knew the 
space traversed by this earth in its orbit, and the curvature of its path, 
he knew the size and shape of the orbit, and consequently the distance from 
the sun. Then he took for the basis of his allowance that this earth is 
about 93,000,000 miles from the sun, and calculated that this earth is about 
93,000,000 miles from the sun. For this classic deduction from the known to 
the same known, he received a gold medal. 

In our earlier surveys, we were concerned with the false claim that there 
can be application of celestial mechanics to celestial phenomena; but, as to 
later subjects, the method is different. The method of all these 
calculations is triangulation. 

One simple question: 

To what degree can triangulation be relied upon? [63/64] 

To great degree in measuring the height of a building, or in little 
distances of a surveyor's problems. It is clear enough that astronomers did 
not invent the telescope. They adopted the spectroscope from another 
science. Their primary mathematical principle of triangulation they have 
taken from the surveyors, to whom it is serviceable. The triangle is another 
emblem of the sterility of the science of astronomy. Upon the coat of arms 
of this great mule of the sciences, I would draw a prism within a triangle.

1. Olaus Römer's experiment, based upon observations of the eclipses of the 
first satellite of Jupiter, was to determine whether light was 
instantaneously transmitted to a distance or required a period of time to be 
transmitted over a distance, owing to a finite velocity. His findings were 
that, over the distance traversed by the earth (in its own orbit) during one 
revolution of Jupiter's first satellite, "no perceptible difference" was 
observed, but, that, over the distance traversed by the earth during forty 
revolutions, there was a measurable difference: "...this amounted to 22 
minutes for the entire distance HE, which is double that from here to the 
Sun." Römer claimed light had a finite velocity: the velocity of light was 
greater than the earth's diameter in one second, and it took eleven minutes 
for light to travel the distance from the Sun to the Earth. Thus, the 
velocity of light was only vaguely determined as in excess of 3,000 leagues 
per second, but its upper measure depended upon the measure of the solar 
parallax. Harlow Shapley, and, Helen E. Howarth. A Source Book in Astronomy. 
New York: McGraw-Hill Book Co., 1929, 70-1. This period of eleven minutes 
was later diminished. Duncan gives the measurement of light, by Römer, as 
taking "600 seconds to travel the distance from the Sun to the Earth, a 
figure that has been changed by subsequent investigations to 499 seconds."

accurate is this law, that in the thousands of revolutions of the satellites 
which have taken place since they were discovered, not the smallest 
deviation from it (except what depends upon the elliptic form of the orbit 
of the third satellite) has ever been discovered." George Biddell Airy.

the satellite projected onto Jupiter for twenty seconds. Gambart stated that 
the first satellite disappeared and reappeared several times before a 
transit on October 19, 1823. Secchi and Main had several times observed 
Jupiter's edge to "alternately approach and recede from a satellite several 
times during five minutes." Grover once observed the second satellite stop 
for a full minute in its path before an occultation. William Henry Smyth at 
Bedford, Thomas Maclear at Biggleswade, and Pearson at South Kilworth had 
separately observed the second satellite approach or disappear past the edge 
of Jupiter, reappear for four minutes, then again disappear, on June 26, 
1828. Hodgson observed the first satellite projected onto Jupiter's limb for 
nearly a minute. Carlisle observed the second satellite for about three-
quarters of a minute after last contact (past the limb) in occultation. And, 
T.D. Siminton observed the fourth satellite emerge from Jupiter's shadow 
after glimpses for a minute or two and then again disappear, in March of 
1883.

13. The combined effort by Richer, in Cayenne, and by Cassini, Picard, and 
Römer, in France, did not provide a solar parallax, as "the instrumental 
means of the observers were insufficient." Cassini determined that, if the 
solar parallax of Mars were 25", (which would have been detected by their 
instruments), then the earth's solar parallax would have been 10"; and, 
Cassini thought that the measure was not more than 9.5". Flamsted, from one 
observing station, obtained a measure of 10"; and, Lacaille, at the Cape of 
Good Hope, with several Astronomers in Europe, also obtained a solar 
parallax of 10", (which would give a distance of about 81,700,000 miles).

Planetary System. London: Longmans, Green and Co., 1872, 24-5. 

14. Aristarchus had attempted to measure when the moon was half-illumined 
and obtained a solar parallax of three degrees, which would have meant a 
distance of nineteen to twenty times that of the moon; and another method 
described by Ptolemy, based upon the shadows of the earth during partial 
lunar eclipses, produced a solar parallax of 3' 11", which would be a 
distance of 1210 radii of the earth. Simon Newcomb. Popular Astronomy. 2nd 
ed. London: Macmillan and Co., 1883, 171-2. Copernicus recalculated 
Ptolemy's method with different data and obtained a measure of 1142 radii of 
the earth; but, according to his own theory, Copernicus determined the 
distance between the earth and sun to vary between 1105 and 1179 radii of 
the earth, (which is about 200 times less than the modern measures). Angus

17. According to Delambre, in 1819, the time spent in light travelling 
across the distance of the sun to the earth was 493.2 seconds; and according 
to Glasenapp, in 1874, the estimated time was 500.84 seconds. On this 
"light-equation," Clerke states: "...this, from the extreme care employed, 
can hardly, at the outside, be more than a couple of seconds astray." Agnes 
Mary Clerke. A Popular History of Astronomy. New York: Macmillan & Co., 
1886, 274. Todd explains the difficulty in reconciling these two measures: 
"It is quite impossible to judge with certainty just how these two widely 
discordant values should be combined." However, this does not prevent Todd 
from providing a new value: "I combine the two values giving weight unity to 
the first, and weight two the second. The adopted value k is, therefore, 
498s.3, which combined with the constant of light-velocity just deduced 
gives the mean radius of the orbit of the earth equal to 149,450,000 
kilometers = 92,866,000 miles." David Peck Todd. "Solar parallax from the 
velocity of light." American Journal of Science, s. 3, 19 (no. 109; January 
1880): 59-64, at 62. As Römer only "inferred" a measurement of "about 600 
seconds," Moulton states: "Later observations showed that the actual time-
interval for the mean distance from the sun to the earth is 498.58 seconds."

enormous estimate of the Earth's mean diameter on which the table is based. 
Oddly enough, Mr. Chambers has combined the correct estimate for the 
parallax at present adopted, with Ferguson's incorrect values. It would 
almost appear as though the figures had been simply quoted without being 
tested in any way, were not such an idea incredible." Richard Anthony

21. With the announcement of Encke's measure, the velocity of light was 
determined by astronomers to be "no less than 192,000 miles in a single 
second." Fizeau measured the velocity as 194,600 miles per second, which was 
in accord with Encke's parallax; but, Foucault measured the velocity as 
"only 185,300 miles per second," (which was in accord with Winnecke's and 
Newcomb's amended measures of the solar parallax, determined by observations 
of Mars). "By the year 1864 it had become abundantly clear that the accepted 
estimate of the Sun's distance was too great." Richard Anthony Proctor. The

25. Richard Anthony Proctor. Old and New Astronomy. Longmans, Green, and 
Co., 1892, 275. Proctor also reviews the results of the transits of 1761 and 
1769 by different observers, which were later modified by Encke into the 
long-standing value of a parallax of 8".5776 or a distance of 95,274,000 
miles. The original results of the solar parallax varied greatly: in 1761, 
Planmann obtained 8".2; Rumkowski obtained 8".35; Short obtained a value 
between 8".47 and 8".52; Audefredy obtained 9".2; Pingré obtained 10"; and, 
in 1769, William Smith obtained 7".5; Hornby obtained 8".78; Lalande 
obtained 8".8; Lexell obtained between 8".65 and 8".86, adopting 8".8 as his 
result; and, Pingré obtained three results, 8".43, 8.88", and 9".2. The 
varied results in 1769, ranging from 7".5 to 9".2, correspond to distances 
from 87,890,780 to 108,984,560 miles; yet, Encke's value of 8".5776 was 
deemed to be correct with no more than one percent error. Proctor wrote: "It 
is somewhat surprising, considering the evidence which was afforded by the 
discrepancies between the observations made in 1761 and 1769, that this 
result should have been regarded with such confidence, since it needed but a 
brief examination of the basis on which Encke's result was founded to see 
that no faith whatever could be placed in three at least out of the five 
numerals in the expression 8".5776. Delambre regarded 8".6, very justly, as 
the most probable value of the solar parallax half a century ago." And 
Laplace is quoted, regarding Encke's result: "It is remarkable that an 
astronomer, without leaving his observatory, by merely comparing his 
observations with analysis, has thus been enabled to determine the distance 
of the Earth from the Sun -- an element the knowledge of which has been the 
fruit of long and troublesome voyages in both hemispheres." Richard Anthony

London: Longmans, Green, and Co., 1872, 2d ed.; 46-8, 50. Newcomb dismisses 
Encke's measure as an error, "received without question for more than thirty 
years," until Hansen discovered a conflicting measure from his observations 
of the lunar parallactic inequality. Simon Newcomb. Popular Astronomy. 2nd

CHAPTER NINE





ACCORDING to Prof. Newcomb, for instance, the distance of the sun is about 
380 times the distance of the moon -- as determined by triangulation.(1) But 
upon page 22, Popular Astronomy, Newcomb tells of another demonstration, 
with strikingly different results -- as determined by triangulation.(2) 

A split god. 

The god Triangulation is not one undivided deity. 

The other method with strikingly different results is the method of 
Aristarchus. It cuts down the distance of the sun, from 380 to 20 times the 
distance of the moon. When an observer upon this earth sees the moon half-
illuminated, the angle at the moon, between observer and sun, is a right 
angle; a third line between observer and sun completes a triangle. According 
to Aristarchus, the tilt of the third line includes an angle of 86 degrees, 
making the sun-earth line 20 times longer than the moon-earth line. 

"In principle," says Newcomb, "the method is quite correct, and very 
ingenious, but it can not be applied in practice." He says that Aristarchus 
measured wrong; that the angle between the moon-earth line and the earth-sun 
line is almost 90 degrees and not 86 degrees. Then he says that the method 
can not be applied because no one can determine this angle that he said is 
of almost 90 degrees. He says a something that is so incongruous with the 
inflations of astronomers that they'd sizzle if their hypnotized readers 
could read and think at the same time. Newcomb says that the method of 
Aristarchus can not be applied because no astronomer can determine when the 
moon is half-illumined.(3) 

We have had some experience. 

Does anybody who has been through what we've been through suppose that there 
is a Prof. Keeler in the world who would not [65/66] declare that 
trigonometrically and spectroscopically and micrometrically he had 
determined the exact moment and exasperating, or delightful, decimal of a 
moment of semi-illumination of the moon, were it not that, according to at 
least as good a mathematician as he, determination based upon that 
demonstration does show that the sun is only 20 times as far away as the 
moon?(4) But suppose we agree that this simple thing can not be done. 

Then instantly we think of some of the extravagant claims with which 
astronomers have stuffed supine credulities. Crawling in their unsightly 
confusion that sickens for simplification, is this offense to harmony: 

That astronomers can tell under which Crusade, or its decimalated moment, a 
shine left a star, but cannot tell when a shine reaches a line on the moon -
- 

Glory and triumph and selectness and inflation -- or that we shall have 
renown as evangelists, spreading the homely and wholesome doctrine of 
humility. Hollis, in Chats on Astronomy, tells us that the diameter of this 
earth, at the equator, is 41,851,160 feet.(5) But blessed be the meek, we 
tell him. In the Observatory, 19-118, is published the determination, by the 
astronomer Brenner, of the time of rotation of Venus, as to which other 
astronomers differ by hundreds of days.(6) According to Brenner, the time is 
23 hours, 57 minutes, and 7.5459 seconds. I do note that this especial 
refinement is a little too ethereal for the Editor of the Observatory: he 
hopes Brenner will pardon him, but is it necessary to carry out the finding 
to the fourth decimal place of a second? However, I do not mean to say that 
all astronomers are as refined as Brenner, for instance. In the Jour. 
B.A.A., 1-382, Edwin Holmes, perhaps coarsely, expresses some views.(7) He 
says that such "exactness" as Captain Noble's in writing that the diameter 
of Neptune is 38,133 miles and that of Uranus is 33,836 miles is bringing 
science into contempt, because very little is known of these planets; that 
according to Neison, these diameters are 27,000 miles and 28,500 miles. 
Macpherson, in A Century's Progress in Science, quotes Prof. Serviss: that 
the average parallax of a star, which is an ordinary astronomic quantity, is 
"about equal to the apparent distance between two pins, place one inch 
apart, and viewed from a distance of one hundred and [66/67] eighty 
miles."(8) Stick pins in a cushion, in New York -- go to Saratoga and look 
at them -- be overwhelmed with the more than human powers of the 
scientifically anointed -- or ask them when shines half the moon. 

The moon's surface is irregular. I do not say that anybody with brains 
enough to know when he had half a shoe polished should know when the sun had 
half the moon shined.(9) I do say that if this simple thing can not be 
known, the crowings of astronomers as to enormously more difficult 
determination are mere barnyard disturbances. 

Triangulation that, according to his little priests, straddles orbits and on 
his apex wears a star -- that he's a false Colossus; shrinking, at the touch 
of data, back from the stars, deflating below the sun and moon; stubbing 
down below the clouds of this earth, so that the different stories that he 
told to Aristarchus and to Newcomb are the conflicting vainglories of an 
earth-tied squatter -- 

The blow that crumples a god: 

That, by triangulation, there is not an astronomer in the world who can tell 
the distance of a thing only five miles away. 

Humboldt, Cosmos, 5-138:(10) 

Height of Mauna Loa: 18,410 feet, according to Cook; 16,611, according to 
Marchand; 13,761, according to Wilkes -- according to triangulation. 

In the Scientific American, 119-31, a mountain climber calls the Editor to 
account for having written that Mt. Everest is 29,002 feet high.(11) He says 
that, in his experience, there is always an error of at least ten per cent, 
in calculating the height of a mountain, so that all that can be said is 
that Mt. Everest is between 26,100 and 31,900 feet high. In the Scientific 
American, 102-183, and 319, Miss Annie Peck cites two measurements of a 
mountain in India: they differ by 4000 feet.(12) 

The most effective way of treating this subject is to find a list of 
measurements of a mountain's height before the mountain was climbed, and 
compare with the barometric determination, when the mountain was climbed. 
For a list of 8 measurements, by triangulation, of the height of Mt. St. 
Elias, see the Alpine Journal, 22-150: they vary from 12,672 to 19,500 
feet.(13) D'Abruzzi [67/68] climbed Mt. St. Elias, Aug. 1, 1897. See a paper 
in the Alpine Journal, 19-125.(14) D'Abruzzi barometric determination -- 
18,092 feet. 

Suppose that, in measuring, by triangulation, the distance of anything five 
miles away, the error is, say, ten per cent. But, as to anything ten miles 
away, there is no knowing what the error would be. By triangulation, the 
moon has been "found" to be 240,000 miles away. It may be 240 miles or 
240,000,000 miles away.(15) [68]

to Brenner's determination of a rapid rotational period of Venus in 1895 by 
means of observations of its surface markings, V. Cerulli had determined in 
the same year a rotation period of 224.7 days from the linear markings he 
observed on Venus, (similar to those observed on Mars by Schiaparelli and 
Lowell), in the same year. V. Cerulli. "Le ombre di Venere." Astronomische

period of 23 hours and 21 minutes, based upon a bright spot and several 
dusky spots that he had traced upon the planet in April of 1667. In 1726 and 
1727, Bianchini was able to draw a map of the three oceans and two spots on 
Venus; but, as stated by Webb, he "gave a wrong rotation of 24d 8h." 
Watching the cusps, Schröter also obtained a rotation period of 23 hours 21 
minutes, between 1788 and 1793; and, in 1842, De Vico refined this measure 
to 23 hours 21 minutes 22 seconds, after rediscovering and observing a

CHAPTER TEN





PSEUDO heart of a phantom thing -- it is Keplerism, pulsating with Sir Isaac 
Newton's regularizations. 

If triangulation can not be depended upon accurately to measure distance 
greater than a mile or two between objects and observers, the aspects of 
Keplerism that depend upon triangulation should be of no more concern to us 
than two pins in a cushion 180 miles away: nevertheless so affected by 
something like seasickness are we by the wobbling deductions of the 
conventionalists that we shall have direct treatment, or independent 
expressions, whenever we can have, or seem to have, them. Kepler saw a 
planetary system, and he felt that, if that system could be formulated in 
terms of proportionality, by discovering one of the relations 
quantitatively, all of its measurements could be deduced. I take from 
Newcomb, in Popular Astronomy, that, in Kepler's view, there was a system in 
the arrangement and motions of the four little traitors that sneak around 
Jupiter; that Kepler, with no suspicions of these little betrayers, reasoned 
that this central body and its accompaniments were a representation, upon a 
small scale, of the solar system, as a whole.(1) Kepler found that the cubes 
of mean distances of neighboring satellites of Jupiter, divided by the 
squares of their times, gave the same quotients. He reasoned that the same 
relations subsisted among planets, if the solar system be only an 
enlargement of the Jovian system. 

Observatory, December, 1920: "The discordances between theory and 
observation (as to the motions of Jupiter's satellites) are of such 
magnitude that continued observations of the precise moments of eclipses are 
very much to be desired."(2) In the Report of the Jupiter Section of the 
British Astronomical Society, (Mems. B.A.A., 8-83), is a comparison between 
observed times and calculated times of these satellites.(3) 65 observations, 
in the [69/70] year 1899, are listed. In one instance prediction and 
observation agree. Many differences of 3 or 4 minutes are noted, and there 
are differences of 5 or 6 minutes.(4) 

Kepler formulated his law of proportionality between times and distances of 
Jupiter's satellites without knowing what the times are. It should be noted 
that the observations in the year 1899 took into consideration fluctuations 
that were discovered by Roemer, long after Kepler's time. 

Just for the sake of having something that looks like opposition, let us try 
to think that Kepler was miraculously right anyway. Then, if something that 
may resemble Kepler's Third Law does subsist in the Jovian satellites that 
were known to Kepler, by what resemblance to logicality can that 
proportionality extend to the whole solar system, if a solar system can be 
supposed? 

In the year 1892, a fifth satellite of Jupiter was discovered. Maybe it 
would conform to Kepler's law, if anybody could find out accurately in what 
time the faint speck does revolve. The sixth and seventh satellites of 
Jupiter revolve so eccentrically that, in line of sight, their orbits 
intersect. Their distances are subject to very great variations; but, 
inasmuch as it might be said that their mean distances do conform to 
Kepler's Third Law, or would, if anybody could find out what their mean 
distances are, we go on to the others. The eighth and ninth conform to 
nothing that can be asserted. If one of them goes around in one orbit at one 
time, the next time around it goes in some other orbit and in some other 
plane. Inasmuch then as Kepler's Third Law, deduced from the system of 
Jupiter's satellites, can not be thought to extend even within that minor 
system, one's thoughts stray into wondering what two pins in a cushion in 
Louisville, Ky., look like from somewhere up in the Bronx, rather than to 
dwell any more upon extension of any such pseudo-proportionality to the 
supposed solar system, as a whole.(5) 

It seems that in many of Kepler's demonstrations was this failure to have 
grounds for a starting-point, before extending his reasoning. He taught the 
doctrine of the music of the spheres, and assigned bass voices to Saturn and 
Jupiter, then tenor to Mars, contralto to the female planet, and soprano, or 
falsetto, [70/71] rather, to little Mercury. And that is all very well and 
consistently worked out in detail, and it does seem reasonable that, if 
ponderous, if not lumpy, Jupiter does sing bass, the other planets join in, 
according to sex and huskiness -- however, one does feel dissatisfied. 

We have dealt with Newcomb's account. But other conventionalists say that 
Kepler worked out his Third Law by triangulation upon Venus and Mercury, 
when at greatest elongation, "finding" that the relation between Mercury and 
Venus is the same as the relation between Venus and this earth. If, 
according to conventionalists, there was no "proof" that this earth moves, 
in Kepler's time, Kepler started by assuming that this earth moves between 
Venus and Mars; he assumed that the distance of Venus from the sun, at 
greatest elongation, represents mean distance; he assumed that observations 
upon Mercury indicated Mercury's orbit, an orbit that to this day defies 
analysis.(6) However, for the sake of seeming to have opposition, we shall 
try to think that Kepler's data did give him material for the formulation of 
his law. His data were chiefly the observations of Tycho Brahé. But, by the 
very same data, Tycho had demonstrated that this earth does not move between 
Venus and Mars; that this earth is stationary. That stoutest of 
conventionalists, but at the same time seeming colleague of ours, Richard 
Proctor, says that Tycho Brahé's system was consistent with all data. I have 
never heard of an astronomer who denies this. Then the heart of modern 
astronomy is not Keplerism, but is one diversion of data that beat for such 
a monstrosity as something like Siamese Twins, serving both Keplerism and 
the Tychonic system. I fear that some of our attempts to find opposition are 
not very successful. 

So far, this mediæval doctrine, restricting to times and distances, though 
for all I know the planets sing proportionately as well as move 
proportionately, has data to interpret or to misinterpret. But, when it 
comes to extending Kepler's Third Law to the exterior planets, I have never 
read of any means that Kepler had of determining their proportional 
distances. He simply said that Mars and Jupiter and Saturn were at distances 
that proportionalized with their times. He argued, reasonably enough, 
[71/72] perhaps, that the slower-moving planets are the remoter, but that 
has nothing to do with proportional remoteness. 

This is the pseudo heart of phantom astronomy. 

To it Sir Isaac Newton gave a seeming of coherence. 

I suspect that it was not by chance that the story of an apple should so 
importantly appear in two mythologies. The story of Newton and the apple was 
first told by Voltaire.(7) One has suspicions of Voltaire's meanings. 
Suppose Newton did see an apple fall to the ground, and was so inspired, or 
victimized, into conceiving in terms of universal attraction. But had he 
tried to take a bone away from a dog, he would have had another impression, 
and would have been quite as well justified in explaining in terms of 
universal repulsion. If, as to all inter-acting things, electric, biologic, 
psychologic, economic, sociologic, magnetic, chemic, as well as canine, 
repulsion is as much of a determinant as is attraction, the Law of 
Gravitation, which is an attempt to explain in terms of attraction only, is 
as false as would be dogmas upon all other subjects if couched in terms of 
attraction only.(8) So it is that the law of gravitation has been a rule of 
chagrin and fiasco. So, perhaps accepting, or passionately believing in 
every symbol of it, a Dr. Adams calculates that the Leonids will appear in 
November, 1899 -- but chagrin and fiasco -- the Leonids do not appear. The 
planet Neptune was not discovered mathematically, because, though it was in 
the year 1846, somewhere near the position of the formula, in the year 1836 
or 1856, it would have been nowhere near the orbit calculated by Leverrier 
and Adams. Some time ago, against the clamor that a Trans-Uranian planet had 
been discovered mathematically, it was our suggestion that, if this be not a 
myth, let the astronomer now discover the Trans-Neptunian planet 
mathematically. That there is no such mathematics, in the face of any number 
of learned treatises, is far more strikingly betrayed by those shining 
little misfortunes, the satellites of Jupiter. Satellite after satellite of 
Jupiter was discovered, but by accident or by observation, and not once by 
calculation: never were the perturbations of the earlier known satellites 
made the material for deducing the positions of other satellites.(9) 
Astronomers have pointed to the sky, and there has been nothing; one of them 
pointed in four directions at once, and four times [72/73] over, there was 
nothing; and many times when they have not pointed at all, there has been 
something.(10) 

Apples fall to the ground, and dogs growl, if their bones are taken away: 
also flowers bloom in the spring, and a trodden worm turns. 

Nevertheless strong is the delusion that there is gravitational astronomy, 
and the great power of the Law of Gravitation, in popular respectfulness, is 
that it is mathematically expressed. According to my view, one might as well 
say that it is fetishly expressed. Descartes was as great a mathematician as 
Newton: veritably enough it may be said that he invented, or discovered, 
analytic geometry; only patriotically do Englishmen say that Newton 
invented, or discovered, the infinitesimal calculus.(11) Descartes, too, 
formulated a law of the planets and not by a symbol was he less bewildering 
and convincing to the faithful, but his law was not in terms of gravitation, 
but in terms of vorticose motion.(12) In the year 1732, the French Academy 
awarded a prize to John Bernouli, for his magnificent mathematical 
demonstration, which was as unintelligible as anybody's. Bernouli, too, 
formulated, or said he formulated, planetary inter-actions, as 
mathematically as any of his hypnotized admirers could have desired: it, 
too, was not gravitational.(13) 

The fault that I find with a great deal of mathematics in astronomy is the 
fault that I should find in architecture, if a temple, or a skyscraper, were 
supposed to prove something. Pure mathematics is architecture: it has no 
more place in astronomy than has the Parthenon. It is the arbitrary: it will 
not spoil a line nor dent a surface for a datum. There is a faint uniformity 
in every chaos: in discolorations on an old wall, anybody can see 
recognizable appearances; in such a mixture a mathematician will see squares 
and circles and triangles. If he would merely elaborate triangles and not 
apply his diagrams to theories upon the old wall itself, his constructions 
would be as harmless as poetry. In our metaphysics, unity can not, of 
course, be the related. A mathematical expression of unity can not, except 
approximately, apply to a planet, which is not final, but is part of 
something. 

Sir Isaac Newton lived long ago. Every thought in his mind [73/74] was a 
reflection of his era. To appraise his mind at all comprehensively, consider 
his works in general. For some other instances of his love of numbers, see, 
in his book upon the Prophecies of Daniel, his determinations upon the 
eleventh horn of Daniel's fourth animal.(14) If that demonstration be not 
very acceptable nowadays, some of his other works may now be archaic. For 
all I know Jupiter may sing bass, either smoothly or lumpily, and for all I 
know there may be some formulable ratio between an eleventh horn of a fourth 
animal and some other quantity: I complain against the dogmas that have 
solidified out of the vaporings of such minds, but I suppose I am not very 
substantial, myself. Upon general principles, I say that we take no ships of 
the time of Newton for models for the ships of today, and build and 
transport in ways that are magnificently, or perhaps disastrously, 
different, but that, at any rate, are not the same; and that the principles 
of biology and chemistry and all the other sciences, except astronomy, are 
not what they were in Newton's time, whether every one of them is a delusion 
or not. My complaint is that the still mediæval science of astronomy holds 
back alone in a general appearance of advancement, even though there 
probably never has been real advancement. 

There is something else to be said upon Keplerism and Newtonism. It is a 
squirm. I fear me that our experiences have sophisticated us. We have noted 
the division in Keplerism, by which, like everything else that we have 
examined, it is as truly interpretable one way as it is another way. 

The squirm: 

To lose all sense of decency and value of data, but to be agreeable; but to 
be like everybody else, and intend to turn our agreeableness to profit; 

To agree with the astronomers that Kepler's three laws are, not absolutely 
true, of course, but are approximations, and that the planets do move, as in 
Keplerian doctrine they are said to move -- but then to require only one 
demonstration that this earth is one of the planets; 

To admire Newton's Principia from the beginning to the end of it, having, 
like almost all other admirers, never even seen a copy of it; to accept 
every theorem in it, without having the [74/75] slightest notion what any 
one of them means; to accept that moving bodies do obey the laws of motion, 
and must move in one of the conic sections -- but then to require only one 
demonstration that this earth is a moving body. 

Kepler's three laws are probably supposed to demonstrate that this earth 
moves around the sun. This is a mistake. There is something wrong with 
everything that is popular. As was said, by us, before, accept that this 
earth is stationary, and Kepler's doctrines apply equally well to a sun 
around which proportionately interspaced planets move in ellipses, the whole 
system moving around a central and stationary earth. All observations upon 
the motions of heavenly bodies are in accord with this interpretation of 
Kepler's laws. Then as to nothing but a quandary, which means that this 
earth is stationary, or which means that this earth is not stationary, just 
as one pleases, Sir Isaac Newton selected, or pleased himself and others. 
Without one datum, without one little indication more convincing one way 
than the other, he preferred to think that this earth is one of the moving 
planets. To this degree had he the "profundity" that we read about. He wrote 
no books upon the first and second horns of his dilemma: he simply 
disregarded the dilemma. 

To anybody who may be controversially inclined, I offer simplification. He 
may feel at a disadvantage against batteries of integrals and bombardments 
of quaternions, transcendental functions, conics, and all the other stores 
of an astronomer's munitions -- 

Admire them. Accept that they do apply to the bodies that move around the 
sun. Require one demonstration that this earth is one of those bodies. For 
treatment of any such "demonstration," see our disquisition, or our 
ratiocinations upon the Three Abstrusities, or our intolerably painful 
attempts to write seriously upon the Three Abstrusities. 

We began with three screams from an exhilarated mathematician. We have had 
some doubtful adventures, trying hard to pretend that monsters, or little 
difficulties, did really oppose us. We have reached, not the heart of the 
system, but the crotch of quandary. [75]

Kepler's third law is "not yet complete" and that "it is known from 
observation that the planets do not move in exact accordance with Kepler's 
laws." Newcomb also provides two laws, such as exist "nowhere else in the 
solar system," concerning the three inner satellites of Jupiter: "1. That 
the mean motion of the first satellite added to twice the mean motion of the 
third is exactly equal to three times the mean motion of the second. 1. That 
if to the mean longitude of the first satellite we add twice the mean 
longitude of the third, and subtract three times the mean longitude of the 
second, the difference is always 180." Ibid: 1st ed., 337-8; 2nd ed., 347-8.

Watts & Co., 1909; 50, 114. The theory of the Jovian satellites was further 
refined by Laplace, Damoiseau, Leverrier, and John Couch Adams. The motions 
of the satellites had been exactingly examined with consideration towards 
the influence of Jupiter's shape, their mutual perturbative interactions 
(amongst the four satellites), and Saturn, on a scale that was to measure 
the inequality of the motion of each, to a ten-thousandth of a second, over 
the next 500 years; but, these measures were determined in 1885, after the 
revision of Laplace's Mecanique Celeste in 1882, and before the discovery of 
any additional satellites. John Couch Adams. The Scientific Papers of John

5. If Saturn's moons were considered as models, the existence of the co-
orbital satellites Janus and Epimetheus would add another possibility, as 
they exchange places in each other's orbits every four years. The third law 
of Kepler was also rejected in the case of the Saturnian system. Newcomb, 
(who cautioned: "The masses of many of the planets are still very 
uncertain"), noted: "The most noteworthy deviation is in the case of Saturn, 
of which Leverrier has found the mass to be 1/3529.6, a result entirely 
incompatible with the observations of the satellites." Simon Newcomb.

6. The principal reasoning for placing Earth between Venus and Mars, (apart 
from following the Copernican model of the solar system), was the period of 
the revolution of these planets. In the introduction of Astronomia Nova, 
Kepler asks: "Unless we are to be forced to admit the absurd conclusion that 
the sun is moved by the earth, we must allow the sun to be fixed and the 
earth to move. What shall I say of the motion's periodic time of 365 days, 
intermediate in quantity between the periodic time of Mars of 687 days and 
that of Venus of 225 days? Does not the nature of things cry out with a 
great voice that the circuit in which these 365 days are used up also 
occupies a place intermediate between those of Mars and Venus about the sun, 
and thus itself also encircles the sun, and not of the sun about the earth?"

8. "If it is not an occult quality then, so Leibniz maintained, `the 
attraction of bodies, properly so-called, is a miraculous thing.' According 
to Leibniz, such attraction at a distance was unacceptable, being 
`inexplicable, unintelligible, precarious, groundless and unexampled.' Like 
so many of his contemporaries, Leibniz was much happier explaining the 
motion of the planets in terms of vortices in a Cartesian aether, and had 
such a theory been worked out in detail with the success of Newton's, there 
can be little doubt as to which would have prevailed." A significant 
difference between Newton's theory of gravitation and that of Einstein is 
that Newton's identifies gravitational forces as "attractions," whereas 
Einstein's is "indifferent as between attraction and repulsion." John D.

observation; Perrine discovered Himalia and Elara, (satellites 6 and 7), in 
1904; Melotte discovered Pasiphae, (satellite 8) in 1908; and, Nicholson 
discovered Sinope, (satellite 9), in 1914. Four more satellites, (Lysithea, 
Carme, Ananke, and Leda), were discovered from 1938 to 1974; and, three more 
satellites, (Metis, Adrastea, and Thebe), were discovered by the Voyageur 1 
and 2 spacecraft in 1979. After Barnard's Amalthea, the next eight 
satellites were all discovered from examinations of photographic plates. 
Amalthea and the Galilean satellites, (or "regular satellites"), follow 
spin-orbit coupling and are mutually perturbed by "the puzzling Laplace 
resonance." The orbits of the remaining satellites are "located at relative 
distances from Jupiter similar to those of the terrestrial planets from the 
sun," but these "irregular satellites" are characterized differently. "With 
the exception of Himalia, and perhaps Elara (J7), the outer satellites are 
difficult objects to observe photoelectrically because of their faintness 
and their poorly defined ephemerides." D. Morrison and, J.A. Burns. "The

CHAPTER ELEVEN





WE have seen that some of the most brilliant inspirations of god-like 
intellects, or some of the most pestilential emanations from infected minds, 
have been attempts to account for the virtual changelessness of the stars. 
Above all other data of astronomy, that virtual changelessness of positions 
stands out as a crucial circumstance in my own mind. To account for 
constellations that have not changed in 2,000 years, astronomers say that 
they conceive of inconceivable distances. We shall have expressions of our 
own upon the virtual changeless positions of the stars; but there will be 
difficulties for us if the astronomers ever have found that some stars move 
around or with other stars. I shall take up the story of Prof. Struve and 
the "Companion of Procyon," with more detail, for the sake of some more 
light upon refinement, exactness, accuracy in astronomy, and for the sake of 
belittling, or for the sake of sneering, or anything else that anybody may 
choose to call it. 

Prof. Struve's announcement of his discovery of the "Companion of Procyon" 
is published in the Monthly Notices, 33-430 -- that, upon the 19th of March, 
1873, Struve had discovered the companion of Procyon, having compared it 
micrometrically, having tested his observations with three determinations of 
position-angle, three measures of distance, and three additional 
determinations of position-angle, finding all in "excellent agreement."(1) 
No optical illusion could be possible, it is said, because another 
astronomer, Lindemann, had seen the object. Technically, Struve publishes a 
table of his observations: sidereal times, distances, position-angles; from 
March 19 to April 2, 1873, after which his observations had to be 
discontinued until the following year. In Monthly Notices, 34-355, are 
published the resumed observations.(2) Struve says that Auwers would not 
accept the discovery, unless, in the year that had elapsed, the "companion" 
had shown increase in position, consistent with theory. Struve writes -- 
"This [76/77] increase has really shown itself in the most remarkable 
manner." Therefore, he considers it "decisively established" that the object 
of his observations was the object of Auwers' calculations.(3) He says that 
Ceraski, of Moscow, had seen the "companion," "without being warned of the 
place where it was to be looked for." 

However -- see back some chapters.(4) 

It may be said that, nevertheless, other stars have companions that do move 
as they should move. Later we shall consider this subject, thinking that it 
may be that lights have been seen to change position near some stars, but 
that never has a star revolved around another star, as to fit palæo-
astronomic theory it should. I take for a basis of analogy that never has 
one sat in a park and watched a tree revolve around one, but that given the 
affliction, or the endowment, of an astronomer, illusion of such a 
revolution one may have. We sit in a park. We notice a tree. Wherever we get 
the notion, we do have the notion that the tree has moved. Then, farther 
along, we notice another tree, and, as an indication of our vivid 
imagination or something else, we think it is the same tree, farther along. 
After that we pick out tree after tree, farther along, and, convinced that 
it is the same tree, of course conclude that the thing is revolving around 
us. Exactness and refinement develop: we compute the elements of its orbit. 
We close our eyes and predict where the tree will be when next we look; and 
there, by the same process of selection and identification, it is where it 
"should" be. And if we have something of almost everybody's mania for speed, 
we make that dam thing spin around with such velocity that we, too, reel in 
a chaos of very much unsettled botanic conventions.(5) There is nothing far-
fetched in this analogy, except the factor of velocity. Goldschmidt did 
announce that there were a half a dozen faint points of light around Sirius, 
and it was Dawes' suspicion that Clark had arbitrarily picked out one of 
them. It is our expression that all around Sirius, at various distances from 
Sirius, faint points of light were seen, and that at first, even for the 
first sixteen years, astronomers were not thoroughly hypnotized, and would 
not pick out the especial point of light that they should have picked out, 
so that there was nothing like agreement between [77/78] the calculated and 
the observed orbit. Besides the irreconcilable observations noted by 
Flammarion, see the Intel. Obs., 1-482, for others.(6) Then came 
standardized seeing. So, in the Observatory, 20-73, is published a set of 
observations, in the year 1896, upon the "Companion of Sirius," placing it 
exactly where it should be.(7) Nevertheless, under this set of observations 
is published another set, so different that the Editor asks -- "Does this 
mean that there are two companions?" 

Dark Companions require a little more eliminative treatment. So the variable 
nebulæ, then -- and do dark nebulæ revolve around light nebulæ? For 
instances of variable nebulæ, see Mems. R.A.S., 49-214; Comptes Rendus, 59-
637; Monthly Notices, 38-104.(8) It may be said that they are not of the 
Algol-type. Neither is Algol, we have shown.(9) 

According to the compulsions of data, our idea is that the stars that seem 
to be fixed in position are fixed in position, so now "proper motion" is as 
irreconcilable to us as relative motions. 

As to "proper motion," the situation is this: 

The stars that were catalogued 2,000 years ago have virtually not changed, 
or, if there be refinement in modern astronomy, have changed no more than a 
little more nearly exact charting would account for; but, in astronomic 
theory, the stars are said to be thought of as flying apart at unthinkable 
velocity; so then evidence of changed positions of stars is welcome to 
astronomers.(10) As to well-known constellations, it can not be said that 
there has been change; so, with several exceptions, "proper motion" is 
attributed to stars that are not well-known. 

The result is an amusing trap. Great proper motion is said to indicate 
relative nearness to this earth. Of the twenty-five stars of supposed 
greatest proper motion, all but two are faintest of stars; so these twenty-
three are said to be nearest this earth. But when astronomers take the 
relative parallax of a star, by reference to a fainter star, they agree that 
the fainter star, because fainter, is farther away. So one time faintness 
associates with nearness, and then conveniences change, and faintness 
associates with farness, and the whole subject so associates with humourous- 
[78/79] ness, that if we're going to be serious at all in these expressions 
of ours we had better pass on.

Observatory, March, 1914:(11) 

A group of three stars that disappeared. 

If three stars disappeared at once, they were acted upon by something that 
affected all in common. Try to think of some one force that would not tear 
the seeable into visible rags, that could blot out three stars, if they were 
trillions of miles apart. If they were close together that ends the 
explanation that only because stars are trillions of miles apart have they, 
for at least 2,000 years, seemed to hold the same relative positions. 

In Agnes Clerke's System of the Stars are cited many instances of stars that 
seem to be so closely related that it seems impossible to think that they 
are trillions, or billions, or millions of miles apart: such formations as 
"seven aligned stars appearing to be strung on a silvery filament."(12) 
There are loops of stars in a cluster in Auriga; lines and arches in 
Opiuchus; zig-zag figures in Sagittarius.(13) As to stars that not only seem 
close together but that are colored alike, Miss Clerke expresses her feeling 
that they are close together -- "If these colors be inherent, it is 
difficult to believe that the stars distinguished by them are simply thrown 
together by perspective."(14) As to figures in Sagittarius, Fison (Recent 
Advances in Astronomy) cites an instance of 30 small stars in the form of a 
forked twig, with dark rifts parallel.(15) According to Fison, probability 
is overwhelmingly against the three uncommon stars in the belt of Orion 
falling into a straight line, by chance distribution, considering also that 
below this line is another of five faint stars parallel. There are dark 
lanes or rifts in the Milky Way that are like branches from main lines or 
rifts, and the rifts sometimes have well-defined edges. In many regions 
where there are dark rifts there are lines of stars that are roughly 
parallel -- 

That it is not distances apart that have held the stars from changing 
relatively to one another, because there are hosts of indications that some 
stars are close together, and are, or have been, affected, in common, by 
local formative forces. [79/80] 




* * *



For a detailed comparison, by J.E. Gore, of stars of today with stars 
catalogued by Al-Sufi about 1,000 years ago, see the Observatory, vol. 
23.(16) The stars have not changed in position, but it does seem that there 
have been many changes in magnitude. 

Other changes -- Pubs. Astro. Soc. Pacific, No. 185 (1920) -- discovery of 
the seventeenth new star in one nebula (Andromeda).(17) For lists of stars 
that have disappeared, see Monthly Notices, 8-16, 10-18, 11-47; Sidereal 
Messenger, 6-320; Jour. B.A.A., 14-255.(18) Nebulae that have disappeared -- 
see Amer. Jour. Sci., 2-33-436; Clerke's System of the Stars, p. 293; 
Nature, 30-20.(19) 

In the Sidereal Messenger, 5-269, Prof. Colbert writes that, upon August 20, 
1886, an astronomer, in Chicago, saw, for about half an hour, a small comet-
like projection from the star Zeta, in Cassiopeia.(20) 

So, then, changes have been seen at the distance of the stars. 

When the new star in Perseus appeared, in February, 1901, it was a point of 
light. Something went out from it, giving it in six months a diameter equal 
to half the apparent diameter of the moon. The appearances looked 
structural. To say loosely that they were light-effects, something like a 
halo, perhaps, is to ignore their complexity and duration and differences. 
According to Newcomb, who is occasionally quotable in our favor, these 
radiations were not merely light-rays, because they did not go out uniformly 
from the star, but moved out variously and knotted and curved. 

It was visible motion, at the distance of Nova Persei. 

In Monthly Notices, 58-334, Dr. Espin writes that, upon the night of Jan. 
16, 1898, he saw something that looked like a cloud in Perseus.(21) It could 
have been nothing in the atmosphere of this earth, nor anything far from the 
constellation, because he saw it again in Perseus, upon Jan. 24. He writes 
that, upon Feb. 17, Mr. Heath and Dr. Halm saw it, like a cloud, dimming and 
discoloring stars shining through it. At the meeting the British 
Astronomical Association, Feb. 23, 1898 (Jour. B.A.A., 8-216) Dr. Espin 
described this appearance and answered questions.(22) "It was not a nebula, 
and was it like one." [80/81] "Whatever it was it had the peculiar property 
of dimming and blotting out stars." 

This thing moved into Perseus and then moved away. 

Clerke, System of the Stars, p.295 -- a nebula that changed position 
abruptly, between the years 1833 and 1835, and then changed no more.(23) 
According to Sir John Herschel, a star was central in this nebula, when 
observed in 1827, and in 1833, but, in August, 1835, the star was upon the 
eastern side of the nebula. 

That it is not distance from this earth that has kept changes of positions 
of the stars from being seen, for 2,000 years, because occasional, abrupt 
changes of position have been seen at the distance of the stars. 




* * *



That, whether there be a shell-like, revolving composition, holding the 
stars in position, and in which the stars are openings, admitting light from 
an existence external to the shell, or not, all stars are at about the same 
distance from this earth, as they would be if this earth were stationary and 
central to such a shell, revolving around it -- 

According to the aberration-forms of the stars. 

All stars, at the pole of the ecliptic, describe circles annually; stars 
lower down describe ellipses that reduce more and more the farther down they 
are, until at the ecliptic they describe straight lines yearly. 

Suppose all the stars to be openings, fixed in position relatively to one 
another, in some inter-spacing substance. Conceive if a gyration to the 
whole aggregation, and relatively to a central and stationary earth: then, 
as seen from this earth, all would describe circles, near the axis, ellipses 
lower down, and straight lines at the limit of transformation. If all were 
at the same distance from this earth, or if all were points in one gyrating 
concave formation, equi-distant to all points from the central earth, all 
would have the same amplitude. All aberration- forms of the stars, whether 
of brilliant or faint stars, whether circles or ellipses or straight lines, 
have the same amplitude: about 41 seconds of arc.(24) 




* * *



If all stars are points of light admitted from externality, held [81/82] 
fixed and apart in one shell-like composition that is opaque in some parts 
and translucent in some parts and perforated generally -- 

The Gegenschein -- 

That we have indication that there is such a shell around our existence. 

The Gegenschein is a round patch of light in the sky. It seems to be 
reflected sunlight, at night, because it keeps position about opposite the 
sun's. 

The crux: 

Reflected sunlight -- but reflecting from what? 

That the sky is a matrix, in which the stars are openings, and that, upon 
the inner, concave surface of this celestial shell, the sun casts its light, 
even if the earth is between, no more blotted out in the middle by the 
intervening earth than often to considerable degree is its light blotted out 
upon the moon during an eclipse of the moon, occupying no time in traveling 
the distance of the stars and back to this earth, because the stars are 
near, or because there is no velocity of light. 

Suppose the Gegenschein could be a reflection of sunlight from anything at a 
distance less than the distance of the stars. It would have parallax against 
its background of stars. 

Observatory, 17-47:(25) 

"The Gegenschein has no parallax." 




* * *



At the meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society, Jan. 11, 1878, was read a 
paper by W.F. Denning.(26) It was, by its implications, one of the most 
exciting documents in history. The subject was: "Suspected repetitions in 
meteor-showers." Mr. Denning listed twenty-two radiants that lasted from 
three to four months each. 

In the year 1799, Humboldt noticed that the paths of meteors, when parts of 
one display, led back to one point of common origin, or one point from which 
all the meteors radiated.(27) This is the radiant-point, or the radiant. 
When a radiant occurs under a constellation, the meteors are named 
relatively. In the extraordinary meteoric display of November 13-14, 1833, 
there was a circumstance that was as extraordinary as the display it- 
[82/83] self: that, though this earth is supposed to rotate upon its axis, 
giving to the stars the appearance of revolving nightly, and supposed to 
revolve around the sun, so affecting the seeming motions of the stars, these 
meteors of November, 1833, began under the constellation Leo, and six hours 
later, though Leo had changed position in the sky, had changed with, and 
seemed still coming from, Leo. 

There was no parallax along the great base line from Canada to Florida. 

Then these meteors did come from Leo, or parallax, or absence of parallax, 
is meaningless. 

The circumstance of precise position maintained under a moving constellation 
upon the night of Nov. 13-14, 1833, becomes insignificant relatively to 
Denning's data of such synchronization with a duration of months. When a 
radiant-point remains under Leo or Lyra, night after night, month after 
month, it is either that something is shifting it, without parallax, in 
exact coincidence with a doubly shifting constellation, which is so 
unthinkable that Denning says, "I can not explain," or that the 
constellation is the radiant-point, in which case maintenance of precise 
position under it is unthinkable if it be far away -- 

That the stars are near. 

Think of a ship, slowly sailing past a seacoast town, firing with smokeless 
powder, say. Shells from it burst before quite reaching the town, and all 
explosion-points are in line between the city and the ship, or are traceable 
to one such radiant. The bombardment continues. The ship moves slowly. Still 
all points of exploding shells are traceable to one point between the ship 
and the town. The bombardment goes on and goes on and goes on, and the ship 
is far from its first position. The point of exploding shells is still 
between the ship and the town. Wise men in the town say that the shells are 
not coming from the ship. They say this because formerly they had said that 
shells could not come from a ship. They reason: therefore shells are not 
coming from this ship. They are asked how, then, the point of explosion 
could so shift exactly in line with the moving ship. If there be a W.F. 
Denning among them, he will say, "I can not explain." But the other wise men 
will be like [83/84] Prof. Moulton, for instance. In his books, Prof. 
Moulton writes a great deal upon the subject of meteors, but he does not 
mention the meteors that, for months at a time, appear between observers and 
a shifting constellation.(28) 

There are other considerations. The shells are heard to explode. So then 
they explode near the town. But there is something the matter with that 
smokeless powder aboard ship: very feeble projectile-force, because also 
must the shells be exploding near the ship, or the radiant-point would not 
have the same background, as seen from different parts of the town. Then, in 
this town, inhabitants, provided they be not wise men, will conclude that, 
if the explosion-point is near the town, and is also near the ship, the ship 
is near the town -- 

Leo and Lyra and Andromeda -- argosies that sail the sky and that bombard 
this earth -- and that they are not far away. 

And some of us there may be who, instead of trying to speculate upon an 
unthinkable remoteness, will suffer a sensitiveness to proximity instead; 
enter a new revolt against a black encompassment that glitters with a light 
beyond, and wonder what exists in a brilliant environment not far away -- 
and a new anguish for hyperæsthesia upon this earth: a suffocating 
consciousness of the pressure of the stars. 

The Sickle of Leo, from which come the Leonids, gleams like a great 
question-mark in the sky. 

The answer -- 

But God knows what the answer to anything is. 

Perhaps it is that the stars are very close indeed. [84]

10. While seeking to determine the precession of the equinoxes, Halley 
detected minor changes in the latitudes amounting to about 20' for Aldebaran 
(Palilicium), about 33' for Arcturus, and about 22' for Sirius, from those 
in Ptolemy's Almagest. Halley dismissed the possibility that changes in 
these measurements were errors made by Hipparchus, Timocharis, and Ptolemy, 
some "1800 years" before; for, he noted that the latitude of Sirius had 
increased 4.5', though it should have only changed 2.5' since Tycho Brahé 
had charted it: "One half of this difference may perhaps be excused, if 
refraction were not allowed in this case by Tycho; yet two minutes, in such 
a star as Sirius, is somewhat too much for him to be mistaken." Also, an 
occultation of Aldebaran by the moon at Athens, in 509 A.D., would not have 
seemed possible if its latitude had not changed beyond that expected as a 
result of precession. Yet, in the various editions of the Almagest, there 
are many instances of differences in latitudes; for examples: of "- 23" and 
"- 20-1/3" in the case of Alpha Piscis Austrinus, and, of "- 44-1/6" and "- 
41-1/6" in the case of Alpha Centauri, (both being first magnitude stars). 
Ptolemy also makes note of variations in the latitudes of the stars between 
the time of his measures and those of Hipparchus and Timocharis, which he 
attributes to a precession of 1 in 100 years, (though errors abound in the 
observations and computations). Angus Armitage. Edmond Halley. London:

24. In the early attempts to determine a (heliocentric) parallax to the 
stars, by Robert Hooke (for Vega), Flamsteed (for Draconis, Gamma Draconis), 
and Olaus Römer (for Vega and Sirius), what was being measured was the 
"aberration" of the light. Oliver Lodge. Pioneers of Science. London: 
Macmillan and Co., 1893: 246-52, 308. If the identical "constant of 
aberration" of all stars, (allegedly produced by this earth's movement at 
some 19 miles per second in orbit around the sun), had instead been 
identified as a measured heliocentric parallax to the stars, it might have 
been considered by the followers of Copernicus that a shell of stars did 
exist at a distance of about 10,000 astronomical units. Tycho Brahé placed 
the region of the stars at distance of 14,000 semi-diameters (radii) of the 
Earth; and, if the Earth were stationary in a Tychonic system, there would 
be no aberration of light nor any parallax based upon heliocentric 
measurements. J.L.E. Dreyer. History of the Planetary Systems from Thales to 
Kepler. Cambridge: University Press, 1906, 363-5. John Charles Duncan.

The discrepancy between the parallax measure, sought by James Bradley, and 
what he observed was the displacement of Draconis (Gamma Draconis) 90 from 
its expected direction; thus, Bradley was to discover the larger measure of 
"aberration," whereas another century would pass before the earliest 
determinations of lesser measures of (heliocentric) parallax would be 
obtained by Bessel, Henderson and Meadows. Agnes Mary Clerke. The System of

CHAPTER TWELVE





WE try to have independent expressions. Accept that it is not distance that 
has held the stars in unchanging position, if occasional, abrupt change of 
position has been seen at the distance of the stars, and it is implied that 
the not enormously distant stars are all about equally far away from this 
earth, or some would be greatly particularized, and that this earth does not 
move in an orbit, or stars would be seasonally particularized, but would not 
be, if the stars, in one composition revolve; also if this earth be 
relatively close to all stars, if many changes of magnitude and of 
appearance and disappearance have been seen at the distance of the stars, 
and, if, in the revolutions of the stars, they do not swirl in displacements 
as bewildering as a blizzard of luminous snowflakes, and if no state of 
inter-repulsion can be thought of, especially as many stars merge into 
others, this composition is a substantial, concave formation, or shell-like 
enclosure in which stars are points. So many of the expressions in the 
preceding chapter imply others, or all others. However, we have tried to 
have independent expressions. Of course we realize that the supposed 
difference between inductive and deductive reasoning is a false demarcation; 
nevertheless we feel that deductions piled upon other deductions are only 
architecture, and a great deal in this book expresses the notion that 
architecture should be kept in its own place. Our general expression is not 
that there should be no architecture and no mathematics in astronomy, or 
neo-astronomy; not that there should be no poetry in biology; no chemistry 
in physiology -- but that "pure" architecture or "pure" mathematics, 
biology, chemistry, has its own field, even though each in inextricably 
bound up with all the other aspects of being. So of course the very thing 
that we object to in its extreme manifestations is essential to us in some 
degree, and the deductive is findable somewhere in every one of [85/86] our 
inductions, and we are not insensible to what we think is the gracefulness 
of some of the converging lines of our own constructions. We are not 
revolting against aspects, but against emphases and intrusions. 

The first part of our work is what we consider neo-astronomic; and now to 
show that we have no rabidity against the mathematical except when over-
emphasized, or misapplied, our language is that all expressions so far 
developed are to us about 50% acceptability. A far greater attempted 
independence is coming, a second part of this work, considering phenomena so 
different that, if we term the first part of our explorations "neo-
astronomic," even some other term, by which to designate the field of the 
second part will have to be thought of, and the word "extra-geographic" 
seems best for it. If in these two fields, our at least temporary 
conclusions be the same, we shall be impressed, in spite of all our 
cynicisms as to "agreements." 

Neo-astronomy: 

This supposed solar system -- an egg-like organism that is shelled away from 
external light and life -- this central and stationary earth its nucleus -- 
around it a revolving shell, in which the stars are pores, or functioning 
channels, through some of which spray irradiating fountains said to be 
"meteoric," but perhaps electric -- in which the nebulae are translucent 
patches, and in which the many dark parts are areas of opaque, structural 
substance -- and that the stars are not trillions nor even millions of miles 
away -- with proportional reductions of all internal distances, so that the 
planets are not millions, nor even hundreds of thousands of miles away. 

We conceive of the variability of the stars and the nebulae in terms of the 
incidence of external light upon a revolving shell and fluctuating passage 
through light-admitting points and parts. We conceive of all things being 
rhythmic, so, if stars be pores in a substance, that matrix must be subject 
to some changes, which may be of different periodicities in different 
regions. There may be local vortices in the most rigid substance, and so 
stars, or pores, might revolve around one another, but our tendency is to 
think that if light companions there be to some stars, they are reflections 
of light, passing through channels, upon sur- [86/87] rounding substance, 
flickering from one position to another in the small undulations of this 
environment. So there may be other displacements, differences of magnitude, 
new openings and closings in a substance that is not absolutely rigid. So 
"proper motion" might be accounted for, but my own preference is to think, 
as to such stars as 1830 Groombridge and Barnard's "run-away" star," that 
they are planets -- also that some of the comets, especially the tailless 
comets, some of which have been seen to obscure stars, so that evidently 
they are not wisps of highly attenuated matter, are planets, all of them not 
conventionally recognized as planets, because of eccentricity and remoteness 
from the ecliptic, two departures, however, that many of the minor planets 
make to great degree.(1) If some of these bodies be planets, the 
irregularities of some of them are consistent with the irregularities of 
Jupiter's satellites. 

I suggest that a combination of the Ptolemaic and the Tychonic doctrines is 
in good accord with all the phenomena that we have considered, and with all 
planetary motions that we have had no occasion to pay much attention to -- 
that the sun, carrying Mercury and Venus with him, revolves at a distance of 
a few thousand miles, or a few tens of thousands of miles, in a rising and 
falling spiral around this virtually, but not absolutely, stationary earth, 
which, according to modern investigations is more top-shaped than spherical; 
moon, a few thousand miles away, revolving around this nucleus; and the 
exterior planets not only revolving around this whole central arrangement, 
but approaching and receding, in loops, also, quite as they seem to the 
remotest of them preposterously near, according to conventional 
"determinations."(2) 

So all the phenomena of the skies may be explained. But all were explained 
in another way by Copernicus, in another way by Ptolemy, and in still 
another way by Tycho Brahé. One supposes that there are other ways. If there 
be a distant object, and, if one school of wise men can by their reasoning 
processes excellently demonstrate that it is a tree, another school 
positively determine that it is a house, and other investigators of the 
highest authoritativeness variously find and prove that it is a cloud or a 
buffalo or a geranium, why then, their reason- [87/88] ing processes may be 
admired but not trusted. Right at the heart of our opposition, and right at 
the heart of our own expressions, is the fatality that there is no 
reasoning, no logic, no explanation resembling the illusions in the 
vainglories of common suppositions. There is only the process of correlating 
to, or organizing or systematizing around, something that is arbitrarily 
taken for a base, or a dominant doctrine, or a major premise -- the process 
of assimilating with something else, making agreement with something else, 
or interpreting in terms of something else, which supposed base is never 
itself final, but was originally an assimilation with still something else. 

I typify the result of all examination of all principles or laws or dominant 
thoughts, scientific, philosophic, or theologic, in what we find in 
examining the pronouncement that motion follows the least resistance: 

That motion follows least resistance. 

How do we identify least resistance? 

If motion follows it. 

Then motion goes where motion goes. 

If nothing can be positively distinguished from anything else there can be 
no positive logic, which is attempted positive distinguishment. Consider the 
popular "base" that Capital is tyranny, and almost utmost wickedness, and 
that Labor is pure and idealistic. But one's labor is one's capital, and 
capital that is not working is in no sense implicated in this conflict. 

Nevertheless we now give up our early suspicion that our whole existence is 
a leper of the skies, quaking and cringing through space, having the 
isolation that astronomers suppose, because other celestial forms of being 
fly from infection -- 

That, if shelled away from external light and life, it is so surrounded and 
so protected in the same cause and functioning as that of similarly 
encompassed forms subsidiary to it -- that our existence is super-embryonic. 

Darkness of night and of lives and of thoughts -- super-uterine entombment. 
Blackness of the unborn, quasi-illumined periodically by the little sun, 
which is not light, but less dark. 

Then we think of an organism that needs no base, and needs nothing of 
finality, nor of special guidance to any local part to [88/89] it, because 
all parts partake of the pre-determined development of the whole. 
Consequently our spleens subside, and our frequently unmannerly derisions 
are hushed by recognitions -- that all organizations of thought must be 
baseless in themselves, and of course be not final, or they could not 
change, and must bear within themselves those elements that will, in time, 
destroy them -- that seeming solidities that pass away, in phantom 
successions, are functionaries relatively to their periods, and express the 
passage from phase to phase of all things embryonic. 

So it is one who searches for fundamentals comes to bifurcations; never to a 
base; only to a quandary. In our own field, let there be any acceptable 
finding. It indicates that the earth moves around the sun. Just as truly it 
indicates that the sun moves around the earth. What is it the determines 
which will be accepted, hypnotically blinding the faithful to the other 
aspect? Our own expression is upon Development as serial reactions to 
successive Dominants. Let the dominant spirit of an era require that this 
earth be remote and isolated; Keplerism will support it: let the dominant 
change to a spirit of expansion, which would be impossible under such 
remoteness and isolation; Keplerism will support, or will not especially 
oppose, the new dominant. This is the essential process of embryonic growth, 
by which the same protoplasmic substance responds differently in different 
phases. 

But I do not think that all data are so plastic. There are some that will 
not assimilate with a prevailing doctrine. They can have no effect upon an 
arbitrary system of thought, or a system sub-consciously induced, in its 
time of dominance: they will simply be disregarded. 

We have reached our catalogue of the sights and the sounds to which all that 
we have so far considered is merely introductory. For them there are either 
no conventional explanations or poor insufficiencies half-heartedly offered. 
Our data are glimpses of an epoch that is approaching with far-away 
explosions. It is vibrating on its edges with the tread of distant space-
armies. Already it has pictured in the sky visions that signify new 
excitements, even now lapping over into the affairs of a self-disgusted, 
played-out hermitage. [89/90] 

We assemble the data, Unhappily, we shall be unable to resist the temptation 
to reason and theorize. May Super-embryology have mercy upon our own 
syllogisms. We consider that we are entitled to at least 13 pages of gross 
and stupid errors. After that we shall have to explain.(3) [90]

PART TWO

CHAPTER ONE





JUNE, 1801 -- a mirage of an unknown city. It was seen, for more than an 
hour, at Youghal, Co. Cork, Ireland -- a representation of mansions, 
surrounded by shrubbery and white palings -- forests behind. In October, 
1796, a mirage of a walled town had been seen distinctly for half an hour at 
Youghal. Upon March 9, 1797, had been seen a mirage of a walled town.(1) 

Feb. 7, 1802 -- an unknown body that was seen, by Fritsch, of Magdeburg, to 
cross the sun (Observatory, 3-136).(2) 

Oct. 10, 1802 -- an unknown dark body was seen, by Fritsch, rapidly crossing 
the sun (Comptes Rendus, 83-587).(3) 

Between 10 and 11 o'clock, morning of Oct. 8, 1803, a stone fell from the 
sky, at the town of Apt, France. About eight hours later, "some persons 
believed that they felt an earthquake," (Rept. B.A., 1854-53).(4) 

Upon August 11, 1805, an explosive sound was heard at East Haddam, 
Connecticut. There are records of six prior sounds, as if of explosions, 
that were heard at East Haddam, beginning with the year 1791, but, 
unrecorded, the sounds had attracted attention for a century, and had been 
called the "Moodus" sounds, by the Indians. For the best account of the 
"Moodus" sounds, see the Amer. Jour. Sci., 39-339.(5) Here a writer tries to 
show the phenomena were subterranean, but says that there was no 
satisfactory explanation. 

Upon the 2nd of April, 1808, over the town of Pignerol, Piedmont, Italy, a 
loud sound was heard: in many places in Piedmont an earthquake was felt. In 
the Rept. B.A., 1854-68, it is said that aërial phenomena did occur; that, 
during the explosion, luminous objects had been seen in the sky over 
Pignerol, and that in several of the communes in the Alps aërial sounds, as 
if of innumerable stones colliding, had been heard, and that quakes had been 
felt.(6) From April 2 to April 8, forty shocks [93/94] were recorded at 
Pignerol; sounds like cannonading were heard at Barga. Upon the 18th of 
April, two detonations were heard at La Tour, and a luminous object was seen 
in the sky. The supposition, or almost absolute belief of most persons is 
that from the 2nd to the 18th of April this earth moved far in its orbit and 
was rotating so that, if one should explain that probably meteors had 
exploded here, it could not very well be thought that more meteors were 
continuing to pick out this one point upon a doubly moving planet. But 
something was specially related to this one local sky. Upon the 19th of 
April, a stone fell from the sky near Borgo San Donnino, about 40 miles east 
of Piedmont (Rept. B.A., 1860).(7) Sounds like cannonading were heard almost 
every day in this small region. Upon the 13th of May, a red cloud such as 
marks the place of a meteoric explosion was seen in the sky. Throughout the 
rest of the year, phenomena that are now listed as "earthquakes" occurred in 
Piedmont. The last occurrence of which I have record was upon Jan. 22, 1810. 

Feb. 9, 1812 -- two explosive sounds at East Haddam (Amer. Jour. Sci., 39-
339). 

July 5, 1812 -- one explosive sound at East Haddam (Amer. Jour. Sci., 39-
339).(8) 

Oct. 28, 1812 -- "phantom soldiers" at Havarah Park, near Ripley, England 
(Edinburgh Annual Register, 1812-II-124).(9) When such appearances are 
explained by meteorologists, they are said to be displays of the aurora 
borealis. Psychic research explains variously. The physicists say that they 
are mirages of troops marching somewhere at a distance. 

Night of July 31, 1813 -- flashes of light in the sky of Tottenham, near 
London (Year Book of Facts, 1853-272).(10) The sky was clear. The flashes 
were attributed to a storm at Hastings, 65 miles away. We note not only that 
the planet Mars was in opposition at this time (July 30), but in one of the 
nearest of its oppositions in the 19th century. 

Dec. 28, 1813 -- an explosive sound at East Haddam.(11) 

Feb. 2, 1816 -- a quake at Lisbon. There was something in the sky. 
Extraordinary sounds were heard, but were attributed to "flocks of birds." 
But six hours later something was seen in the sky: it is said to have been a 
meteor (Rept. B.A.,, 1854-106).(12) [94/95] 

Since the year 1788, many earthquakes, or concussions that were listed as 
earthquakes, had occurred at the town of Comrie, Perthshire, Scotland. 
Seventeen instances were recorded on the year 1795. Almost all records of 
the phenomena of Comrie start with the year 1788, but, in Macara's Guide to 
Creiff, it is said that the disturbances were recorded as far back as the 
year 1597.(13) They were slight shocks, and until the occurrence upon August 
13, 1816, conventional explanations, excluding all thought of relations with 
anything in the sky, seemed adequate enough. But, in an account in the 
London Times, Aug. 21, 1816, it is said that, at the time of the quake of 
Aug. 13, a luminous object, or a "small meteor," had been seen at Dunkeld, 
near Comrie; and, according to David Milne, (Edin. New Phil. Jour., 31-110), 
a resident of Comrie had reported "a large luminous body, bent like a 
crescent, which stretched itself over the heavens."(14) 

There was another quake in Scotland (Inverness) June 30, 1817. It is said 
that hot rain fell from the sky (Rept. B.A., 1854-112).(15) 

Jan. 6, 1818 -- an unknown body that crossed the sun, according to Loft, of 
Ipswich; observed about three hours and a half (Quar. Jour. Roy. Inst., 5-
117).(16) 

Five unknown bodies that were seen, upon June 26, 1819, crossing the sun, 
according to Gruithuisen (An. Sci. Disc., 1860-411).(17) Also, upon this 
day, Pastorff saw something that he thought was a comet, which was then 
somewhere near the sun, but which, according to Olbers, could not have been 
the comet, (Webb, Celestial Objects, p.40).(18) 

Upon Aug. 28, 1819, there was a violent quake at Irkutsk, Siberia. There had 
been two shocks upon Aug. 22, 1813 (Rept. B.A., 1854-101).(19) Upon April 6, 
1805, or March 25, according to the Russian calendar, two stones had fallen 
from the sky at Irkutsk (Rept. B.A., 1860-12).(20) One of these stones is 
now in the South Kensington Museum, London.(21) Another violent shock at 
Irkutsk, April 7, 1820 (Rept. B.A., 1854-128).(22) 

Unknown bodies in the sky, in the year 1820, Feb. 12 and April 27 (Comptes 
Rendus, 83-314).(23) 

Things that marched in the sky -- see Arago's uvres, 11-576, or Annales de 
Chimie, 30-417 -- objects that were seen by many [95/96] persons, in the 
streets of Embrun, during the eclipse of Sept. 7, 1820, moving in straight 
lines, turning and retracing in the same straight lines, all of them 
separated by uniform spaces.(24) 

Early in the year 1821 -- and a light shone out on the moon -- a bright 
point of light in the lunar crater Aristarchus, which was in the dark at the 
time. It was seen, upon the 4th and the 7th of February, by Capt. Kater (An. 
Reg., 1821-689); and upon the 5th by Dr. Olbers (Mems. R.A.S., 1-159).(25) 
It was a light like a star, and was seen again, May 4th and 6th, by the Rev. 
M. Ward and by Francis Bailey (Mems. R.A.S., 1-159).(26) At Cape Town, 
nights of Nov. 28th and 29th, 1821, again a star-like light was seen upon 
the moon (Phil. Trans., 112-237).(27) 

Quar. Jour. Roy. Inst., 20-417:(28) 

That, early in the morning of March 20, 1822, detonations were heard at 
Melida, an island in the Adriatic. All day, at intervals, the sounds were 
heard. They were like cannonading, and it was supposed that they came from a 
vessel, or from Turkish artillery, practicing in some frontier village. For 
thirty days the detonation continued, sometimes thirty or forty, sometimes 
several hundred, a day. 

Upon April 13, 1822, it seems, according to description, that clearly enough 
was there an explosion in the sky of Comrie, and a concussion of the ground 
-- "two loud reports, one apparently over our heads, and the other, which 
followed immediately, under our feet" (Edin. New Phil. Jour., 31-119).(29) 

July 15, 1822 -- a fall of perhaps unknown seeds from perhaps an unknown 
world -- a great quantity of little round seeds that fell from the sky at 
Marienwerder, Germany. They were unknown to the inhabitants, who tried to 
cook them, but found that boiling seemed to have no effect upon them. 
Wherever they came from, they were brought down by a storm, and two days 
later, more of them fell, in a storm, in Silesia. It is said that these 
corpuscles were identified by some scientists as seeds of Galium spurium, 
but that other scientists disagreed. Later more of them fell at Posen, 
Mecklenburg. See Bull. des Sci. (math., astro., etc.) 1-1-298.(30) 

Aug. 19, 1822 -- a tremendous detonation at Melida -- others continuing 
several days.(31) [96/97] 

Oct. 23, 1822 -- two unknown dark bodies crossing the sun; observed by 
Pastorff (An. Sci. Disc., 1860-411).(32) 

An unknown, shining thing -- it was seen, by Webb, May 22, 1823; near the 
planet Venus (Nature, 14-195).(33) 

More unknowns, in the year 1823 -- see Comptes Rendus, 49-811 and Webb's 
Celestial Objects, p. 43.(34) 

Feb., 1824 -- the sounds of Melida.(35) 

Upon Feb. 11, 1824, a slight shock was felt at Irkutsk, Siberia, (Rept. 
B.A., 1854-124).(36) Upon Feb. 18, or, according to other accounts, upon May 
14, a stone that weighed five pounds, fell from the sky at Irkutsk (Rept. 
B.A., 1860-70).(37) Three severe shocks at Irkutsk, March 8, 1824 (Rept. 
B.A., 1854-124).(38) 

Sept., 1824 -- the sounds of Melida.(39) 

At five o'clock, morning of Oct. 20, 1824, a light was seen upon the dark 
part of the moon, by Gruithuisen. It disappeared. Six minutes later it 
appeared again, disappeared again, and then flashed intermittently, from 
5:30 A.M., until sunrise ended the observations, (Sci. Amer. Sup., 7-
2712).(40) And, upon Jan. 22, 1825, again shone out the star-like light of 
Aristarchus, reported by the Rev. J.B. Emmett, (Annals of Philosophy, 28-
338).(41) 

The last sounds of Melida of which I have record, were heard in March, 1825. 
If these detonations did come from the sky, there was something that, for at 
least three years, was situated over, or was in some other way specially 
related to, this one small part of this earth's surface, subversively to all 
supposed principles of astronomy and geodesy. It is said that, to find out 
whether the sounds did come from the sky, or not, the Prêteur of Melida went 
into underground caverns to listen. It is said that there the sounds could 
not be heard.(42) [97]

CHAPTER TWO





AND our own underground investigations -- and whether there is something in 
the sky or not. We are in a hole in time. Cavern of Conventional Science -- 
walls that are dogmas, from which drips ancient wisdom in a patter of slimy 
opinions -- but we have heard a storm of data outside -- 

Of beings that march in the sky, and of a beacon on the moon -- another dark 
body crosses the sun. Somewhere near Melida there is cannonading, and 
another stone falls from the sky at Irkutsk, Siberia; and unknown grain 
falls from an unknown world, and there are flashes in the sky when the 
planet Mars is near. 

In a farrago of lights and sounds and forms, I feel the presence of possible 
classifications that may thread a pattern of attempt to find out something. 
My attention is attracted by a streak of events that is beaded with little 
star-like points of light. First we shall find out what we can, as to the 
moon. 

In one of the numbers of the Observatory, an eminent authority, in some 
fields of research, is quoted as to the probable distance of the moon. 
According to his determinations, the moon is 37 miles away. He explains most 
reasonably: he is Mr. G.B. Shaw. But by conventional doctrine, the moon is 
240,000 miles away. My own idea is that somewhere between determinations by 
a Shaw and determinations by a Newcomb, we could find many acceptances.(1) 

I prefer questionable determinations, myself, or at any rate examinations 
that end up with questions or considerable latitude. It may be that as to 
the volcanoes of the moon we can find material for at least a seemingly 
intelligent question, if no statements are possible as to the size and the 
distance of the moon. The larger volcanoes of this earth are about three 
miles in diameter, though the craters of Haleakla, Hawaii, and Aso San, 
Japan, are seven [98/99] miles across. But the larger volcanoes of the 
relatively little moon are said to be sixty miles across, though several are 
said to be twice that size.(2) And I start off with just about the 
impression of disproportionality that I should have, if someone should tell 
me of a pygmy with ears five feet long. 

Is there any somewhat good reason for thinking that the volcanic craters of 
the little moon are larger than, or particularly different in any way from, 
the craters of this earth? 

If not, we have a direct unit of measurement, according to which the moon is 
not 2160, but about 100, miles in diameter. 

How far away does one suppose to be an object with something like that 
diameter, and of the seeming size of the moon? 

The astronomers explain. They argue that gravitation must be less powerful 
upon the moon than upon this earth, and that therefore larger volcanic 
formations could have been cast up on the moon. We explain. We argue that 
volcanic force must be less powerful upon the moon than upon this earth, and 
that therefore larger volcanic formations could not have been cast up on the 
moon. 

The disproportionality that has impressed me has offended more conventional 
æsthetics than mine. Prof. See, for instance, has tried to explain that the 
lunar formations are not craters but are effects of bombardment by vast 
meteors, which spared this earth, for some reason not made clear.(3) Viscid 
moon -- meteor pops in -- up splash walls and a central cone. If Prof. See 
will jump in swimming some day, and then go back some weeks later to see how 
big a splash he made, he will have other ideas upon such supposed 
persistences. The moon would have to have been virtually liquid to fit his 
theory, because there are no partly embedded, vast, round meteors protruding 
anywhere. 

There have been lights like signals upon the moon. There are two 
conventional explanations: reflected sunlight and volcanic action. Of 
course, ultra-conventionalists do not admit that in our own times there has 
been even volcanic action upon the moon. Our instances will be of light upon 
the dark part of the moon, and there are good reasons for thinking that our 
data do not relate to volcanic action. In volcanic eruptions upon this earth 
the glow is so accompanied by great volumes of smoke that a clear, [99/100] 
definite point of light would seem not to be the appearance from a distance. 

For Webb's account of a brilliant display of minute dots and streaks of 
light, in the Mare Crisium, July 4, 1832, see Astro. Reg., 20-165.(4) I have 
records of half a dozen similar illuminations here, in about 120 years, all 
of them when the Mare Crisium was in darkness. There can be no commonplace 
explanation for such spectacles, or they would have occurred oftener; 
nevertheless the Mare Crisium is a wide, open region, and at times there may 
have been uncommon percolations of sunlight, and I shall list no more of 
these interesting events that seem to me to have been like carnivals upon 
the moon. 

Dec. 22, 1835 -- the star-like light in Aristarchus -- reported by Francis 
Bailey -- see Proctor's Myths and Marvels, p. 329.(5) 

Feb. 13, 1826 -- in the western crater of Messier -- according to 
Gruithuisen (Sci. Amer. Sup., 7-2629) -- two straight lines of light; 
between them a dark band that was covered with luminous points.(6) 

Upon the nights of March 18 and 19, 1847, large luminous spots were seen 
upon the dark part of the moon, and a general glow upon the upper limb, by 
the Rev. T. Rankin and Prof. Chevalier (Rept. B.A., 1847-18).(7) The whole 
shaded part of the disc seemed to be a mixture of lights and shades. Upon 
the night of the 19th, there was a similar appearance upon this earth, an 
aurora, according to the London newspapers. It looks as if both the moon and 
this earth were affected by the same illumination, said to have been 
auroral. I offer this occurrence as indication that the moon is nearby, if 
moon and earth could be so affected in common. 

But by signalling, I mean something like the appearance that was seen, by 
Hodgson, upon the dark part of the moon, night of Dec. 11, 1847 -- a bright 
light that flashed intermittently. Upon the next night it was seen again, 
(Monthly Notices R.A.S., 8-55).(8) 


* * *



The oppositions of Mars occur once in about two years and two months. In 
conventional terms, the eccentricity of the orbit of Mars is greater than 
the eccentricity of the orbit of this earth, [100/101] and the part of its 
orbit that is traversed by this earth in August is nearest the orbit of 
Mars. When this earth is between Mars and the sun, Mars is said to be in 
opposition, and this is the position of nearest approach: when opposition 
occurs in August, that is the most favorable opposition. After that, every 
two years and about two months, the oppositions are less favorable, until 
the least favorable of all, in February, after which favorablness increases 
up to the climacteric opposition in August again. This is a cycle of 
changing proximities within a period of about fifteen years. 

In October, 1862, Lockyer saw a spot like a long train of clouds on Mars, 
and several days later Secchi saw a spot on Mars. And if that were 
signalling, it is a very meagre material upon which to suppose anything. And 
May 8-22, 1873 -- white spots on Mars. But, upon June 17, 1873, two months 
after nearest approach, but still in the period of opposition of Mars, there 
was either an extraordinary occurrence, or the extraordinariness is in our 
interpretation. See Rept B.A., 1874-272.(9) A luminous object came to this 
earth, and was seen and heard upon the night of June 17, 1873, to explode in 
the sky of Hungary, Austria, and Bohemia. In the words of various writers, 
termed according to their knowledge, the object was seen seemingly coming 
from Mars, or from "the red star in the south," where Mars was at the time. 
Our data were collected by Dr. Galle. The towns of Rybnik and Ratibor, Upper 
Silesia, are 15 miles apart.(10) Without parallax, this luminous thing was 
seen from these points "to emerge and separate itself from the disk of the 
planet Mars." It so happens that we have a definite observation from one of 
these towns. At Rybnik, Dr. Sage was looking at Mars, at the time. He saw 
the luminous object "apparently issue from the planet." There is another 
circumstance, and for its reception our credulity, or our enlightenment, has 
been prepared. If this thing did come from Mars, it came from the planet to 
the point where it exploded in about 5 seconds: from the point of the 
explosion, the sound travelled in several minutes. We have a description 
from Dr. Sage that indicates that a bolt of some kind, perhaps electric, did 
shoot from Mars, and that the planet quaked with the shock -- "Dr. Sage was 
looking attentively at the planet Mars, when he thus [101/102] saw the 
meteor apparently issue from it, and the planet appear as if it was breaking 
up and dividing into two parts." 

Some of the greatest surprises in commonplace experience are discoveries of 
the nearness of that which was supposed to be the inaccessibly remote. 




* * *



It seems that the moon is close to this earth, because of the phenomenon of 
"earthshine." The same appearance has been seen upon the planet Venus. If 
upon the moon, it is light reflecting from this earth and back to this 
earth, what is it upon Venus? It is "some unexplained optical illusion," 
says Newcomb, (Popular Astronomy, p. 296.(11) For a list of more than twenty 
observations upon this illumination of Venus, see Rept. B.A., 1873-404.(12) 
It is our expression that the phenomenon is "unexplained" because it does 
indicate that Venus is millions of miles closer to this earth than Venus 
"should" be. 

Unknown objects have been seen near Venus. There were more than thirty such 
observations in the eighteenth century, not relating to so many different 
periods, however. Our own earliest datum is Webb's observation, of May 22, 
1823. I know of only one astronomer who has supposed that these observations 
could relate to a Venusian satellite, pronouncedly visible sometimes, and 
then for many years being invisible: something else will have to be thought 
of. If these observations and others that we shall have, be accepted, they 
relate to unknown bulks that have, from outer space, gone to Venus, and have 
been in temporary suspension near the planet, even though the shade of Sir 
Isaac Newton would curdle at the suggestion. If, acceptably, from outer 
space, something could go to the planet Venus, one is not especially 
startled with the idea that something could sail out from the planet Venus -
- visit this earth, conceivably. 

In the Rept. B.A., 1852-8, 35, it is said that, early in the morning of 
Sept. 11, 1852, several persons at Four Oaks, Staffordshire, had seen, in 
the eastern sky, a luminous object.(13) It was first seen at 4.15 A.M. It 
appeared and disappeared several times, until 4.45 A.M., when it became 
finally invisible. Then, at almost the same place in the sky, Venus was 
seen, having risen above the eastern horizon. These persons sent the records 
of their [102/103] observations to Lord Wrottesley, an astronomer whose 
observatory was at Wolverhampton. There is published a letter from Lord 
Wrottesley, who says that at first he had thought that the suppositiously 
unknown object was Venus, with perhaps an extraordinary halo, but that he 
had received from one of the observers a diagram giving such a position 
relatively to the moon that he hesitated so to identify. It was in the 
period of nearest approach to this earth by Venus, and, since inferior 
conjunction, (July 20, 1852) Venus had been a "morning star." If this thing 
in the sky were not Venus, the circumstances are that an object came close 
to this earth, perhaps, and for a while was stationary, as if waiting for 
the planet Venus to appear above the eastern horizon, then disappearing, 
whether to sail to Venus or not. We think that perhaps this thing did come 
close to this earth, because it was, it seems, seen only in the local sky of 
Four Oaks. However, if, according to many of our data, professional 
astronomers have missed extraordinary appearances at reasonable hours, we 
can't conclude much from what was not reported by them, after 4 o'clock in 
the morning. I do not know whether this is the origin of the convention or 
not, but this is the first note I have upon the now standardized explanation 
that, when a luminous object is seen in the sky at the time of the nearest 
approach by Venus, it is Venus, attracting attention by her great 
brilliance, exciting persons, unversed in astronomic matters, into thinking 
that a strange object had visited this earth. When reports are definite as 
to motions of a seemingly sailing or exploring, luminous thing, astronomers 
say that it was a fire-balloon. 

In the Rept. B.A., 1856-54, it is said that, according to "Mrs. Ayling and 
friends," in a letter to Lord Wrottesley, a bright object had been seen in 
the sky of Petworth, Sussex, night of August 11, 1855.(14) According to the 
description, it rose from behind hills, in the distance, at half past eleven 
o'clock. It was a red body, or it was a red-appearing construction, because 
from it were projections like spokes of a wheel; or, they were "stationary" 
rays, in the words of the description. "Like a red moon, it rose slowly, and 
diminished slowly, remaining visible one hour and a half."(15) Upon August 
11, 1855, Venus was two weeks from primary greatest brilliance, inferior 
conjunction occurring upon Sept. 30. The [103/104] thing could not have been 
Venus, ascending in the sky, at this time of night. An astonishing thing, 
like a red moon, perhaps with spokes like a wheel's, might, if reported from 
nowhere else, be considered something that came from outer space so close to 
this earth that it was visible only in a local sky, except that it might 
have been visible in other places, and even half past eleven at night may be 
an unheard-of hour for astronomers, who specialize upon sunspots for a 
reason that is clearing up to us. Of course an ordinary fire-balloon could 
be extraordinarily described. 

June 8, 1868 -- I have not the exact time, but one does suspect that it was 
early in the evening -- an object that was reported from Radcliffe 
Observatory, Oxford. It looked like a comet, but inasmuch as it was reported 
only from Radcliffe, it may have been in the local sky of Oxford. It seemed 
to sail in the sky: it moved and changed its course. At first it was 
stationary; then it moved westward, then southward, then turning north, 
visible four minutes. See Eng. Mec., 7-351.(16) According to a correspondent 
to the Birmingham Gazette, May 28, 1868, there had been an extraordinary 
illumination upon Venus, some nights before: a red spot, visible for a few 
seconds, night of May 27.(17) In the issue of the Gazette, of June 1st, 
someone else writes that he saw this light appearing and disappearing upon 
Venus.(18) Upon March 15, Browning had seen something that looked like a 
little shaft of light from Venus (Eng. Mec., 40-130); and upon April 6, Webb 
had seen a similar appearance (Celestial Objects, p. 57).(19) 

At the time of the appearance at Oxford, Venus was in the period of nearest 
approach (inferior conjunction July 16, 1868). 

I think, myself, that there was one approximately great, wise astronomer. He 
was Tycho Brahé. For many years, he would not describe what he saw in the 
sky, because he considered it beneath his dignity to write a book.(20) The 
undignified, or more or less literary, or sometimes altogether literary, 
astronomers, who do write books, uncompromisingly say that when a luminous 
object is said to have moved to greater degree than could be considered 
illusory, in a local sky of this earth, it is a fire-balloon. It is not 
possible to find in the writings of astronomers who so explain, mention of 
the object that was seen by Coggia, night of August 1, 1871. It seems that 
this thing was not far away, and 104/105] did appear only in a local sky of 
this earth, and if it did come from outer space, how it could have "boarded" 
this earth, if this earth moves at a rate of 19 miles a second, or 1 mile a 
second, is so hard to explain that why Proctor and Hind, with their 
passionate itch for explaining, never took the matter up, I don't know. Upon 
Aug. 1, 1871, an unknown luminous object was seen in the sky of Marseilles, 
by Coggia (Comptes Rendus, 73-398).(21) According to description, it was a 
magnificent red object. It appeared at 10.43 P.M., and moved eastward, 
slowly, until 10.52.30. It stopped -- moved northward, and again, at 
10.59.30, was stationary. It turned eastward again, and, at 11.03.20, 
disappeared, or fell behind the horizon. Upon this night Venus was within 
three weeks of primary greatest brilliance, inferior conjunction occurring 
upon Sept. 25, 1871. [105]

CHAPTER THREE





ONE repeating mystery -- the mystery of the local sky. 

How, if this earth be a moving earth, could anything sail to, fall to, or in 
any other way reach this earth, without being smashed into fine particles by 
the impact? 

This earth is supposed to rip space at a rate of about 19 miles a second. 

Concepts smash when one tries to visualize such an accomplishment. 

Now, three times over, we shall have other aspects of this one mystery of 
the local sky. First we shall take up data upon seeming relation between a 
region of this earth that is subject to earthquakes, or so-called 
earthquakes, and appearances in the sky of this especial region, and the 
repeating falls of objects and substances from the local sky and nowhere 
else at the times. 

We have records of quakes that occurred at Irkutsk, Siberia, and of stones 
that fell from the sky to Irkutsk. Upon March 8, 1829, a severe quake, 
preceded by clattering sounds, was felt at Irkutsk. There was something in 
the sky. Dr. Erman, the geologist, was in Irkutsk, at the time. In the 
Report of the British Association, 1854-20, it is said that, in Dr. Erman's 
opinion, the sounds that preceded the quake were in the sky.(1) 

The situation at Comrie, Perthshire, is similar. A stone fell, May 17, 1830, 
in the "earthquake region" around Comrie. It fell at Perth, 22 miles from 
Comrie. See Fletcher's List, p. 100.(2) Upon Feb. 15, 1837, a black powder 
fell upon the Comrie region (Edin. New Phil. Jour., 31-293).(3) Oct. 12, 
1839 -- a quake at Comrie. According to the Rev. M. Walker, of Comrie, the 
sky, at the time, was "peculiarly strange and alarming, and appeared as if 
hung with sackcloth."(4) In Mallet's Catalog (Rept. B.A., 1854-290), it is 
said that, throughout the month of October, shocks were felt at Comrie, 
sometimes slight and sometimes severe -- "like distant thunder or reports of 
artillery" -- "the noise sometimes [106/107] seemed to be high in the air, 
and was often heard without any sensible shock."(5) Upon the 23rd of 
October, occurred the most violent quake in the whole series of phenomena at 
Comrie. See the Edin. New Phil. Jour., vol. 32.(6) All data in this 
publication were collected by David Milne. According to the Rev. M. Maxton, 
of Foulis Manse, ten miles from Comrie, rattling sounds were heard in the 
sky, preceding the shock that was felt. In vol. 33, page 373, of the 
Journal, someone who lived seven miles from Comrie is quoted: "In every 
case, I am inclined to say that the sound proceeded not from underground. 
The sound seemed high in the air."(7) Someone who lived at Gowrie, forty 
miles from Comrie, is quoted: "The most general opinion seems to be that the 
noise accompanying the concussion proceeded from above." See vol. 34, p.87: 
another impression of explosion overhead and concussion underneath: "The 
noises heard first seemed to be in the air, and the rumbling sound in the 
earth."(8) Milne's own conclusion -- "It is plain that there are, connected 
with the earthquake shocks, sounds both in the earth and in the air, which 
are distinct and separate." If, upon the 23rd of October, 1839, there was a 
tremendous shock, not of subterranean origin, but from a great explosion in 
the sky of Comrie, and if this be accepted, there will be concussions 
somewhere else. The "faults" of dogmas will open; there will be seismic 
phenomena in science. I have a feeling of a conventional survey of this 
Scottish sky: vista of a fair, blue, vacant expanse -- our suspicions daub 
the impression with black alarms -- but also do we project detonating 
stimulations into the fair and blue, but unoccupied and meaningless. One can 
not pass this single occurrence by, considering it only in itself: it is one 
of a long series of quakes of the earth at Comrie and phenomena in the sky 
at Comrie. We have stronger evidence than the mere supposition of many 
persons, in and near Comrie, that, upon Oct. 23, 1839, something had 
occurred in the sky, because sounds seemed to come from the sky. Milne says 
that clothes, bleaching on the grass, were entirely covered with black 
particles which presumably had fallen from the sky. The shocks were felt in 
November: in November, according to Milne, a powder like soot fell from the 
sky, upon Comrie and surrounding regions. In his report to the British 
Association, 1840, Milne, reviewing [107/108] the phenomena from the year 
1788, says: "Occasionally there was a fall of fine, black powder."(9) 

Jan. 8, 1840 -- sounds like cannonading, at Comrie, and a crackling sound in 
the air, according to some of the residents. Whether they were sounds of 
quakes of concussions that followed explosions, 247 occurrences, between 
Oct. 3, 1839, and Feb. 14, 1841, are listed in the Edin. New Phil. Jour., 
32-107.(10) It looks like a bombardment, and like most persistent 
bombardment -- from somewhere -- and the frequent fall from the sky of the 
débris of explosions. Feb. 18, 1841 -- a shock and a fall of discolored rain 
at Comrie (Edin. New Phil. Jour., 35-148).(11) See Roper's List of 
Earthquakes -- year after year, and the continuance of this seeming 
bombardment in one small part of the sky of this earth, though I can find 
records only of dates and no details.(12) However, I think I have found 
record of a fall from the sky of débris of an explosion, more substantial 
than finely powdered soot, at Crieff, which is several miles from Comrie. In 
the Amer. Jour. Sci., 2-28-275, Prof. Shepard tells a circumstantial story 
of an object that looked like a lump of slag, or cinders, reported to have 
fallen at Crieff.(13) Scientists had refused to accept the story, upon the 
grounds that the substance was not of "true meteoric material." Prof. 
Shepard went to Crieff and investigated. He gave his opinion that possibly 
the object did fall from the sky. The story he tells is that, upon the night 
of April 23, 1855, a young woman, in the home of Sir William Murray, 
Achterlyre House, Crieff, saw, or thought she saw, a luminous object 
falling, and picked it up, dropping it, because it was hot, or because she 
thought it was hot.(14) 

For a description, in a letter, presumably from Sir William Murray, or some 
member of his family, see Year Book of Facts, 1856-273.(15) It is said that 
about 12 fragments of scorious matter, hot and emitting a sulphurous odor, 
had fallen. 

In Ponton's Earthquakes, p. 118, it is said that, upon the 8th of October, 
1857, there had been, in Illinois, an earthquake, preceded by "a luminous 
appearance, described by some as a meteor and by others as vivid flashes of 
lightning."(16) Though felt in Illinois, the center of the disturbance was 
at St. Louis, Mo. One notes the misleading and the obscuring of such word- 
[108/109] ing: in all contemporaneous accounts there is no such 
indefiniteness as one description by "some" and another notion by "others." 
Something exploded terrifically in the sky, at St. Louis, and shook the 
ground "severely" or "violently," at 4.20 A.M., Oct. 8, 1857. According to 
Timbs' Year Book of Facts, 1858-271, "a blinding meteoric ball from the 
heavens" was seen.(17) "A large and brilliant meteor shot across the 
heavens" (St. Louis Intelligencer, Oct. 8). Of course the supposed 
earthquake was concussion from an explosion in the sky, but our own interest 
is in a series that is similar to others that we have recorded. According to 
the New York Times, Oct 12, a slight shock was said to have been felt four 
hours before the great concussion, and another three days before.(18) But 
see Milne's Catalog of Destructive Earthquakes -- not a mention of anything 
that would lead one away from safe and standardized suppositions.(19) See 
Bull. Seis. Soc. Amer., 3-68 -- here the "meteor" is mentioned, but there is 
no mention of the preceding concussions.(20) Time after time, in a period of 
about three days, concussions were felt in and around St. Louis. One of 
these concussions, with its "sound like thunder or the roar of artillery" 
(New York Times, Oct. 8), was from an explosion in the sky. If the others 
were of the same origin -- how could detonating meteors so repeat in one 
small local sky, and nowhere else, if this earth be a moving body? If it be 
said that only by coincidence did a meteor explode over a region where there 
had been other quakes, here is the question: 

How many times can we accept that explanation as to similar series? 




* * *



In the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, 19-144, a 
correspondent writes that, in Herefordshire, Sept. 24, 1854, upon a day that 
was "perfectly still, sky cloudless," he had heard sounds like the 
discharges of heavy artillery, at intervals of about two minutes, continuing 
several hours.(21) Again the "mystery of the local sky" -- if these sounds 
did come from the sky. We have no data for thinking that they did. 

In the London Times, Nov. 9, 1858, a correspondent writes that, in 
Cardiganshire, Wales, he had, in the autumn of 1855, often heard sounds like 
the discharges of heavy artillery, two or [109/110] three reports rapidly, 
and then an interval of perhaps 20 minutes, also with long intervals, 
sometimes of days and sometimes of weeks, continuing throughout the winter 
of 1855-56.(22) Upon the 3rd of November, 1858, he had heard the sounds 
again, repeatedly, and louder than they had been three years before. In the 
Times, Nov. 12, someone else says that, at Dolgelly, he, too, had heard the 
"mysterious phenomenon," on the 3rd of November.(23) Someone else -- that, 
upon Oct. 13, he had heard the sounds at Swansea.(24) "The reports, as if of 
heavy artillery, came from the west, succeeding each other at apparently 
regular intervals, during the greater part of the afternoon of that day. My 
impression was that sounds might have proceeded from practicing at Milford, 
but I ascertained, the following day, that there had been no firing of any 
kind there." Correspondent to the Times, November 20 -- that, with little 
doubt, the sounds were from artillery practice at Milford.(25) He does not 
mention the investigation as to the sounds of Oct. 13, but says that there 
had been cannon-firing, upon Nov. 3rd, at Milford. Times, Dec. 1 -- that 
most of the sounds could be accounted for as sounds of blasting in 
quarries.(26) Daily News, Nov. 16 -- that similar sounds had been heard, in 
1848, in New Zealand, and were results of volcanic action.(27) Standard, 
Nov. 16 -- that the "mysterious noise" must have been from Devonport, where 
a sunken rock had been blown up.(28) So, with at least variety these sounds 
were explained. But we learn that the series began before October 13. Upon 
the evening of Sept. 28, in the Dartmoor District, at Crediton, a rumbling 
sound was heard. It was not supposed to be an earthquake, because no 
vibration of the ground was felt. It was thought that there had been an 
explosion of gunpowder. But there had been no such terrestrial explosion. 
About an hour later another explosive sound was heard. It was like all the 
other sounds, and in one place was thought to be distant cannonading -- 
terrestrial cannonading. See Quar. Jour. Geolog. Soc. of London, vol. 
15.(29) 

Somewhere near Barisal, Bengal, were occurring just such sounds as the 
sounds of Cardiganshire, which were like the sounds of Melida. In the Proc. 
Asiatic Soc. of Bengal, Nov. 1870, are published letters upon the Barisal 
Guns.(30) One writer says that the sounds were probably booming of the surf. 
Someone else [110/111] points out that the sounds, usually described as 
"explosive," were heard too far inland to be traced to such origin. A clear, 
calm day, in December, 1871 -- in Nature, 53-197, Mr. G.B. Scott writes 
that, in Bengal, he had heard "a dull, muffled boom as if of distant cannon" 
-- single detonations, and then two or three in quicker succession.(31) 

In the London Times, Jan. 20, 1860, several correspondents write as to a 
sound "resembling the discharge of a gun high in the air" that was heard 
near Reading, Berkshire, England, Jan. 17, 1860.(32) See the Times, Jan. 
24th.(33) To say that a meteor had exploded would, at present, well enough 
account for this phenomenon.(34) 

Sounds like those that were heard in Herefordshire, Sept. 24, 1854, were 
heard later. In the English Mechanic, 100-279, it is said that, upon Nov. 9, 
1862, the Rev. T. Webb, the astronomer, of Hardwicke, fifteen miles west of 
Hereford, heard sounds that he attributed to gunfire at Milford Haven, about 
85 miles from Hardwicke.(35) Upon Aug. 1, 1865, Mr. Webb saw flashes upon 
the horizon, at Hardwicke, and attributed them to gunfire at Tenby, upon 
occasion of a visit by Prince Arthur. Tenby, too, is about 85 miles from 
Hardwicke. There were other phenomena in a region centering around Hereford 
and Worcester. Upon Oct. 6, 1863, there was a disturbance that is now listed 
as an earthquake; but in the London newspapers so many reports upon this 
occurrence state that a great explosion had been thought to occur, and that 
the quake was supposed to be an earthquake of subterranean origin only after 
no terrestrial explosion could be heard of, that the phenomenon is of 
questionable origin. There was a similar concussion in about the same 
region, Oct. 30, 1868. Again the shock was widely attributed to a great 
explosion, perhaps in London, and again was supposed to have been an 
earthquake when no terrestrial explosion could be heard of.

Arcana of Science, 1829-196:(36) 

That, near Mhow, India, Feb. 27, 1827, fell a stone "perfectly similar" to 
the stone that fell near Allahabad, in 1802, and a stone that fell near 
Mooradabad, in 1808. These towns are in the Northwestern Provinces of India. 
[111/112] 

I have looked at specimens of these stones, and in my view they are similar. 
They are of brownish rock, streaked and spotted with a darker brown. A stone 
that fell at Chandakopur, in the same general region, June 6, 1838, is like 
them. All are as much alike as "erratics" that, because they are alike, 
geologists ascribe to the same derivation, stationary relatively to the 
places in which they are found. 

It seems acceptable that, upon July 15 and 17, 1822, and then upon a later 
date, unknown seeds fell from the sky to this earth.(37) If these seeds did 
come from some other world, there is another mystery as well as that of 
repetition in a local sky of this earth. How could a volume of seeds remain 
in one aggregation; how could the seeds be otherwise than scattered from 
Norway to Patagonia, if they met in space this earth, and if this earth be 
rushing through space at a rate of 19 miles a second? It may be that the 
seeds of 1822 fell again. According to Kaemtz (Meteorology, p. 465) 
yellowish brown corpuscles, some round, a few cylindrical, were found upon 
the ground, June, 1830, near Griesau, Silesia.(38) Kaemtz says that they 
were tubercules from roots of a well-known Silesian plant -- stalk of the 
plant dries up; heavy rain raises these tubercules to the ground -- persons 
of a low order of mentality think that the things had fallen from the sky. 
Upon the night of March 24-25, 1852, a great quantity of seeds did fall from 
the sky, in Prussia, in Heinsberg, Erkelenz, and Juliers, according to M. 
Schwann, of the University of Liége, in a communication to the Belgian 
Academy of Science (La Belgique Horticole, 2-319).(39) 

In Comptes Rendus, 5-549, is Dr. Wartmann's account of water that fell from 
the sky, at Geneva.(40) At nine o'clock, morning of Aug. 9, 1837, there were 
clouds upon the horizon, but the zenith was clear. It is not remarkable that 
a little rain should fall now and then from a clear sky: we shall see 
wherein this account is remarkable. Large drops of warm water fell in such 
abundance that people were driven to shelter. The fall continued several 
minutes and then stopped. But then, several times during an hour, more of 
this warm water fell from the sky. Year Book of Facts, 1839-262 -- that upon 
May 31, 1838, lukewarm water in large drops fell from the sky, at 
Geneva.(41) Comptes Rendus, [112/113] 15-290 -- no wind and not a cloud in 
the sky -- at 10 o'clock, morning of May 11, 1842, warm water fell from the 
sky at Geneva, for about six minutes; five hours later, still no wind and no 
clouds, again fell warm water, in large drops; falling intermittently for 
several minutes.(42) 

In Comptes Rendus, 85-681, is noted a succession of falls of stones in 
Russia: June 12, 1863, at Buschof, Courland; Aug. 8, 1863, at Pillitsfer, 
Livonia; April 12, 1864, at Nerft, Courland.(43) Also -- see Fletcher's List 
-- a stone that fell at Dolgovdi, Volhynia, Russia, June 26, 1864.(44) I 
have looked at specimens of all four of these stones, and have found them 
all very much alike, but not of uncommon meteoric material: all gray stones, 
but Pillitsfer is darker than the others, and in a polished specimen of 
Nerft, brownish specks are visible. 

In the Birmingham Daily Post, June 14, 1858, Dr. C. Mansfield Ingleby, a 
meteorologist, writes: "During the storm on Saturday (12th) morning, 
Birmingham was visited by a shower of aerolites. Many hundreds of thousands 
must have fallen, some of the streets being strewn with them."(45) Someone 
else writes than many pounds of the stones had been gathered from awnings, 
and that they had damaged greenhouses, in the suburbs.(46) In the Post, of 
the 15th, someone else writes that, according to his microscopic 
examinations, the supposed aerolites were only bits of the Rowley ragstone, 
with which Birmingham was paved, which had been washed loose by the 
rain.(47) It is not often that sentiment is brought into meteorology, but in 
the Report of the British Association, 1864-37, Dr. Phipson explains the 
occurrence meteorologically, and with an unconscious tenderness.(48) He says 
that the stones did fall from the sky, but that they had been carried in a 
whirlwind from Rowley, some miles from Birmingham. So we are to 
sentimentalize over the stones in Rowley that had been torn, by unfeeling 
paviers, from their companions of geologic ages, and exiled to the pavements 
of Birmingham, and then some of these little bereft companions, rising in a 
whirlwind and travelling, unerringly, if not miraculously, to rejoin the 
exiles. More dark companions. It is said that they were little black stones. 

They fell again from the sky, two years later. In La Science Pour Tous, June 
19, 1860, it is said that, according to the Wolver- [113/114] hampton 
Advertiser, a great number of little black stones had fallen, in a violent 
storm, at Wolverhampton.(49) According to all records findable by me no such 
stones have ever fallen anywhere in Great Britain, except at Birmingham and 
Wolverhampton, which is 13 miles from Birmingham. 

Eight years after the second occurrence, they fell again. English Mechanic, 
July 31, 1868 -- that stones "similar to, if not identical with the well-
known Rowley ragstones" had fallen in Birmingham, having probably been 
carried from Rowley, in a whirlwind.(50) 

We were pleased with Dr. Phipson's story, but to tell of more of the little 
dark companions rising in a whirlwind and going unerringly from Rowley to 
rejoin exiles in Birmingham is overdoing. That's not sentiment: that's 
mawkishness. 

In the Birmingham Daily Post, May 30, 1868, is published a letter from 
Thomas Plant, a writer and lecturer upon meteorological subjects. Mr. Plant 
says, I think, that for one hour, morning of May 29, 1868, stones fell, in 
Birmingham, from the sky. His words may be interpretable in some other way, 
but it does not matter: the repeating falls are indication enough of what 
we're trying to find out -- "From nine to ten, meteoric stones fell in 
immense quantities in various parts of town." "They resembled, in shape, 
broken pieces of Rowley ragstone...in every respect they were like the 
stones that fell in 1858."(51) In the Post, June 1, Mr. Plant says that the 
stones of 1858 did fall from the sky, and were not fragments washed out of 
the pavement by rain, because many pounds of them had been gathered from a 
platform that was 20 feet above the ground. 

It may be that for days before and after May 29, 1868, occasional stones 
fell from some unknown region stationary above Birmingham. In the Post, June 
2, a correspondent writes that, upon the first of June, his niece, while 
walking in a field, was struck by a stone that injured her hand severely. He 
thinks that the stone had been thrown by some unknown person. In the Post, 
June 4, someone else writes that his wife, while walking down a lane, upon 
May 24th, had been cut on the head by a stone. He attributes this injury to 
stone-throwing by boys, but does not say that anyone had been seen to throw 
the stone. [114/115] 

Symons' Met. Mag., 4-137:(52) 

That, according to the Birmingham Gazette, a great number of small, black 
stones had been found in the streets of Wolverhampton, May 25, 1869, after a 
severe storm. It is said that the stones were precisely like those that had 
fallen in Birmingham, the year before, and resembled Rowley ragstone 
outwardly, but had a different appearance when broken. [115]

CHAPTER FOUR





UPON page 287, Popular Astronomy, Newcomb says that it is beyond all "moral 
probability" that unknown worlds should exist in such numbers as have been 
reported, and should be seen crossing the solar disc only by amateur 
observers and not by skilled astronomers.(1) 

Most of our instances are reports by some of the best-known astronomers. 

Newcomb says that for fifty years prior to his time of writing (edition of 
1878) the sun had been studied by such men as Schwabe, Carrington, Secchi, 
and Spörer, and that they had never seen unknown bodies cross the sun -- 

Aug. 30, 1863 -- an unknown body was seen by Spörer to cross the sun (Webb, 
Celestial Objects, p. 45).(2) 

Sept. 1, 1859 -- two star-like objects that were seen by Carrington to cross 
the sun (Monthly Notices, 20-13, 15, 88).(3) 

Things that have crossed the sun, July 31, 1826, and May 26, 1828 -- see 
Comptes Rendus, 83-623, and Webb's Celestial Objects, p. 40.(4) From Sept. 6 
to Nov. 1, 1831, an unknown luminous object was seen every cloudless night, 
at Geneva, by Dr. Wartmann and his assistants (Comptes Rendus, 2-307).(5) It 
was reported from nowhere else. What all the other astronomers were doing, 
Sept.-Oct., 1831, is one of the mysteries that we shall not solve. An 
unknown, luminous object that was seen, from May 11 to May 14, 1835, by 
Cacciatore, the Sicilian astronomer (Amer. Jour. Sci., 31-158).(6) Two 
unknowns that according to Pastorff, crossed the sun, Nov. 1, 1836, and Feb. 
16, 1837 (An. Sci. Disc., 1860-410) -- De Vico's unknown, July 12, 1837, 
(Observatory, 2-424) -- observation by De Cuppis, Oct. 2, 1839 (C.R.,, 83-
314) -- by Scott and Wray, last of June, 1847; by Schmidt, Oct. 11, 1847 
(C.R., 83-623) -- two dark bodies that were seen, Feb. 5, 1849, by Brown, of 
Deal (Rec. Sci., 1-138) -- object watched by [116/117] Sidebotham, half an 
hour, March 12, 1849, crossing the sun, (C.R., 83-622) -- Schmidt's unknown, 
Oct. 14, 1849 (Observatory, 3-137) -- and an object that was watched, four 
nights in October, 1850, by James Ferguson, of the Washington 
Observatory.(7) Mr. Hind believed this object to be a Trans-Neptunian 
planet, and calculated for it a period of 1,600 years. Mr. Hind was a great 
astronomer, and he miscalculated magnificently: this floating island of 
space was not seen again (Smithson. Miscell. Cols., 20-20).(8) 

About May 30, 1853 -- a black point that was seen against the sun, by 
Jaennicke (Cosmos, 20-64).(9) 

A procession -- in the Rept. B.A., 1855-94, R.P. Greg says that, upon May 
22, 1854, a friend of his saw, near Mercury, an object equal in size to the 
planet itself, and behind it an elongated object, and behind that something 
else, smaller and round.(10) 

June 11, 1855 -- a dark body of such size that it was seen, without 
telescopes, by Ritter and Schmidt, crossing the sun (Observatory, 3-
137).(11) Sept. 12, 1857 -- Ohrt's unknown world; seemed to be about the 
size of Mercury (C.R., 83-623) -- Aug. 1, 1858 -- unknown world reported by 
Wilson, of Manchester (Astro. Reg., 9-287).(12) 

I am not listing all the unknowns of a period; perhaps the object reported 
by John H. Tice, of St. Louis, Mo., Sept. 15, 1859, should not be included; 
Mr. Tice was said not to be trustworthy -- but who has any way of 
knowing?(13) However, I am listing enough of these observations to make me 
feel like a translated European of some centuries ago, relatively to a wider 
existence -- lands that may be the San Salvadors, Greenlands, Madagascars, 
Cubas, Australias of extra-geography, all of them said to have crossed the 
sun, whereas the sun may have moved behind some of them -- 

Jan. 29, 1860 -- unknown object, of planetary size, reported from London, by 
Russell and three other observers (Nature, 15-505).(14) Summer of 1860 -- 
see Sci. Amer., 35-340, for an account, by Richard Covington, of an object, 
that without a telescope, he saw crossing the sun.(15) An unknown world, 
reported by Loomis, of Manchester, March 20, 1862 (Monthly Notices, 22-232) 
-- a newspaper account of an object that was seen crossing the sun, 
[117/118] Feb. 12, 1864, [b]y Samuel Beswick, of New York (Astro. Reg., 2-
161) -- unknown that was seen March 8, 1865, at Constantinople (L'Ann. Sci., 
1865-16) -- unknown "cometic objects" that were seen, November 4, 9, and 18, 
1865 (Monthly Notices, 26-242).(16) 

Most of these unknowns were seen in the daytime. Several reflections arise. 
How can there be stationary regions over Irkutsk, Comrie, and Birmingham, 
and never obscure the stars -- or never be seen to obscure the stars? A 
heresy that seems too radical for me is that they may be beyond nearby 
stars. A more reasonable idea is that if nightwatchmen and policemen and 
other persons who do stay awake nights, should be given telescopes, 
something might be found out. Something else that one thinks of is that, if 
so many unknowns have been seen crossing the sun, or crossed by the sun, 
others not so revealed must exist in great numbers, and that instead of 
being virtually blank, space must be archipelagoic. 

Something that was seen at night; observer not an astronomer -- 

Nov. 6, 1866 -- an account, in the London Times, Jan. 2, 1867, by Senor De 
Fonblanque, of the British Consulate, at Carthegena, U.S. Colombia, of a 
luminous object that moved in the sky.(17) "It was of the magnitude, color, 
and brilliance of a ship's red light, as seen at a distance of 200 yards." 
The object was visible three minutes, and then disappeared behind buildings. 
De Fonblanque went to an open space to look for it, but did not see it 
again. [118]

revolutions, plus one half, were required, unless Vulcan were to be seen

CHAPTER FIVE





IF we could stop to sing, instead of everlastingly noting vol. this and p. 
that, we could have the material of sagas -- of the bathers in the sun, 
which may be neither intolerably hot nor too uncomfortably cold; and of the 
hermit who floats across the moon; of heroes and the hairy monsters of the 
sky. I should stand in public places and sing our data -- sagas of parades 
and explorations and massacres in the sky -- having a busy band of 
accompanists, who set off fireworks, and send up balloons, and fire off 
explosives at regular intervals -- extra-geographic songs of boiling lakes 
and floating islands -- extra-sociologic metres that express the tramp of 
space-armies upon interplanetary paths covered with little black pebbles -- 
biologic epics of the clouds of mammoths and horses and antelopes that once 
upon a time fell from the sky upon the northern coast of Siberia -- 

Song that interprets the perpendicular white streaks in the repeating 
mirages at Youghal -- the rhythmic walruses of space that hang on by their 
tusks to the edges of space-islands, sometimes making stars variable as they 
swing in cosmic undulations -- so a round space-island with its border of 
gleaming tusks, and we frighten children with the song of an ogre's head, 
with wide-open mouth all around it -- fairy lands of the little moon, and 
the tiny civilizations in rocky cups that are sometimes drained to their 
slums by the wide-mouthed ogres. The Maelstrom of Everlasting Catastrophe 
that overhangs Genoa, Italy -- and twines its currents around a living 
island. The ground underneath quakes with the struggle -- then the fall of 
blood -- and the fall of blood -- three days the fall of blood from the 
broken red brooks of a living island whose mutilations are scenery -- 

But after all, it may be better that we go back to Rept. B.A. -- see the 
vol. for 1849, p. 46 -- a stream of black objects, crossing the sun, 
watched, at Naples, May 11, 1845, by Capocci and other astronomers -- things 
that may have been seeds.(1) [119/120] 

A great number of red points in the sky of Urrugne, July 9, 1853 (An. Soc. 
Met. de France, 1853-227).(2) Astro. Reg., 5-179 -- C.L. Prince, of 
Uckfield, writes that, upon June 11, 1867, he saw objects crossing the field 
of his telescope.(3) They were seeds, in his opinion. 

Birmingham Daily Post, May 31, 1867: 

Mr. Bird, the astronomer, writes that, about 11 A.M., May 30, he saw unknown 
forms in the sky. In his telescope, which was focused upon them and upon the 
planet Venus, they appeared to be twice the size of Venus. They were far 
away, according to focus; also, it may be accepted that they were far away 
because an occasional cloud passed between them and this earth. They did not 
move like objects carried in the wind: all did not move in the same 
direction, and they moved at different speeds. 

"All of them seemed to have hairy appendages, and in many cases a distinct 
tail followed the object and was highly luminous." 

Flashes that have been seen in the sky -- and they're from a living island 
that wags his luminous peninsula. Hair-like substances that have fallen to 
this earth -- a meadow has been shorn from a monster's mane. My animation is 
the notion that it is better to think in tentative hysteria of pairs of vast 
things, travelling like a North and South America through the sky, perhaps 
one biting the other with its Gulf of Mexico, than to go on thinking that 
all things that so move in the sky are seeds, whereas all things that swim 
in the sea are not sardines. 

In the Post, June 3, 1867, Mr. W.H. Wood writes that the objects were 
probably seeds. Post, June 5 -- Mr. Bird says that the objects were not 
seeds. "My intention was simply to describe what was seen, and the 
appearance was certainly that of meteors." He saves himself, in the annals 
of extra-geography -- "whether they were meteors of the ordinary 
acceptation, is another matter." 

And the planet Venus, and her veil that is dotted with blue-fringed cupids -
- in the Astronomical Register, 7-138, a correspondent writes, from 
Northampton, that, upon May 2, 1869, he was looking at Venus, and saw a host 
of shining objects, not uniform in size.(4) He thinks that it is unlikely 
that so early in the spring could these objects be seeds. He watched them 
about an hour and twenty minutes -- "many of the larger ones were fringed 
[120/121] on one side; the fringe appearing somewhat bluish." Or that it is 
better even to sentimentalize than to go on stupidly thinking that all such 
things in the sky are seeds, whereas all things in the sea are not the 
economically adjusting little forms without which critics of underground 
traffic in New York probably could not express themselves -- the planet 
Venus -- she approaches this lordly earth -- the blue-fringed ecstasies that 
suffuse her skies. 

With the phenomena of Aug. 7, 1869, I suspect that the "phantom soldiers" 
that have been seen in the sky, may have been reflections from, or mirages 
of, things or beings that march, in military formations, in space. In 
Popular Astronomy, 3-159, Prof. Swift writes that, at Mattoon, Ill., during 
the eclipse of the sun, Aug. 7, 1869, he had seen, crossing the moon, 
objects that he thought were seeds.(5) If they were seeds, also there 
happened to be seeds in the sky of Ottumwa, Iowa: here, crossing the visible 
part of the sun, twenty minutes before totality of the eclipse, Prof. Himes 
and Prof. Zentmayer saw objects that marched, or that moved, in straight, 
parallel lines (Les Mondes, 21-241).(6) In the Jour. Frank. Inst., 3-58-214, 
it is said that some of these objects moved in one direction across the 
moon, and that others moved in another direction across another part of the 
moon, each division moving in parallel lines.(7) If these things were seeds, 
also there happened to be seeds in the sky, at Shelleyville, Kentucky. Here 
were seen, by Prof. Winlock, Alvan Clark Jr., and George W. Dean, things 
that moved across the moon, during the eclipse, in parallel, straight lines 
(Pop. Astro., 2-332).(8) 

Whatever these things may have been, I offer another datum indicating that 
the moon is nearby: that these objects probably were not, by coincidence, 
things in three widely separated skies, parallelness giving them identity in 
two of the observations; and, if seen, without parallax, from places so far 
apart, against the moon, were close to the moon; that observation of such 
detail would be unlikely if they were near a satellite 240,000 miles away -- 
unless, of course, they were mountain-sized. 

It may be that out from two floating islands of space, two processions had 
marched across the moon. Observatory, 3-137 -- that at St. Paul's Junction, 
Iowa, four persons had seen, without telescopes, a shining object close to 
the sun and moon, apparently; [121/122] that, with a telescope, another 
person had seen another large object, crescentically illumined, farther from 
the sun and moon in eclipse.(9) See Nature, 18-663, and Astro. Reg., 7-
227.(10) 

I have many data upon the fall of organic matter from the sky. Because of my 
familiarity with many records, it seems no more incredible that up in the 
seemingly unoccupied sky there should be hosts of living things than that 
seemingly blank of the ocean should swarm with life. I have many notes upon 
a phosphorescence, or electric condition of things that fall from the sky, 
for instance the highly luminous stones of Dhurmsulla, which were intensely 
cold -- 

Amer. Jour. Sci., 2-28-270:(11) 

It is said that, according to investigations by Prof. Shepard, a luminous 
substance was seen falling slowly, by Sparkman R. Scriven, a young man of 
seventeen, at his home, in Charleston, S.C., Nov. 16, 1857. It is said that 
the young man saw a fiery, red ball, the size and shape of an orange, strike 
a fence, breaking, and disappearing. Where this object had struck the fence, 
was found "a small bristling mass of black fibers." According to Prof. 
Shepard, it was "a confused aggregate of short clippings of the finest black 
hair, varying in length from one tenth to one third of an inch." Prof. 
Shepard says that this substance was not organic. It seems to me that he 
said this only because of the coercions of his era. My reason for so 
thinking is that he wrote that when he analyzed these hairs they burned 
away, leaving grayish skeletons, and that they were "composed in part of 
carbon." and burned with an odor "most nearly bituminous." 

For full details of the following circumstances, see Comptes Rendus, 13-215, 
and Rept. B.A., 1854-302:(12) 

Feb. 17, 1841 -- the fall, at Genoa, Italy, of a red substance from the sky 
-- another fall upon the 18th -- a slight quake, at 5 P.M., Feb. 18th -- 
another quake, six hours later -- fall of more of the red substance, upon 
the 19th. Some of this substance was collected and analyzed by M. Canobbia, 
of Genoa. He says it was oily and red. [122]

CHAPTER SIX





IN a pamphlet entitled Wonderful Phenomena by Curtis Eli, is the report of 
an occurrence, or of an alleged occurrence, that was investigated by Mr. 
Addison A. Sawin, a spiritualist.(1) He interpreted in the only way that I 
know of, and that is the psychochemic process of combining new data with 
preconceptions with which they seem to have affinity. It is said that, at 
Warwick, Canada West (Ontario), Oct. 3, 1843, somebody named Charles Cooper 
heard a rumbling sound in the sky, and saw a cloud, under which were three 
human forms, "perfectly white," sailing through the air above him, little 
higher than the tree-tops. It is said that the beings were angels. They were 
male angels. That is orthodox. The angels wafted through the air, but 
without motions of their own, and an interesting observation is that they 
seemed to have belts around their bodies -- as if they had been let down 
from a vessel above, though this poor notion is not suggested in the 
pamphlet. They "moaned." Cooper called to some men who were laboring in 
another field, and they saw the cloud, but did not see the forms of living 
beings under it. It is said that a boy had seen the beings in the air, "side 
by side, making a loud and mournful noise." Another person, who lived six 
miles away, is quoted: "He saw the clouds and the persons, and heard the 
sounds." Mr. Sawin quotes others, who had seen "a very remarkable cloud," 
and had heard the sounds, but had not seen the angels. He ends up: "Yours, 
in the glorious hope of the resurrection of the soul." The gloriousness of 
it is an inverse function of the dolefulness of it: Sunday Schools will not 
take kindly to the doctrine -- be good and you will moan forever. One 
supposes that the glorious hope colored the whole investigation. 

Some day I shall publish data that lead me to suspect that many appearances 
upon this earth that were once upon a time interpreted by theologians and 
demonologists, but are now supposed to be the subject-matter of psychic 
research, were beings and objects that [123/124] visited this earth, not 
from a spiritual existence, but from outer space. That extra-geographic 
conditions may be spiritual, or of highly attenuated matter, is not my 
present notion, though that, too, may be some day accepted. Of course all 
these data suffer, in one way, about as much distortion as they would in 
other ways, if they had been reported by astronomers or meteorologists. As 
to all the material in this chapter, I take the position that perhaps there 
were appearances in the sky, and perhaps they were revelations of, or 
mirages from, unknown regions and conditions of outer space, and spectacles 
of relatively nearby inhabited lands, and of space-travellers, but that all 
reports upon them were products of the assimilating of the unknown with 
figures and figments of the nearest familiar similarities. Another position 
of mine that will be found well-taken is that, no matter what my own 
interpretations or acceptances may be, they will compare favorably, so far 
as rationality is concerned, with orthodox explanations. There have been 
many assertions that "phantom soldiers" have been seen in the sky. For the 
orthodox explanation of the physicists, see David Brewster's Letters on 
Natural Magic, p. 125: a review of the phenomenon of June 23, 1744; that, 
according to 27 witnesses, some of whom gave sworn testimony before a 
magistrate, whether that should be mentioned or not, troops of aërial 
soldiers had been seen, in Scotland, on and over a mountain, remaining 
visible two hours and then disappearing because of darkness.(2) In James 
Clarke's Survey of the Lakes (fol. 1789) is an account in the words of one 
of the witnesses.(3) See Notes and Queries, 1-7-304. Brewster says that the 
scene must have been a mirage of British troops, who, in anticipation of the 
rebellion of 1745, were secretly manoeuvring upon the other side of the 
mountain.(4) With a talent for clear-seeing, for which we are notable, 
except when it comes to some of our own explanations, we almost instantly 
recognize that, to keep a secret from persons living upon one side of a 
mountain, it is a very sensible idea to go and manoeuvre upon the other side 
of the mountain; but then how to keep the secret, in a thickly populated 
country like Scotland, from persons living upon that other side of the 
mountain -- however there never has been an explanation that did not itself 
have to be explained. 

Or the "phantom soldiers" that were seen at Ujest, Silesia, in [124/125] 
1785 -- see Parish's Hallucination and Illusions, p. 309.(5) Parish finds 
that at the time of this spectacle, there were soldiers, of this earth, 
marching near Ujest; so he explains that the "phantom soldiers" were mirages 
of them. They were marching in the funeral procession of General von Cosel. 
But some time later they were seen again, at Ujest -- and the General had 
been dead and buried several days, and his funeral procession disbanded -- 
and if a refraction can survive independently of its primary, so may a 
shadow, and anybody may take a walk where he went a week before, and see 
some of his shadows still wandering around without him. The great neglect of 
these explainers is in not accounting for an astonishing preference for, or 
specialization in, marching soldiers, by mirages. But if often there be, in 
the sky, things or beings that move in parallel lines, and, if their 
betrayals be not mirages, but their shadows cast down upon the haze of this 
earth, or Brocken spectres, such frequency, or seeming specialization, might 
be accounted for. 

Sept. 27, 1846 -- a city in the sky of Liverpool (Rept. B.A., 1847-39).(6) 
The apparition is said to have been a mirage of the city of Edinburgh. This 
"identification" seems to have been the product of suggestion: at the time a 
panorama of Edinburgh was upon exhibition in Liverpool. 

Summer of 1847 -- see Flammarion's The Atmosphere, p. 160 -- story told by 
M. Grellois: that he was travelling between Ghelma and Bône, when he saw to 
the east of Bône, upon a gently sloping hill, "a vast and beautiful city, 
adorned with monuments, domes, and steeples."(7) There was no resemblance to 
any city known to M. Grellois. 

In the Bull. Soc. Astro. de France, 21-180, is an account of a spectacle 
that, according to 20 witnesses, was seen for two hours in the sky of Vienne 
dans le Dauphiné, May 3, 1848.(8) A city -- and an army, in the sky. One 
supposes that a Brewster would say that nearby was a terrestrial city, with 
troops manoeuvering near it. But also vast lions were seen in the sky -- and 
that is enough to discourage any Brewster. Four months later, according to 
the London Times, Sept. 13, 1848, a still more discouraging -- or perhaps 
stimulating -- spectacle was, or was not, seen in Scotland.(9) Afternoon of 
Sept. 9, 1848 -- Quigley's Point, Lough Foyle, [125/126] Scotland -- the sky 
turned dark. It seemed to open. The opening looked reddish, and in the 
reddish area, appeared a regiment of soldiers. Then came appearances that 
looked like war vessels under full sail, then "a man and a woman and a swan 
and a peahen." The "opening" closed, and that was the last of this shocking 
or ridiculous mixture that nobody but myself would record as being worth 
thinking about. 

"Phantom soldiers" that were seen in the sky, near Banmouth, Dec. 14, 1850 
(Rept. B.A., 1852-30).(10) 

"Phantom soldiers" that were seen at Buderich, Jan. 22, 1854 (Notes and 
Queries, 1-9-267).(11) 

"Phantom soldiers" that were seen by Lord Roberts of Kandahar (Forty-One 
Years in India, 30th ed., 218), at Mohan, Feb. 25, 1858.(12) It is either 
that Lord Roberts saw indistinctly, and described in terms of the familiar 
to him, or that we are set back in our own notions. According to him, the 
figures wore Hindoo costumes. 

Extra-geography -- its vistas and opening and fields -- and the Thoreaus 
that are upon this earth, but undeveloped, because they cannot find their 
ponds. A lonely thing and its pond, afloat in space -- they crossed the 
moon. In Cosmos, n.s., 11-200, it is said that, night of July 7, 1857, two 
persons of Chambon had seen forms crossing the moon -- something like a 
human being followed by a pond.(13) 

"Phantom soldiers" that were seen, about the year 1860, at Paderborn, 
Westphalia (Crowe, The Night-Side of Nature, p. 416).(14) [126]

CHAPTER SEVEN





WE attempt to co-ordinate various streaks of data, all of which signify to 
us that, external to this earth, and in relation with, or relatable to, this 
earth are lands and lives and a generality of conditions that make of the 
whole, supposed solar system one globule of circumstances like terrestrial 
circumstances. Our expressions are in physical terms, though in outer space 
there may be phenomena known as psychic phenomena, because of the solid 
substances and objects that have fallen from the sky to this earth, similar 
to, but sometimes not identified with, known objects and substances upon 
this earth. Opposing us is the more or less well-established conventional 
doctrine that has spun like a cocoon around mind upon this earth, shutting 
off research, and stifling even speculation, shelling away all data of 
relations and relatability with external existences, a doctrine that, in its 
various explanations and disregards and denials, is unified in one 
expression of Exclusionism. 

An unknown vegetable substance falls from the sky. The datum is buried: it 
may sprout some day. 

The earth quakes. A luminous object is seen in the sky. Substance falls from 
the unknown. But the event is cataloged with subterranean earthquakes. 

All conventional explanation and all conventional disregards and denials 
have Exclusionism in common. The unity is so marked, all writings in the 
past are so definitely in agreement, that I now think of a general era that 
is, by Exclusionism, as distinctly characterized as ever was the 
Carboniferous Era. 

A pregnant woman stands near Niagara Falls. There are sounds, and they are 
vast circumstances; but the cells of an unborn being respond, or vibrate, 
only as they do to disturbances in their own little environment. Horizons 
pour into a gulf, and thunder rolls upward: embryonic consciousness is no 
more than [127/128] to slight perturbations of maternal indigestion. It is 
Exclusionism. 

Stones fall from the sky. To the same part of this earth, they fall again. 
They fall again. They fall from the same region that, relatively to this 
part of the earth's surface, is stationary. But to say this leads to the 
suspicion that it is this earth that is stationary. To think that is to beat 
against the walls of uterine dogmas -- into a partly hairy and somewhat 
reptilian mass of social undevelopment comes exclusionist explanation 
suitable for such immaturity. 

It does not matter which of our subjects we take up, our experience is 
unvarying: the standardized explanation will be Exclusionism. As to many 
appearances in the sky, the way of excluding foreign forces is to say that 
they are auroras, which are supposed to be mundane phenomena. School 
children are taught that auroras are electric manifestations encircling the 
poles of this earth. Respectful urchins are shown an ikon by which an 
electrified sphere does have the polar encirclements that it should have. 
But I have taken a disrespectful, or advanced, course through the Monthly 
Weather Review, and have read hundreds of times of auroras that were not 
such polar crownings: of auroras in Venezuela, Sandwich Islands, Cuba, 
India; of an aurora in Pennsylvania, for instance, and not a sign of it 
north of Pennsylvania. There are lights in the sky for which "auroral" is as 
good a name as any that can be thought of, but there are others for which 
some other names will have to be thought of. There have been lights like 
luminous surfs beating upon the coasts of this earth's atmosphere, and 
lights like vast reflections from distant fires; steady pencils of light and 
pulsating clouds and quick flashes and seeming objects with definite 
outlines, all in one poverty of nomenclature, for which science is, in some 
respects, not notable, called "auroral." Nobody knows what an aurora is. It 
does not matter. This is standardization, and the essence of this 
standardization is Exclusionism. 

I see one resolute, unified, unscrupulous exclusion from science of the 
indications of nearby lands in the sky. It may not be unscrupulousness: it 
may be hypnosis. I see that all seeming [128/129] hypnotics, or 
somnambulists of the past, who have most plausibly so explained, or so 
denied, have prospered and have had renown. According to my impressions, if 
a Brewster, or a Swift, or a Newcomb ever had written that there may be 
nearby lands and living beings in the sky, he would not have prospered, and 
his renown would be still subject to delayal.(1) If an organism flourishes, 
it is said to be in harmony with environment, or with higher forces. I now 
conceive of successful and flourishing Exclusionism as an organization that 
has been in harmony with higher forces. Suppose we accept that all general 
delusions function sociologically. Then, if Exclusionism be general 
delusion; if we shall accept that conceivably the isolation of this earth 
has been a necessary factor in the development of the whole geo-system, we 
see that exclusionistic science has faithfully, though falsely, functioned. 
It would be world-wide crime to spread world-wide too soon the idea that 
there are other existences nearby and that they have been seen and that 
sounds from them have been heard: the peoples of this earth must organize 
themselves before conceiving of, and trying to establish, foreign relations. 
A premature science of such subjects would be like a United States taking 
part in a Franco-Prussian War, when such foreign relations should be still 
far in the future of a nation that has still to concentrate upon its own 
internal development. 

So in the development of all things -- or that a stickleback may build a 
nest, and so may vaguely and not usefully and not explicably at all, in 
terms of Darwinian evolution, foreshadow a character of coming forms of 
life; but that a fish should try to climb a tree and to sing to its mate 
before even the pterodactyl had flapped around with wings daubed with clay 
would be an unnoticed little clown in cosmic drama. But I do conceive that 
when the Carboniferous Era is dominant, and when not a discordant thing will 
be permitted to flourish, though it may adumbrate, restrictions will not 
last forever, and that the rich and bountiful curse upon rooted things will 
some day be lifted. [129]

CHAPTER EIGHT





PATCHED by a blue inundation that had never been seen before -- this earth, 
early in the 60's of the 19th century. Then faintly, from far away, this new 
appearance is seen to be enveloped with volumes of gray. Flashes like 
lightning, and faintest of rumbling sounds -- then cloud-like envelopments 
roll away, and a blue formation shines in the sun. Meteorologists upon the 
moon take notes. 

But year after year there are appearances, as seen from the moon, that are 
so characterized that they may not be meteorologic phenomena upon this 
earth: changing compositions wrought with elements of blue and of gray; it 
is like conflict between Synthesis and Dissolution: straight lines that fade 
into scrawls, but that re-form into seeming moving symbols: circles and 
squares and triangles abound. 

Having had no mean experience with interpretations as products of desires, 
given that upon the moon communication with this earth should be desired, it 
seems likely to me that the struggles of hosts of Americans, early in the 
60's of the 19th century, were given thought by some lunarians to be 
manoeuvres directed to them, or attempts to attract their attention. 
However, having had many impressions upon the resistance that new delusions 
encounter, so that, at least upon this earth, some benightments have had to 
wait centuries before finally imposing themselves generally, I'd think of 
considerable time elapsing before the coming of a general conviction upon 
the moon that, by means of living symbols, and the firing of explosives, 
terrestrians were trying to communicate. 

Beacon-like lights that have been seen upon the moon. The lights have been 
desultory. The latest of which I have record was back in the year 1847. But 
now, if beginning in the early 60's, though not coinciding with the 
beginning of unusual and tremendous manifestations upon this earth, we have 
data as if of greatly stimulated attempts to communicate from the moon -- 
[130/131] why one assimilates one's impressions of such great increase with 
this or with that, all according to what one's dominant thoughts may be, and 
calls the product a logical conclusion. Upon the night of May 15, 1864, 
Herbert Ingall, of Camberwell, saw a little to the west of the lunar crater 
Picard, in the Mare Crisium, a remarkably bright spot (Astro. Reg., 2-
264).(1) 

Oct. 24, 1864 -- period of nearest approach by Mars -- red lights upon 
opposite parts of Mars (C.R., 85-538).(2) Upon Oct. 16, Ingall had again 
seen the light west of Picard.(3) Jan. 1, 1865 -- a small speck of light, in 
darkness, under the east foot of the lunar Alps, shining like a small star, 
watched half an hour by Charles Grover (Astro. Reg., 3-255).(4) Jan. 3, 1865 
-- again the red lights of Mars (C.R., 85-538).(5) A thread of data appears, 
as an offshoot from a main streak, but it can not sustain itself. Lights on 
the moon and lights on Mars, but I have nothing more that seems to signify 
both signals and responses between these two worlds. 

April 10, 1865 -- west of Picard, according to Ingall -- "a most minute 
point of light, glittering like a star" (Astro. Reg., 3-189).(6) 

Sept. 5, 1865 -- a conspicuous bright spot west of Picard (Astro. Reg., 3-
252).(7) It was seen again by Ingall. He saw it again upon the 7th, but upon 
the 8th it had gone, and there was a cloud-like effect where the light had 
been. 

Nov. 24, 1865 -- a speck of light that was seen by the Rev. W.O. Williams, 
shining like a small star in the lunar crater Carlini (Intel. Obs., 11-
58).(8) 

June 10, 1866 -- the star-like light in Aristarchus; reported by Tempel 
(Denning, Telescopic Work, p. 121).(9) 

Astronomically and seleno-meteorologically, nothing that I know of has ever 
been done with these data. I think well of taking up the subject 
theologically. We are approaching accounts of a different kind of changes 
upon the moon. There will be data seeming so to indicate not only 
persistence but devotedness upon the moon that I incline to think not only 
of devotedness but of devotions. Upon the 16th of October, 1866, the 
astronomer Schmidt, of the land of Socrates, announced that the isolated 
object, in the eastern part of the Mare Serenitatis, known as Linné, had 
changed. Linné stands out in a blank area like the Pyramid [131/132] of 
Cheops in its desert. If changes did occur upon Linné, the conspicuous 
position seems to indicate selection. Before October, 1866, Linné was well-
known as a dark object. Something was whitening an object that had been 
black. 

A hitherto unpublished episode in the history of theologies: 

The new prophet who had appeared upon the moon -- 

Faint perceptions of moving formations, often almost rigorously geometric, 
upon one part of this earth, and perhaps faintest of signal-like sounds that 
reached the moon -- the new prophet -- and that he preached the old lunar 
doctrine that there is no god but the Earth-god, but exhorted his hearers to 
forsake their altars upon which had burned unheeded lights, and to build a 
temple upon which might be recited a litany of lights and shades. 

We are only now realizing how the Earth-god looks to the beings of the moon 
-- who know that this earth is dominant; who see it frilled with the loops 
of the major planets; its Elizabethan ruff wrought by the complications of 
the asteroids; the busy little sun that brushes off the dark. 

God of the moon, when mists make it expressionless -- a vast, bland, silvery 
Buddha. 

God of the moon, when seeing it clear -- when the disguise is off -- when, 
at night, from pointed white peaks drip the fluctuating red lights of a 
volcano, this earth is the appalling god of carnivorousness. 

Sometimes the great roundish earth, with the heavens behind it broken by 
refraction, looks like something thrust into a shell from external existence 
-- clouds of tornadoes as if in its grasp -- and it looks like the fist of 
God, clutching rags of ultimate fire and confusion. 

That a new prophet had appeared upon the moon, and had excited new hope of 
evoking response from the bland and shining Stupidity that has so often been 
mistaken for God, or from the Appalling that is so identified with Divinity 
-- from the clutched and menacing fist that has so often been worshipped. 

There is no intelligence except era-intelligence. Suppose the whole geo-
system be a super-embryonic thing. Then, by the law of the embryo, its parts 
cannot organize until comes scheduled time. So there are local congeries of 
development of a chick in [132/133] an egg, but these local centers can not 
more than faintly sketch out relations with one another, until comes the 
time when they may definitely integrate. Suppose that far back in the 19th 
century there were attempts to communicate from the moon; but suppose that 
they were premature: then we suppose the fate of the protoplasmic threads 
that feel out too soon from one part of an egg to another. In October, 1866, 
Schmidt, of Athens, saw and reported in terms of the concepts of his era, 
and described in conventional selenographic language. See Rept. B.A., 
1867.(10) 

Upon December 14, 16, 25, 27, 1866, Linné was seen as a white spot.(11) But 
there was something that had the seeming more of a design, or of a pattern, 
an elaboration upon the mere turning to white of something that had been 
black -- a fine, black spot upon Linné; by Schmidt and Buckingham, in 
December, 1866 (The Student, 1-261).(12) The most important consideration of 
all is reviewed by Schmidt in the Rept. B.A., 1867-22 -- that sunlight and 
changes of sunlight had nothing to do with the changing appearances of 
Linné.(13) Jan. 14, 1867 -- the white covering, or, at least, seeming of 
covering, of Linné, had seemingly disappeared -- Knott's impression of Linné 
as a dark spot, but "definition" was poor. Jan. 16 -- Knott's very strong 
impression, which, however, he says may have been an illusion, of a small 
central dark spot upon Linné. Dawes' observation, of March 15, 1867 -- "an 
excessively minute black dot in the middle of Linné." 

A geometric figure that was white-bordered and centered with black, formed 
and dissolved and formed again. 

I have an impression of spectacles that were common in the United States, 
during the War: hosts of persons arranging themselves in living patterns: 
flags, crosses, and in one instance, in which thousands were engaged, in the 
representation of an enormous Liberty Bell. Astronomers have thought of 
trying to communicate with Mars or the moon by means of great geometric 
constructions placed conspicuously, but there is nothing so attractive to 
attention as change, and a formation that could appear and disappear would 
enchance the geometric with the dynamic. That the units of the changing 
compositions that covered Linné were the lunarians themselves -- that Linné 
was terraced -- hosts of the inhabitants of the moon standing upon ridges of 
their Cheops of [133/134] the Serene Sea, some of them dressed in white and 
standing in a border, and some of them dressed in black, centering upon the 
apex, or the dark material of the apex left clear for the contrast, all of 
them unified in a hope of conveying an impression of the geometric, as the 
product of design, and distinguishable from the topographic, to the shining 
god that makes the stars of their heaven marginal. 

It is a period of great activity -- or of conflicting ideas and purposes -- 
upon the moon: new and experimental demonstrations, but also, of course, the 
persistence of the old. In the Astronomical Register, 5-114, Thomas G. Elger 
writes that upon the 9th of April, 1867, he was surprised to see, upon the 
dark part of the moon, a light like a star of the 7th magnitude, at 7.30 
P.M.(14) It became fainter, and looked almost extinguished at 9 o'clock. Mr. 
Elger had seen lights upon the moon before, but never before a light so 
clear -- "too bright to be overlooked by the most careless observer." May 7, 
1867 -- the beacon-like light of Aristarchus -- observed by Tempel, of 
Marseilles, when Aristarchus was upon the dark side of the moon (Astro. 
Reg., 5-220).(15) Upon the night of June 10, 1867, Dawes saw three distinct, 
roundish, black spots near Sulpicius Gallus, which is near Linné; when 
looked for upon the 13th, they had disappeared (The Student, 1-261).(16) 

August 6, 1867 -- 

And this earth in the sky of the moon -- smooth and bland and featureless 
earth -- or one of the scenes that make it divine and appalling -- jaws of 
this earth, as seem to be the rims of more or less parallel mountain ranges, 
still shining in sunlight, but surrounded by darkness -- 

And, upon the moon, the assembling of the Chiaroscuroans, or the lunar 
communicationists who seek to be intelligible to this earth by means of 
lights and shades, patterned upon Linné by their own forms and costumes. The 
Great Pyramid of Linné, at night upon the moon -- it stands out in bold 
triangularity pointing to this earth. It slowly suffuses white -- the upward 
drift of white-clad forms, upon the slopes of the Pyramid. The jaws of this 
earth seem to munch, in variable light. There is no other response. 
Devotions are the food of the gods. 

Upon August 6, 1867, Buckingham saw upon Linné, which [134/135] was in 
darkness, "a rising oval spot" (Rept. B.A., 1867-7). In October, 1867, Linné 
was seen as a convex white spot (Rept. B.A., 1867-8).(17) 


* * *



Also it may be that the moon is not inhabited, and is not habitable. There 
are many astronomers who say that the moon has virtually no atmosphere, 
because when a star is passed over by the moon, the star is not refracted, 
according to them. See Clerke's History of Astronomy, p. 264 -- that, basing 
his calculations upon the fact that a star is never refracted out of place 
when occulted by the moon, Prof. Comstock, of Washburn Observatory, had 
determined that this earth's atmosphere is 5,000 times as dense as the 
moon's.(18) 

I did think that in this secondary survey of ours we had pretty well shaken 
off our old opposition, the astronomers; however, with something of the 
kindliness that one feels for renewed meeting with the familiar, here we are 
at home with the same old kind of demonstrations: the basing of laborious 
calculations upon something that is not so -- 

See index of the Monthly Notices, R.A.S. -- many instances of stars that 
have been refracted out of place when occulted by the moon.(19) See the 
Observatory, 24-210, 313, 315, 345, 414; English Mechanic, 23-197, 279; 26-
229; 52 -- index, under "atmosphere;" 81-60; 84-161; 85-108.(20) 

In the year 1821, Gruithuisen announced that he had discovered a city of the 
moon. He described its main thoroughfare and branching streets. In 1826, he 
announced that there had been considerable building, and that he had seen 
new streets. This formation, which is north of the crater Schroeter, has 
often been examined by disagreeing astronomers: for a sketch of it, in which 
a central line and radiating lines are shown, see the English Mechanic, 18-
638.(21) There is one especial object upon the moon that has been described 
and photographed and sketched so often that I shall not go into the subject. 
For many records of observations, see the English Mechanic and 
L'Astronomie.(22) It is an object shaped like a sword, near the crater Birt. 
Anyone with an impression of the transept of a cathedral, may see the 
architectural here. Or it may be a mound similar to the mounds of [135/136] 
North America that have so logically been attributed to the Mound Builders. 
In a letter, published in the Astronomical Register, 20-167, Mr. Birmingham 
calls attention to a formation that suggests the architectural upon the moon 
-- "a group of three hills in a slightly acute-angled triangle, and 
connected by three lower embankments."(23) There is a geometric object, or 
marking, shaped like an "X," in the crater Eratosthenes (Sci. Amer. Sup., 
59-24, 469); striking symbolic-looking thing or sign, or attempt by means of 
something obviously not topographic, to attract attention upon this earth, 
in the crater Plinius (Eng. Mec., 35-34); reticulations, like those of a 
city's squares, in Plato (Eng. Mec., 64-253; and there is a structural-
looking composition of angular lines in Gassendi (Eng. Mec., 101-466).(24) 
Upon the floor of Littrow are six or seven spots arranged in the form of the 
Greek letter Gamma (Eng. Mec., 101-47).(25) This arrangement may be of 
recent origin, having been discovered Jan. 31, 1915. The Greek letter makes 
difficulty only for those who do not want to think easily upon this subject. 
For a representation of something that looked like a curved wall upon the 
moon, see L'Astronomie, 1888-110.(26) As to appearances like viaducts, see 
L'Astronomie, 1885-213.(27) The lunar craters are not in all instances the 
simple cirques that they are commonly supposed to be. I have many different 
impressions of some of them: I remember one sketch that looked like an owl 
with a napkin tucked under his beak. However, it may be that the general 
style of architecture upon the moon is Byzantine, very likely, or not so 
likely, domed with glass, giving the dome-effect that has so often been 
commented upon. 

So then the little nearby moon -- it is populated by Lilliputians. However, 
our experience with agreeing ideas having been what it has been, we suspect 
that the lunarians are giants. Having reasonably determined that the moon is 
one hundred miles in diameter, we suppose it is considerably more or less. 




* * *



A group of astronomers had been observing extraordinary lights in the lunar 
crater Plato. The lights had definite arrangement. They were so 
individualized that Birt and Elger, and the other selenographers, who had 
combined to study them, had charted and [136/137] numbered them. They were 
fixed in position, but rose and fell in intensity. 

It does seem to me that we have data of one school of communicationists 
after another coming into control of efforts upon the moon. At first our 
data related to single lights. They were extraordinary, and they seem to me 
to have been signals, but there seemed to be nothing of the organization 
that now does seem to be creeping into the fragmentary material that is the 
best that we can find. The grouped lights in Plato were so distinctive, so 
clear and even brilliant, that if such lights had ever shone before, it 
seems that they must have been seen by the Schroeters, Gruithuisens, Beers 
and Mädlers, who had studied and charted the features of the moon. For 
several of Gledhill's observations, from which I derive my impressions of 
these lights, see Rept. B.A., 1871-80 -- "I can only liken them to the small 
discs of stars, seen in the transit-instrument;" "just like small stars in 
the transit instrument, upon a windy night!"(28) 

In August and September, 1869, occurred a notable illumination of the spots 
in Group I. It was accompanied by a single light upon a distant spot. 

February and March, 1870 -- illumination of another group. 

April 17, 1870 -- another illumination in Plato, but back to the first 
group. 

As to his observations of May 10-12, 1870, Birt gives his opinion that the 
lights of Plato were not effects of sunlight.(29) 

Upon the 13th of May, 1870, there was an "extraordinary display," according 
to Birt: 27 lights were seen by Pratt, and 28 by Elger, but only 4 by 
Gledhill, in Brighton. Atmospheric conditions may have made this difference, 
or the lights may have run up and down a scale from 4 to 28. As to 
independence of sunlight, Pratt says (Rept. B.A., 1871-88), at to this 
display, that only the fixed, charted points so shone, and that other parts 
of the crater were not illuminated, as they would have been to an incidence 
common throughout.(30) In Pratt's opinion, and, I think, in the opinion of 
the other observers, these lights were volcanic.(31) It seems to me that 
this opinion arose from a feeling that there should be something of an 
opinion: the idea that the lights might have been signals was not expressed 
by any of these astronomers [137/138] that I know of. I note that, though 
many observers were, at this time, concentrating upon this one crater, there 
are no records findable by me of such disturbance of detail as might be 
supposed to accompany volcanic action. The clear little lights seem to me to 
have been anything but volcanic. 

The play of these lights of Plato -- their modulations and their 
combinations -- like luminous music -- or a composition of signals in a code 
that even in this late day may be deciphered. It was like orchestration -- 
and that something like a baton gave direction to Light 22, upon August 12, 
1870, to shine a leading part -- "remarkable increase of brightness." No. 22 
subsided, and the leading part shone out in No. 14. It, too, subsided, and 
No. 16 brightened. 

Perhaps there were definite messages in a Morse-like code. There is a chance 
for the electricity in somebody's imagination to start crackling. Up to 
April, 1871, the selenographers had recorded 1,600 observations upon the 
fluctuations of the lights of Plato, and had drawn 37 graphs of individual 
lights. All graphs and other records were deposited by W.R. Birt in the 
Library of the Royal Astronomical Society, where presumably they are to this 
day. A Champollion may some day decipher hieroglyphics that may have been 
flashed from one world to another. [138]

CHAPTER NINE





OUR data indicate that the planets are circulating adjacencies. Almost do we 
now conceive of a difficulty of the future as being not how to reach the 
planets, but how to dodge them. Especially do we warn aviators away from 
that rhinoceros of the skies, Mercury. I have a note somewhere upon one of 
the wickedest-looking horns in existence, sticking out far from Mercury. I 
think it was Mr. Whitmell who made this observation.(1) I'd like to hear 
Andrew Barclay's opinion on that. I'd like to hear Capt. Noble's. 

If sometimes does the planet Mars almost graze this earth, as is not told by 
the great telescopes, which are only millionaire's memorials, or, at least, 
which reveal but little more than did the little spy glasses used by Burnham 
and Williams and Beer and Mädler -- but if periodically the planet Mars 
comes very close to this earth, and, if Mars, an island with perhaps no more 
surface-area than has England, but likely enough inhabited, like England -- 

June 19, 1875 -- opposition of Mars. 

Flashes that were seen in the sky upon the 25th of June, 1875, by Charles 
Gape, of Scole, Norfolk (Eng. Mec., 21-488).(2) The Editor of Symons' Met. 
Mag. (see vol. 10-116), was interested, and sent Mr. Gape some questions, 
receiving answers that nothing had appeared in the local newspapers upon the 
subject, and that nothing could be learned of a display of fireworks, at the 
time.(3) To Mr. Gape the appearances seemed to be meteoric. 

The year 1877 -- climacteric opposition of Mars. 

There were some discoveries. 

We have at times wondered how astronomers spend their nights. Of course, 
according to many of his writings upon the subject, Richard Proctor had an 
excellent knowledge of whist.(4) But in the year 1877, two astronomers 
looked up at the sky, and one of them discovered the moons of Mars, and the 
other called atten- [139/140] tion to lines on Mars -- and, if for 
centuries, the moons of Mars could so remain unknown to all inhabitants of 
this earth except, as it were, Dean Swift -- why, it is no wonder that we so 
respectfully heed some of the Dean's other intuitions, and think that there 
may be Lilliputians, or Brobdingnagians, and other forms not conventionally 
supposed to be. As to our own fields of data, I have a striking number of 
notes upon signal-like appearances upon the moon, in the year 1877, but have 
notes upon only one occurrence that, in our interests, may relate to Mars. 
The occurrence is like that of July 31, 1813 and June 19, 1875. 

Sept. 5, 1877 -- opposition of Mars. 

Sept. 7, 1877 -- lights appeared in the sky of Bloomington, Indiana. They 
were supposed to be meteoric. They appeared and disappeared, at intervals of 
three or four seconds; darkness for several minutes; then a final flash of 
light. See Sci. Amer., 37-193.(5)

That all luminous objects that are seen in the sky when the planet Venus is 
nearest may not be Venus; may not be fire-balloons: 

In the Dundee Advertiser, Dec. 22, 1882, it is said that, between 10 and 11 
A.M., Dec. 21, at Broughty Ferry, Scotland, a correspondent had seen an 
unknown luminous body near and a little above the sun.(6) In the Advertiser, 
Dec. 25, is published a letter from someone who says that this object had 
been seen at Dundee, also; that quite certainly it was the planet Venus and 
"no other."(7) In Knowledge, 2-489, this story is told by a writer who says 
that undoubtedly the object was Venus.(8) But in Knowledge, 3-13, the 
astronomer J.E. Gore writes that the object could not have been Venus, which 
upon this date was 1 h. 33 m., R. A., west of the sun.(9) The observation is 
reviewed in L'Astronomie, 1883-109.(10) Here it is said that the position of 
Mercury accorded better. Reasonably this object could not have been Mercury: 
several objections are comprehended in the statement that superior 
conjunction of Mercury had occurred upon December 16.(11) 

Upon Feb. 3, 1884, M. Staevert, of the Brussels Observatory, saw, upon the 
disc of Venus, an extremely brilliant point (Ciel et Terre, 5-127).(12) Nine 
days later, Niesten saw just such a point [140/141] of light as this, but at 
a distance from the planet. If no one had ever heard that such things can 
not be, one might think that these two observations were upon something that 
had been seen leaving Venus and had then been seen farther along. Upon the 
3rd of July, 1884, a luminous object was seen moving slowly in the sky of 
Norwood, N.Y. It had features that suggest the structural: a globe the size 
of the moon, surrounded by a ring; two dark lines crossing the nucleus 
(Science Monthly, 2-136).(13) Upon the 26th of July, 1884, a luminous globe, 
size of the moon, was seen at Cologne; it seemed to be moving upward from 
this earth, then was stationary "some minutes," and then continued upward 
until it disappeared (Nature, 30-360).(14) 

And in the English Mechanic, 40-130, it is not said that a luminous vessel 
that had sailed out from Venus, in February, visiting this earth, where it 
was seen in several places, was seen upon its return to the planet, but it 
is said that an observer in Rochester, N.Y., had, upon August 17, seen a 
brilliant point upon Venus.(15) [141]

Whitmell writes: "Just after first external contact, and visible for some 
time after (when the planet was fully on the sun), there appeared a little 
black horn of length equal to the planet's diameter. This horn was 
projecting from the side of the planet towards the sun's centre, and 
therefore had nothing to do with the `black drop,' which I did not see. The 
horn was a very curious feature, and was seen by my wife as well as by 
myself. It was, of course, an optical illusion. I shall be grateful for an 
explanation of it."

11. The American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac for the Year 1882. 2nd ed. 
Washington, D.C.: Bureau of Navigation, 1880, 483. On December 21, 1882, 
several people in Broughty Ferry, Scotland, reported a "strange phenomenon," 
according to the Dundee Advertiser. Their correspondent wrote: "Yesterday 
forenoon, between ten and eleven o'clock, the attention of several persons 
in Broughty Ferry was directed for a time to a somewhat unusual sight in the 
heavens. The sun at the same time was shining brightly, being about due 
south, when a star was seen in close proximity to it. The star was a little 
above the sun's path, and the peculiar phenomenon was seen by various 
persons, who had their attention directed to it. Being daytime, the star did 
not have the brilliant luminous radiance stars exhibit at night, but was of 
a milky white appearance, and seemed, when seen through a glass, to be of a 
crescent shape. Being on a light blue ground, and lying between two white 
clouds, it was seen to great advantage". Fort's doubts were prompted by 
alternative explanations given by the astronomers reporting on this event. 
The Advertiser article of December 22nd was repeated in Knowledge, without 
an attempt at identification; but, John Ellard Gore wrote a letter, 
disputing Venus as a possible explanation, offering two stars in Sagittarius 
as possible explanations, (though Kaus Australis never would have risen 
above the horizon on that date in this location), but suggesting a flaring 
up of "Kepler's celebrated 'Nova,' of 1604." The French publication 
Astronomie further complicated the issue by disputing Venus and suggesting 
that Mercury was a better (closer) candidate for an explanation. However, 
Mercury would have been south (below) the sun and too close for observation. 
The explanations offered by the astronomers ignored Mars, which would have 
been close to the sun and to the west of it; but, the identification of 
Venus was made by another correspondent in the Dundee Advertiser, (December 
25, 1882). This latter correspondent wrote: "The description which he gives 
of it makes it quite certain that it was the planet Venus, and no other. It 
is at present a little to the west of the sun, and above it," and, "....At 
present it is of a crescent shape...." A daytime sighting of Venus appears 
to be the most likely explanation.

CHAPTER TEN





EXPLOSIONS over the town of Barisal, Bengal, if they were aërial explosions, 
were continuing. As to some of these detonations that were heard in May, 
1874, a writer in Nature, 53-197, says that they did seem to come from 
overhead.(1) For a report upon the Barisal Guns, heard between April 28, 
1888, and March 1, 1889, see Proc. Asiatic Soc. of Bengal, 1899-199.(2) 

Phenomena at Comrie were continuing. The latest date in Roper's List of 
Earthquakes is April 8, 1886, but this list goes on only a few years 
later.(3) See Knowledge, n. s., 6-145 -- shock and a rumbling sound at 
Comrie, July 12, 1894 -- a repetition upon the corresponding date, the next 
year.(4) In the English Mechanic, 74-155, David Packer says that, upon Sept. 
17, 1901, ribbon-like flashes of lightning, which were not ordinary 
lightning, were seen in the sky (I think of Birmingham) one hour before a 
shock in Scotland.(5) According to other accounts, this shock was in Comrie 
and surrounding regions (London Times, Sept. 19, 1901).(6) 

Smithson. Miscell. Cols., 37-Appendix, p. 71:(7) 

According to L. Tennyson, Quartermaster's Clerk, at Fort Klamath, Oregon, at 
daylight, Jan. 8, 1867, the garrison was startled from sleep by what he 
supposed to be an earthquake and a sound like thunder. Then came darkness, 
and the sky was covered with black smoke or clouds. Then ashes, of a 
brownish color, fell -- "as fast as I ever saw it snow." Half an hour later 
there was another shock, described as "frightful." No one was injured, but 
the sutler's store was thrown a distance of ninety feet, and the vibrations 
lasted several minutes. Mr. Tennyson thought that somewhere near Fort 
Klamath, a volcano had broken loose, because, in the direction of the 
Klamath Marsh, a dark column of smoke was seen. I can find record of no such 
volcanic eruption. In a list of quakes, in Oregon, from 1846, to 1916, 
[142/143] published in the Bull. Seis. Soc. Amer., Sept., 1919, not one is 
attributed to volcanic eruptions.(8) Mr. W.D. Smith, compiler of the list, 
says, as to the occurrence at Fort Klamath -- "If there was an eruption, 
where was it?" He asks whether possibly it could have been Lassen Peak. But 
Lassen Peak is in California, and the explosion upon Jan. 8, 1867, was so 
close to Fort Klamath that almost immediately ashes fell from the sky. 

The following is of the type of phenomena that might be considered evidence 
of signalling from some unknown world nearby: 

La Nature, 17-126 -- that, upon June 17, 1881, sounds like cannonading were 
heard at Gabes, Tunis, and that quaking of the earth was felt, at intervals 
of 32 seconds, lasting about 6 minutes.(9) 

July 30, 1883 -- a somewhat startling experience -- steamship Resolute alone 
in the Arctic Ocean -- six reports like gunfire -- Nature, 53-295.(10) 

In Nature, 30-19, a correspondent writes that, upon the 3rd of January, 
1869, a policeman in Harlton, Cambridgeshire, heard six or seven reports, as 
if of heavy guns far away.(11) There is no findable record of an earthquake 
in England upon this date. In the London Times, Jan. 12, 15, 16, 1869, 
several correspondents write that upon the 9th of January a loud report had 
been heard and a shock felt at places near Colchester, Essex, about 30 miles 
from Harlton.(12) One of the correspondents writes that he had heard the 
sound but had felt no shock. In the London Standard, Jan. 12, the Rev. J.F. 
Bateman, of South Lopham, Norfolk, writes as to the occurrence upon the 9th 
-- "An extraordinary vibration (described variously by my parishioners as 
being `like a gunpowder explosion,' `a big thunder clap,' and `a little 
earthquake' was noticed here this morning about 11.20."(13) In the Morning 
Post, Jan. 14, it is said that at places about twenty miles from Colchester 
it was thought that an explosion had occurred, upon the 9th, but, inasmuch 
as no explosion had been heard of, the disturbance was attributed to an 
earthquake.(14) Night of Jan. 13 -- an explosion in the sky, at Brighton 
(Rept. B.A., 1869-307.(15) In the Standard, Jan. 22, a correspondent writes 
from Swaffham, Norfolk, that, about 8 P.M., Jan. 15, something of an unknown 
nature had frightened flocks of sheep, which had [143/144] burst from their 
bounds in various places.(16) All these occurrences were in adjoining 
counties in southeastern England. Something was seen in the sky upon the 
13th, and, according to the Chudleigh Weekly Express, Jan. 13, 1869, 
something was seen in the sky, night of the 10th, at Weston-super-Mare, near 
Bristol, in southwestern England.(17) It was seen between 9 and 10 o'clock, 
and is said to have been an extraordinary meteor. Five hours later were felt 
three shocks said to have been earthquakes. 

Upon the night of March 17, 1871, there was a series of events in France, 
and a series in England. A "meteor" was seen at Tours, at 8 P.M. -- at 
10.45, a "meteor" that left a luminous cloud over Saintes (Charante-
Inferieure) -- another at Paris, 11.15, leaving a mark in the sky, of 
fifteen minutes' duration -- another at Tours, at 11.45 P.M. See Les Mondes, 
24-190, and Comptes Rendus, 72-789.(18) There were "earthquakes" this night 
affecting virtually all England north of the Mersey and the Trent, and also 
southern parts of Scotland. As has often been the case, the phenomena were 
thought to have been explosions and were then said to have been earthquakes 
when no terrestrial explosions could be heard of (Symons' Met. Mag., 6-
39).(19) There were six shocks near Manchester, between 6 and 7 P.M., and 
others about 11 P.M.; and in Lancashire about 11 P.M., and continuing in 
places as far apart as Liverpool and Newcastle, until 11.30 o'clock. The 
shocks felt about 11 o'clock correspond, in time, with the luminous 
phenomena in the sky of France, but our way of expressing that these so-
called earthquakes in England may have been concussions from repeating 
explosions in the sky, is to record that, according to correspondence in the 
London Times, there were, upon the 20th, aërial phenomena in the region of 
Lancashire that had been affected upon the 17th -- "sounds that seemed to 
come from a number of guns at a distance" and "pale flashes of lightning in 
the sky."(20) 

Whether these series of phenomena be relatable to Mars or Martians or not, 
we note that in 1871 opposition of Mars was upon March 19; and, in 1869, 
upon Feb. 13; and in 1867 two days after the explosions at Fort Klamath. In 
our records in this book, similar coincidences can be found up to the year 
1879. [144/145] I have other such records not here published, and others 
that will be here investigated. 

There is a triangular region in England, three points of which appear so 
often in our data that the region should be specially known to us, and I 
know it myself as the London Triangle. It is pointed in the north by 
Worcester and Hereford, in the south by Reading, Berkshire, and in the east 
by Colchester, Essex. The line between Colchester and Reading runs through 
London. 

Upon Feb. 18, 1884, at West Mersea, near Colchester, a loud report was heard 
(Nature, 53-4).(21) Upon the 22nd of April, 1884, centering around 
Colchester, occurred the severest earthquake in England in the 19th century. 
For several columns of description, see the London Times, April 23.(22) 
There is a long list of town in which there was great damage: in 24 parishes 
near Colchester, 1250 buildings were damaged. One of the places that 
suffered most was West Mersea (Daily Chronicle, April 28).(23) 

There was something in the sky. According to George P. Yeats (Observations 
on the Earthquake of Dec. 17, 1896, p. 6), there was a red appearance in the 
sky over Colchester, at the time of the shock of April 22, 1884.(24) 

The next day, according to a writer in Knowledge, 5-336, a stone fell from 
the sky, breaking glass in his greenhouse, in Essex.(25) It was a quartz 
stone, and unlike anything usually known as meteoric. 

The indications, according to my reading of the data, and my impressions of 
such repeating occurrences as those at Fort Klamath, are that perhaps an 
explosion occurred in the sky, near Colchester, upon Feb. 18, 1884; that a 
great explosion did occur over Colchester, upon the 22nd of April, and that 
a great volume of débris spread over England, in a northwesterly direction, 
passing over Worcestershire and Shropshire, and continuing on toward 
Liverpool, nucleating moisture and falling in blackest of rain. From the 
Stonyhurst Observatory, near Liverpool, was reported, occurring at 11 A.M., 
April 26, "the most extraordinary darkness remembered"; forty minutes later 
fell rain "as black as ink," and then black snow and black hail (Nature, 30-
6).(26) Black hail fell at Chaigley, several miles from Liverpool 
(Stonyhurst Mag- [145/146] azine, 1-267).(27) Five hours later, black 
substance fell at Crowle, near Worcester (Nature, 30-32).(28) Upon the 28th, 
at Church Stretton and Much Wenlock, Shropshire, fell torrents of liquid 
like ink and water in equal proportions (The Field, May 3, 1884).(29) In the 
Jour. Roy. Met. Soc., 11-7, it is said that, upon the 28th, half a mile from 
Lilleshall, Shropshire, an unknown pink substance was brought down by a 
storm.(30) Upon the 3rd of May, black substance fell again at Crowle 
(Nature, 30-32).(31) 

In Nature, 30-216, a correspondent writes that, upon June 22, 1884, at 
Fletching, Sussex, southwest of Colchester, there was intense darkness, and 
that rain then brought down flakes of soot in such abundance that it seemed 
to be "snowing black."(32) This was several months after the shock at 
Colchester, but my datum for thinking that another explosion, or disturbance 
of some kind, had occurred in the same local sky, is that, as reported by 
the inmates of one house, a slight shock was felt, upon the 24th of June, at 
Colchester, showing that the phenomena were continuing. See Roper's List of 
Earthquakes.(33) 

Was not the loud report heard upon Feb. 18 probably an explosion in the sky, 
inasmuch as the sound was great and the quake little? Were not succeeding 
phenomena sounds and concussions and the fall of débris from explosions in 
the sky, acceptably upon April 22, and perhaps continuing until the 24th of 
June? Then what are the circumstances by which one small part of this 
earth's surface could continue in relation with something somewhere else in 
space?

CHAPTER ELEVEN





UPON the night if the 13th of July, 1875, at midnight, two officers of the 
H.M.S. Coronation, in the Gulf of Siam, saw a luminous projection from the 
moon's upper limb (Nature, 12-495).(1) Upon the 14th it was gone, but a 
smaller projection was seen from another part of the moon's limb. This was 
in the period of the opposition of Mars. 

Upon the night of Feb. 20, 1877, M. Trouvelot, of the Observatory of Meudon, 
saw, in the lunar crater Eudoxus, which, like almost all other centers of 
seeming signalling, is in the northwestern quadrant of the moon, a fine line 
of light (L'Astronomie, 1885-212).(2) It was like a luminous cable drawn 
across the crater. 

March 21, 1877 -- a brilliant illumination, and not by the light of the sun, 
according to C. Barrett, in the lunar crater Proclus (Eng. Mec., 25-89).(3) 

May 15 and 29, 1877 -- the bright spot west of Picard, (Eng. Mec., 25-
335).(4) 

The changes upon Linné were first seen by Schmidt, in 1866, near the time of 
opposition of Mars. In May, 1877, Dr. Klein announced that a new object had 
appeared upon the moon. It was close to the center of the visible disc of 
the moon, and was in a region that had been most carefully studied by the 
selenographers. In the Observatory, 2-238, is Neison's report from his own 
memoranda.(5) In the years 1874 and 1875, he had studied this part of the 
moon, but had not seen this newly reported object in the crater Hyginus, or 
the object Hyginus N, according to the selenographers' terminology. In the 
Astronomical Register, 17-204, Neison lists, with details, 20 minute 
examinations of this region, from July, 1870, to August, 1875, in which this 
conspicuous object was not recorded.(6) 

June 14, 1877 -- a light on the dark part of the moon, resembling a 
reflection from a moving mirror, reported by Prof. Henry Har- [147/148] 
rison (Sidereal Messenger, 3-150).(7) June 15 -- the bright spot west of 
Picard, according to Birt (Jour. B.A.A., 19-376).(8) Upon the 16th, Prof. 
Harrison thought that again he saw the moving light of the 14th, but shining 
faintly. In the English Mechanic, 25-432, Frank Dennett writes, as to an 
observation of June 17, 1877 -- "I fancied I could detect a minute point of 
light shining out of the darkness that filled Bessel."(9) 

These are data of extraordinary activity upon the moon preceding the 
climacteric opposition of Mars, early in September, 1877. 

Now we have an account of an occurrence during an eclipse of the moon: 

On the night of the eclipse (Aug. 27, 1877) a ball of fire, of the apparent 
size of the moon, was seen, at ten minutes to eleven, dropping apparently 
from cloud to cloud, and the light flashing across the road (Astro. Reg., 
1878-75).(10) 

Astro. Reg., 17-251:(11) 

Nov. 13, 1877 -- Hyginus N standing out with such a prominence as to be seen 
at the first glance; 

Nov. 14, 1877 -- not a trace of Hyginus N, though seeing was excellent: 

Oct. 3, 1878 -- the most conspicuous of all appearances of Hyginus N; 

Oct. 4, 1878 -- not a trace of Hyginus N. 

Upon the night of Nov. 1, 1879, again in the period of opposition of Mars 
(opposition November 12) again the bright spot west of Picard (Jour. B.A.A., 
19-376).(12) But I have several records of observations upon this appearance 
not in times of opposition of Mars. Whether there be any relation with 
anything else or not, at five o'clock, morning of Nov. 1, 1879, a "vivid 
flash" was seen and a shock was felt at West Cumberland (Nature, 21-19).(13) 

In the autumn of the year 1883, began extraordinary atmospheric effects in 
the sky of this earth. For Prof. John Haywood's description of similar 
appearances upon the moon, Nov. 4, 1883, and March 29, 1884, see the 
Sidereal Messenger, 3-121.(14) They were misty light-effects upon the dark 
part of the moon, not like "earthshine." Our expression is that so close is 
the moon to this earth that it, too, may be affected by phenomena in the 
atmosphere of this earth. [148/149] 

Something like another luminous cable, or like a shining wall, that was seen 
in Aristarchus, by Trouvelot, Jan. 23, 1880, (L'Astro., 1885-215); a speck 
of light in Marius, Jan. 13, 1881, by A.S. Williams (Eng. Mec., 32-494); 
unexplained light in Eudoxus, by Trouvelot, May 4, 1881 (L'Astro., 1885-
213); an illumination in Kepler, by Morales, Feb. 5, 1884 (L'Astro., 9-
149).(15) 

In Knowledge, 7-224, William Gray writes that, upon Feb. 19, 1885, he saw, 
in Hercules, a dull, deep, reddish appearance.(16) In Astronomie, 1885-227, 
Lorenzo Kropp, an astronomer of Paysandu, Uruguay, writes that, upon Feb. 
21, 1885, he had seen, in Cassini, a formation not far from Hercules, both 
of them in the northwestern quadrant of the moon, a reddish smoke or 
mist.(17) He had heard that several other persons had seen, not a misty 
appearance, but a star-like light here, and upon the 22nd he had seen a 
definite light, himself, shining like the planet Saturn. 

May 11, 1885 -- two lights upon the moon (L'Astro., 9-73).(18) 

May 11, 1886 -- two lights upon the moon (L'Astro., 6-312).(19) [149]

CHAPTER TWELVE





THAT through lenses rimmed with horizons, inhabitants of this earth have 
seen revelations of other worlds -- that atmospheric strata of different 
densities are lenses -- but that the faults of the wide glasses in the 
observatories are so intensified in atmospheric revelations that all our 
data are distortions. Our acceptance is that every mirage has a primary; 
that in human mind all poetry is based upon observation, and that imagery in 
the sky is similarly uncreative. If a mirage can not be traced to the known 
upon this earth, one supposes that it is either a derivation from the 
unknown upon this earth, or from the unknown somewhere else. We shall have 
data of a series of mirages in Sweden, or upon the shores of the Baltic, 
from Oct., 1881, to Dec., 1888. I take most of the data from Nature, 
Knowledge, Cosmos, and L'Astronomie, published in this period.(1) I have no 
data of such appearances in this region either before or after this period: 
the suggestion in my own mind is that they were not mirages from terrestrial 
primaries, or they would not be so confined to one period, but were shadows 
or mirages from something that was in temporary suspension over the Baltic 
and Sweden, all details distorted and reported in terms of familiar 
terrestrial appearances. 

Oct. 10, 1881 -- that at Rugenwalde, Pomerania, the mirage of a village had 
been seen: snow-covered roofs from which hung icicles; human forms 
distinctly visible. It was believed that the mirage was a representation of 
the town of Nexo, on the island of Bornholm. Rugenwalde is on the Baltic, 
and Nexo is about 100 miles northwest, in the Baltic.(2) 

The first definite account of the mirages of Sweden, findable by me, is 
published in Nature, June 29, 1882, where it is said that preceding 
instances had attracted attention -- that, in May, 1882, over Lake Orsa, 
Sweden, representations of steamships had been seen, and then "islands 
covered with vegetation."(3) Night of [150/151] May 19, 1883 -- beams of 
light at Lake Ludyika, Sweden -- they looked like a representation of a lake 
in moonshine, with shores covered with trees, showing faint outlines of 
farms (Monthly Weather Review, May, 1883).(4) May 28, 1883 -- at Finsbo, 
Sweden -- changing scenes, at short intervals: mountains, lakes, and 
farms.(5) 

Oct. 16, 1884 -- Lindsberg -- a large town, with four-storied houses, a 
castle and a lake.(6) May 22, 1885 -- Gothland -- a town surrounded by high 
mountains, a large vessel in front of the town.(7) June 15, 1885 -- near 
Oxelosund -- two wooded islands, a construction upon one of them, and two 
warships.(8) It is said that at the time two Swedish warships were at sea, 
but were at considerable distance north of Oxelosund. Sept. 12, 1885 -- 
Valla -- a representation that is said to have been a "remarkable mirage" 
but that is described as if the appearances were cloud-forms -- several 
monitors, one changing into a spouting whale, and the other into a crocodile 
-- then forests -- dancers -- a wooded island with buildings and a park.(9) 
Sept. 29, 1885 -- again at Valla -- between 8 and 9 o'clock, P.M.; a lurid 
glare upon the northwestern horizon; a cloud bank -- animals, groups of 
dancers, a forest, and then a park with paths.(10) 

July 15, 1888 -- Hudikwall -- a tempestuous sea, and a vessel upon it; a 
small boat leaving the vessel.(11) Upon Oct. 8, 1888, at Merexull, on the 
Baltic, but in Russia, was seen a mirage of a city that lasted an hour. It 
is said that some buildings were recognized, and that the representation was 
identified with St. Petersburg, which is about 200 miles from the 
Baltic.(12) 




* * *



That a large, substantial mass, presumably of land, can be in at least 
temporary suspension over a point upon this earth's surface, and not fall, 
and be, in ordinary circumstances, invisible -- 

In L'Astronomie, 1887-426, MM. Codde and Payan, both of them astronomers, 
well-known for their conventional observations and writings, publish 
accounts of an unknown body that appeared upon the sun's limb, for twenty or 
thirty seconds, after the eclipse of August 19, 1887.(13) They saw a round 
body, apparent diameter about one tenth of the apparent diameter of the sun, 
according to the sketch that is published. In L'Astronomie, these two 
observers write separately, and, in the city of Marseilles, their [151/152] 
observations were made at a distance apart. But the unknown body was seen by 
both upon the same part of the sun's limb. So it is supposed that it could 
not have been a balloon, nor a circular cloud, nor anything else very near 
this earth. But many astronomers in other parts of Europe were watching this 
eclipse, and it seems acceptable that others, besides two in Marseilles, 
continued to look, immediately after the eclipse; but from nowhere else came 
a report upon this object, so that all indications are that it was far from 
the sun and near Marseilles, but farther than clouds or balloons in this 
local sky. I can draw no diagram that can satisfy all these circumstances, 
except by supposing the sun to be only a few thousand miles away. 




* * *



If little black stones fall four times, in eleven years, to one part of this 
earth's surface, and fall nowhere else, we are, in conceiving of a fixed 
origin somewhere above a stationary earth, at least conceiving in terms of 
data, and, whether we are fanatics or not, we are not of the type of other 
upholders of stationariness of this earth, who care more for Moses than they 
do for data. I'd not like to have it thought that we are not great admirers 
of Moses, sometimes. 

The rock that hung in the sky of Servia -- 

Upon October 13, 1872, a stone fell from the sky, to this earth, near the 
town of Soko-Banja, Servia. If it were not a peculiar stone, there is no 
force to this datum. It is said that it was unknown stone. A name was 
invented for it. The stone was called banjite, after the town near which it 
fell. 

Seventeen years later (Dec. 1, 1889) another rock of banjite fell in Servia, 
near Jelica. 

For Meunier's account of these stones, see L'Astronomie, 1890-272, and 
Comptes Rendus, 92-331.(14) Also, see La Nature, 1881-1-192.(15) According 
to Meunier these stones did fall from the sky; indigenous to this earth 
there are no such stones; nowhere else have such stones fallen from the sky; 
they are identical in material; they fell seventeen years apart.(16) 




* * *



At times when we think favorably of this work of ours, we see in it a 
pointing-out of an evil of modern specialization. A seis- [152/153] mologist 
studies earthquakes, and an astronomer studies meteors; neither studies both 
earthquakes and meteors, and consequently each, ignorant of the data 
collected by the other, sees no relation between the two phenomena. The 
treatment of the event in Servia, Dec. 1, 1889, is an instance of 
conventional scientific attempts to understand something by separately, or 
specially, focussing upon different aspects, and not combining into an 
inclusive concept. Meunier writes only upon the stones that fell from the 
sky, and does not mention an earthquake at the time. Milne, in his Catalogue 
of Destructive Earthquakes, lists the occurrence as an earthquake, and does 
not mention stones that fell from the sky.(17) All combinations greatly 
affect the character of components: in our combination of two aspects, we 
see that the phenomenon was not an earthquake, as earthquakes are commonly 
understood, though it may have been meteoric; but was not meteoric, in 
ordinary terms of meteors, because of the unlikelihood that meteors, 
identical in material, should, seventeen years apart, fall upon the same 
part of this earth's surface, and nowhere else. 

This occurrence was of course an explosion in the sky, and its vibrations 
were communicated to the earth below, with all the effects of any other kind 
of earthquake. Back in our earliest confusion of the data of a century's 
first quarter, we had awareness of this combination and its conventional 
misinterpretation: that many concussions that have been communicated from 
explosions in the sky have been cataloged in lists of subterranean 
earthquakes. We are farther along now, in our data of the 19th century, and 
now we come across awareness, in other minds, of this distinguishment. At 
8.20 A.M., Nov. 20, 1887, was heard and felt something that was reported 
from many places in the region that is known to us as the London Triangle, 
as an earthquake, though in some towns it was thought to be a great 
explosion, perhaps in London, had occurred. It was reported from Reading, 
and from places where the concussion was greatest. There were several 
accounts of slight alarm among sheep, which are sensitive to meteors and 
earthquakes. But, in Symons' Met. Mag., Mr. H.G. Fordham wrote that the 
occurrence was not an earthquake, that a meteor had exploded.(18) He had 
very little to base [153/154] this opinion upon: out of scores of 
descriptions, he had record of only two assertions that something had been 
seen in the sky. Nevertheless, because the sound was so much greater than 
the concussion, Mr. Fordham came to his conclusion. 

In Symons' Met. Mag., 23-154, Dr. R.H. Wake writes that, upon the evening of 
Nov. 3, 1888, in a region about four miles wide and ten or fifteen miles 
long, in the Thames Valley (near Reading) flocks of sheep had rushed from 
their folds in a common alarm.(19) About a year later, in the Chiltern 
Hills, which extend in a northeasterly direction from the Thames Valley, 
near Reading, there was another such occurrence. In the London Standard, 
Nov. 7, 1889, the Rev. J. Ross Barker, of Chesham, a town about 25 miles 
northeast of Reading, writes that, upon Oct. 25, 1889, many flocks of sheep, 
in a region of 30 square miles, had, by common impulse, broken from their 
folds.(20) Mr. Barker asks whether anyone knew of a meteor or of an 
earthquake at the time.(21) In vol. 24, Symons' Met. Mag., Mr. Symons 
accepts that all three of these occurrences were effects of meteoric 
explosions in the sky.(22) The phenomena are insignificant relatively to 
some that we have considered: the significance is in this definite 
recognition in orthodoxy, itself, that some supposed earthquakes, or effects 
of supposed earthquakes, are reactions to explosions in the sky. [154]

CHAPTER THIRTEEN





EXPLODING monasteries that shoot out clouds of monks into cyclonic 
formations with stormy nuns similarly dispossessed -- or collapsing 
monasteries -- sometimes slowly crumbling confines of the cloistered -- by 
which we typify all things: that all developments pass through a process of 
walling-away within shells that will break. Once upon a time there was a 
shell around the United States. The shell broke. Some other things were 
smashed. 

The doctrines of great distances among heavenly bodies, and of a moving 
earth are the strongest elements of Exclusionism: the mere idea of 
separations by millions of miles discourages thoughts of communication with 
other worlds; and only to think that this earth shoots through space at a 
velocity of 19 miles a second puts an end to speculation upon how to leave 
it and how to return. But, if these two conventions be features of a 
walling-away like that of a chick within its shell, or that the United 
States within its boundaries, and if some day all such confinements of the 
embryonic break, our own prophecy, in the vague terms of all successful 
prophecies, is that a matured view of astronomic phenomena will be from a 
litter of broken demonstrations. 

Our expression now is upon the function of Isolation in Development. 
Specially it is not ours, because I think we learned it from the biologists, 
but we are applying it generally. If the general expression be accepted, we 
conceive that functionally have the astronomers taught that planets are 
millions of miles away, and that this earth moves at such terrific velocity 
that it is encysted with speed. Whether isolations function or not, that 
exclusions that break down are typical of all developments is signified by 
data upon all growing things, beginning with the aristocratic seeds, which, 
however, liberalize to intercourse with mean materials or die. All animal-
organisms are at first walled away. [155/156] In human circumstances 
conditions are the same. The development of every science has been a series 
of temporary exclusions, and the story of every industry tells of inventions 
that were resisted, but that were finally admitted. At the beginning of the 
nineteenth century, Hegel published his demonstration that there could be 
only seven planets: too late to recall his work, he learned that Ceres had 
been discovered. It is our expression that the mental state of Hegel partook 
of a general spirit of his time, and that it was necessary, or that it 
functioned, because early astronomers could scarcely have systematized their 
doctrine had they been bewildered by seven or eight hundred planetary 
bodies; and that, besides the functions of the astronomers, according to our 
expressions, there was also their usefulness in breaking down the walls of 
the older, and outlived, orthodoxy. We conceive that it is well that a great 
deal of experience should be withheld from children, and that, any way, in 
their early years, they are sexually isolated, for instance, and our idea is 
that our data have been held back by no outspoken conspiracy, but by an 
inhibition similar to that by which a great deal of biology, for instance, 
is not taught to children. But, if we think of something of this kind, 
equally acceptable is it that even in the face of orthodox principles, these 
data have been preserved in orthodox publications, and that, in the face of 
supposed principles of Darwinism, as applied generally they have survived, 
though not in harmony with their environment. 

Tons of paper have been consumed by calculations upon the remoteness of 
stars and planets. But I can find nothing that has been calculated, or said, 
that is sounder than Mr. Shaw's determination that the moon is 37 miles 
away.(1) It is that the Vogels and the Struves and the Newcombs have been 
functionally hypnotized and have usefully spread the embryonic delusion that 
there is a vast, untraversible expanse of space around this earth, or that 
they have had some basis that it has been my misfortune to be unable to 
find, or that there is no pleasant and unaccusatory way of explaining them. 

April 10, 1874 -- a luminous object that exploded in the sky of Kuttenburg, 
Bohemia. It is said that the glare was like sunlight, and that the 
"terrifying flash" was followed by a detonation that [156/157] rumbled about 
a minute. April 9, 1876 -- an explosion that is said to have been violent, 
near the town of Rosenau, Hungary. See Rept. B.A., 1877-147.(2) 

These two objects which appeared in virtually the same local sky of this 
earth -- point of explosion 250 miles apart -- came from virtually the same 
point in the sky: constellation of Cassiopeia; different by two degrees in 
right ascension, and with no difference in declination. About the same time 
in the evening: one at 8.9 P.M., and the other at 8.20 P.M. Same night in 
the year, according to extra-terrestrial calendars: the year 1876 was a leap 
year. 

If they had been ordinary meteors, by coincidence two ordinary meteors of 
the same stream might, exactly two years apart, come from almost the same 
point in the heavens and strike almost the same point over this earth. But 
they were two of the most extraordinary occurrences in the records of 
explosions in the sky. Coincidences multiply, or these objects did come from 
the not far-distant constellation of Cassiopeia, and their striking so 
closely together indicates that this earth is stationary; and something of 
the purposeful may be thought of. Serially related to these events, or 
representing some more coincidence, there had been, upon June 9, 1866, a 
tremendous explosion in the sky of Knysahinya, Hungary, and about a thousand 
stones had fallen from the sky (Report B. A., 1867-430).(3) Rosenau and 
Knyahinya are about 75 miles apart. Of course one can very much extend our 
own circumscribed little notions, and think of firing projectiles from 
beyond the stars, just as one can think of unknown lands as being not in the 
immediate sky of Servia or Birmingham or Comrie, but as being beyond the 
nearby stars, reducing everything more than we have reduced -- but the 
firing of stones to this earth seems crude to me. Of course, objects, or 
fragments of objects made of steel, like the manufactured steel of this 
earth, have fallen to this earth, and are now in collections of 
"meteorites." There is a story in a book that is not very accessible to us, 
because it can't be found along with C.R., or Eng. Mec., or L'Astro., of 
tablets of stone that were once upon a time fired to this earth. It may be 
that inhabitants of this earth have been receiving instructions ever since, 
engravings arriving very badly damaged, however. [157/158] 

I have data upon repeating appearances, said to have been "auroral," in a 
local sky. If they were auroral, repetitions at regular intervals and so 
localized are challengers to the most resolute of explainers. If they were 
of extra-mundane origin, they indicate that this earth is stationary. The 
regularity is suggestive of signalling. For instance -- a light in the sky 
of Lyons, N.Y., Dec. 9, 1891, Jan. 5, Feb. 2, Feb. 29, March 27, April 23, 
1892. In the Scientific American, May 7, 1892, Dr. M. A. Veeder writes that, 
from December 9, 1891, to April 23, 1892, there had been a bright light that 
he calls "auroral" in the sky of Lyons, every 27th night.(4) He associates 
the lights with the sun's synodic period, and says that upon each of the 
days preceding a nocturnal display, there had been a disturbance in the sun. 
How a disturbance in the sun could, at night, sun somewhere near the 
antipodes of Lyons, New York, so localize its effects, one can't clear up. 
In Nature, 46-29, Dr. Veeder associates the phenomena with the synodic 
period of the sun, but he says that this period is of 27 days, 6 hours, and 
47 minutes, noting that this period is inconsistent with the phenomena at 
Lyons, making more than a day's difference in the time of his records.(5) 
This precise determination is more of the "exact science" that is driving 
some of us away from refinements into hoping for caves. Different parts of 
the sun move at different rates: I have read of sun spots that moved 
diagonally across the sun. 

In Nature, 15-451, a correspondent writes that, at 8:55 P.M., he saw a large 
red star in Serpens, where he had never seen such an appearance before -- 
Gunnersbury, March 17, 1877.(6) Ten minutes later, the object increased and 
decreased several times, flashing like the revolving light of a lighthouse, 
then disappearing. This correspondent writes that, about 10 P.M., he saw a 
great meteor. He suggests no relation between the two appearances, but there 
may have been relation, and there may be indication of something that was 
stationary at least one hour over Gunnersbury, because the object said to 
have been a "meteor" was first seen at Gunnersbury. In the Observatory, 1-
20, Capt. Tupman writes that, at 9.57 o'clock, a great meteor was first seen 
at Frome, Tetbury, and Gunnersbury.(7) The red object might not have been in 
[158/159] the local sky of Gunnersbury; might have been in the constellation 
Serpens, unseen in all the rest of the world. 

There is a great field of records of "meteors" that, with no parallax, or 
with little parallax, or with little parallax that may be accounted for by 
supposing that observations were not quite simultaneous, have been seen to 
come as if from a star or from a planet, and that may have come from such 
points, indicating that they are not far away. For instance, Rept. B. A., 
1879-77 -- the great meteor of Sept. 5, 1868.(8) It was seen, at Zurich, 
Switzerland, to come from a point near Jupiter; at Tremont, France, origin 
was so close to Jupiter that this object and the planet were seen in the 
same telescopic field; at Bergamo, Italy, it was seen five or six degrees 
from Jupiter. Zurich is about 140 miles from Bergamo, and Tremont is farther 
from Zurich and Bergamo than that. 

So there are data that indicate that objects have come to this earth from 
planets or from stars, enforcing our idea that the remotest planet is not so 
far from this earth as the moon is said, conventionally, to be; and that the 
stars, all equi-distant from this earth might be reached by travelling from 
this earth. One notices that I always conclude that, if phenomena repeatedly 
occur in one local sky of this earth, their origin is traceable to a fixed 
place over a stationary earth. The fixed place over this earth is indicated, 
but that fixed place -- island of space, foreign coast, whatever it may be -
- may be conceived of as accompanying this earth in its rotations and 
revolutions around the sun. Accepting that nothing much is known of 
gravitation; that gravitational astronomy is a myth; that attraction may 
extend but a few miles around this earth, if I can think of something 
hanging unsupported in space, I always think of an island, say, over 
Birmingham, or Irkutsk, or Comrie, as soon flying off by the centrifugal 
force of a rotating earth, or as being soon left behind in a rush around the 
sun. Nevertheless there is good room for discussion here. But when it comes 
to other orders of data, I find one convergence toward the explanation that 
this earth is stationary. But the subject is supposed to be sacred. One must 
not think that this earth is stationary. One must not investigate. [159/160] 
To think upon this subject, except as one is told to think, is, or seems to 
be considered, impious. 

But how can one account for an earth that moves? 

By thinking that something started it and that nothing ever stopped it. 

Earth that doesn't move? 

That nothing ever started it. 

Some more sacrilege. [160]

CHAPTER FOURTEEN





IF a grasshopper could hop on a cannon ball, passing overhead, I could 
conceive, perhaps, how something, from outer space, could flit to a moving 
earth, explore a while, and then hop off. 

But suppose we have to accept that there have been instances of just such 
enterprise and agility, relatively to the planet Venus. Irrespective of our 
notion that it may be that sometimes a vessel sails to this earth from Venus 
and returns, there are striking data indicating that, whether conceivable or 
not, luminous objects have appeared from somewhere, or presumably from outer 
space, and have been seen temporarily suspended over the planet Venus. This 
is in accord with our indications that there are regions in the sky 
suspended over and near this earth. It looks bad for our inference that this 
earth is stationary, but it is the supposed rotary motion of this earth more 
than the supposed orbital motion that seems to us would dislodge such 
neighboring bodies; and all astronomers, except those who say that Venus 
rotates in about 24 hours, say that Venus rotates in about 224 days, a 
velocity that would generate little centrifugal force.(1) 

I have a note upon a determined luminosity that was bent upon Saturn, as its 
objective. In the English Mechanic, 63-496, a correspondent writes that, 
upon July 13, 1896, he saw, through his telescope, from 10 until after 
11.15, P.M., after which the planet was too near the horizon for good 
seeing, a luminous object moving near Saturn.(2) He saw it pass several 
small stars. "It was certainly going toward Saturn at a good rate." There 
may be swifts in the sky that can board planets. If they can swoop on and 
off an earth moving at a rate of 19 miles a second, disregarding rotation, 
because entrance at a pole may be thought of, why, then, for all I know 
smaller things do ride on cannon balls. Of course if our data that indicate 
that the supposed solar system, or the geo-system, is to an enormous degree 
smaller than is con- [161/162] ventionally taught be accepted, the orbital 
velocity of Venus is far cut down. 

About the last of August, 1873 -- Brussels; eight o'clock in the evening -- 
rising above the horizon, into a clear sky, was seen a star-like object. It 
mounted higher and higher, until, about ten minutes later, it disappeared 
(La Nature, 1873-239).(3) It seems that this conspicuous object did appear 
in a local sky, and was therefore not far from this earth. If it were not a 
fire-balloon, one supposes that it did come from outer space, and then 
returned. 

Perhaps a similar thing that visited the moon, and was then seen sailing 
away -- in the Astronomical Register, 23-205, Prof. Schafarik, of Prague, 
writes that upon April 24, 1874, he saw "an object of so peculiar a nature 
that I do not know what to make of it."(4) He saw a dazzling white object 
slowly traversing the disc of the moon. He had not seen it approaching the 
moon. He watched it after it left the moon. Sept. 22, 1881 -- South Africa -
- an object that was seen near the moon by Col. Markwick -- like a comet but 
moving very rapidly (Jour. Liverpool Astro. Soc., 7-117).(5) 

Our chief interest is in objects, like ships, that have "boarded" this 
moving earth with the agility of a Columbus who could dodge a San Salvador 
and throw out an anchor to an American coast screeching past him at a rate 
of 19 miles a second, or in objects that have come as close as atmospheric 
conditions, or unknown conditions, would permit to the bottom of a kind of 
stationary sea. We now graduate Capt. Noble to the extra-geographic fold. In 
Knowledge, 4-173, Capt. Noble writes that, at 10.35 o'clock, night of August 
28, 1883, he saw in the sky something "like a new and most glorious 
comet."(6) First he saw something like the tail of a comet, or it was like a 
search light, according to Capt. Noble's sketch of it in Knowledge. Then 
Capt. Noble saw the nucleus from which this light came. It was a brilliant 
object. Upon page 207, W.K. Bradgate writes that, at 12.40 A.M., August 29, 
at Liverpool, he saw an object like the planet Jupiter, a ray of light 
emanating from it.(7) Upon the nights of Sept. 11 and 13, Prof. Swift saw, 
at Rochester, New York, an unknown object like a comet, perhaps in the local 
sky of Rochester, inasmuch as it was reported from nowhere else 
(Observatory, 6-345).(8) In [162/163] Knowledge, 4-219, Mrs. Harbin writes 
that, upon the night of Sept. 21, at Yeovil, she saw the same brilliant 
searchlight-like light that had been seen by Capt. Noble, but that it had 
disappeared before she could turn her telescope upon it.(9) And several 
months later (Nov., 1883) a similar object was seen obviously not far away, 
but in the local sky of Porto Rico and then of Ohio (Amer. Met. Jour., 1-
110, and Scientific American, 50-40, 97).(10) It may be better not to say at 
this time that we have data for thinking that a vessel carrying something 
like a searchlight, visited this earth, and explored for several months over 
regions as far apart as England and Puerto Rico. Just at present it is 
enough to record that something that was presumably not a fire-balloon 
appeared in the sky of England, close to this earth, if seen nowhere else, 
and in two hours traversed the distance of about 200 miles between Sussex 
and Liverpool. 

Aug. 22, 1885 -- Saigon, Cochin-China -- according to Lieut. Réveillère, of 
the vessel Guiberteau -- object like a magnificent red star, but larger than 
the planet Venus -- it moved no faster than a cloud in a moderate wind; 
observed 7 or 8 minutes, then disappearing behind clouds (C.R., 101-
680).(11) 

In this book it is my frustrated desire to subordinate the theme of this 
earth's stationariness. My subject is New Lands -- things, objects, beings 
that are, or may be, the data of coming expansions -- 

But the stationariness of this earth can not be subordinated. It is crucial. 

Again -- there is no use discussing possible explorations beyond this earth, 
if this earth moves at a rate of 19 miles a second, or 19 miles a minute. 

As to voyagers who may come to or near this earth from other planets -- how 
could they leave and return to swiftly moving planets? According to our 
principles of Extra-geography, the planets move part of the time with the 
revolving stars, the remotest planets remaining in, under, or near one 
constellation years at a time. Anything that could reach, and then travel 
from, a swiftly revolving constellation in the ecliptic could arrive at a 
stellar polar region, where, relatively to a central, stationary body, there 
is no motion. [163]

CHAPTER FIFTEEN





IT may be that we now add to our sins the horse that swam in the sky. For 
all I know, we contribute to a wider biology. In the New York Times, July 8, 
1878, is published a dispatch from Parkersburg, West Virginia: that, about 
July 1, 1878, three or four farmers had seen, in a cloudless sky, apparently 
half a mile high, "an opaque substance."(1) It looked like a white horse, 
"swimming in the clear atmosphere." It is said to have been a mirage of a 
horse in some distant field. If so, it is interesting not only because it 
was opaque, but because of a selection or preference: the field itself was 
not miraged. 

Black bodies and the dark rabbles of the sky -- and that rioting thing, from 
floating anarchies, have often spotted the sun. Then, by all that is 
compensatory, in the balances of existence, there are disciplined forces in 
space. In the Scientific American, 44-291, it is said that, according to 
newspapers of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, figures had been seen in the 
sky in the latter part of September, and the first week in October, 1881, 
reports that "exhibited a mediæval condition of intelligence scarcely less 
than marvellous."(2) The writer suggests that, though probably something was 
seen in the sky, it was only an aurora. Our own intelligence and that of 
astronomers and meteorologists and everybody else with whom we have had 
experience had better not be discussed, but the accusation of mediævalism is 
something that we're sensitive about, and we hasten to the Monthly Weather 
Review, and if that doesn't give us a modern touch, I mistake the sound of 
it. Monthly Weather Review, Sept. and Oct., 1881 -- an auroral display in 
Maryland and New York, upon the 23rd of September; all other auroras far 
north of the three states in which it was said phenomena were seen.(3) 
October -- no auroras until the 18th; that one in the north. There was a 
mirage upon Sept. 23, but at Indianola; two instances in October, but late 
in the month, and in northern states. [164/165] 

It is said, in the Scientific American, that according to the Warrentown 
(Va.) Solid South, a number of persons had seen white-robed figures in the 
sky, at night.(4) The story in the Richmond Dispatch is that many persons 
had seen, or had thought they had seen, an alarming sight in the sky, at 
night: a vast number of armed, uniformed soldiers drilling.(5) Then a 
dispatch from Wilmington, Delaware -- platoons of angels marching and 
countermarching in the sky, their white robes and helmets gleaming. Similar 
accounts came from Laurel and Talbot. Several persons said they had seen, in 
the sky, the figure of President Garfield, who had died not long before. Our 
general acceptance is that all reports upon such phenomena are colored in 
terms of appearances and subjects uppermost in minds. 

L'Astronomie, 1888-392:(6) 

That, about the first of August, 1888, near Warasdin, Hungary, several 
divisions of infantry, led by a chief, who waved a flaming sword, had been 
seen in the sky, three consecutive days, marching several hours a day.(7) 
The writer in L'Astronomie says that in vain does one try to explain that 
this appearance was a mirage of terrestrial soldiers marching at a distance 
from Warasdin, because widespread publicity and investigation had disclosed 
no such soldiers. Even if there had been terrestrial soldiers near Warasdin 
repeating mirages localized would call for explanation. 

But that there may be space-armies, from which reflections or shadows or 
Brocken spectres are sometimes cast -- a procession that crossed the sun: 
forms that moved, or that marched, sometimes four abreast; observation by M. 
Bruguière, at Marseilles, April 15 and 16, 1883 (L'Astro., 5-70).(8) An army 
that was watched, forty minutes, by M. Jacquot, Aug. 30, 1886 (L'Astro., 
1886-71) -- things or beings that seemed to march and to counter-march: all 
that moved in the same direction, moved in parallel lines.(9) In L'Année 
Scientifique, 29-8, there is an account of observations by M. Trouvelot, 
Aug. 29, 1871.(10) He saw objects, some round, some triangular, and some of 
complex forms. Then occurred something that at least suggests that these 
things were not moving in the wind, nor sustained in space by the orbital 
forces of meteors; that each was depending upon its own powers of flight, 
and that [165/166] an accident occurred to one of them. All of them, though 
most of the time moving with great rapidity, occasionally stopped, but then 
one of them fell toward the earth, and the indications are that it was a 
heavy body, and had not been sustained by the wind, which would scarcely 
suddenly desert one of its flotsam and continue to sustain all the others. 
The thing fell, oscillating from side to side like a disc falling through 
water. 

New York Sun, March 16, 1890 -- that, at 4 o'clock, in the afternoon of 
March 12th, in the sky of Ashland, Ohio, was seen a representation of a 
large, unknown city.(11) By some persons it was supposed to be a mirage of 
the town of Mansfield, thirty miles away; other observers thought that they 
recognized Sandusky, sixty miles away. "The more superstitious declared that 
it was a vision of the New Jerusalem." 

May have been a revelation of heaven, and for all I know heaven may resemble 
Sandusky, and those of us who have no desire to go to Sandusky may ponder 
that point, but our own expression is that things have been pictured in the 
sky, and have not been traced to terrestrial origins, but have been 
interpreted always in local terms. Probably a living thing in the sky -- 
seen by farmers -- a horse. Other things, or far-refracted images, or 
shadows -- and they were supposed to be vast lions or soldiers or angels, 
all according to preconceived ideas. Representations that have been seen in 
India -- Hindoo costumes described upon them. Suppose that, in the afternoon 
of January 17, 1892, there was a battle in the sky of Montana -- we know 
just about in what terms the description would be published. Brooklyn Eagle, 
Jan. 18, 1892 -- mirage in the sky of Lewiston, Montana -- Indians and 
hunters alternately charging and retreating.(12) The Indians were in 
superior numbers and captured the hunters. Then details -- hunters tied to 
stakes; the piling of faggots; etc. "So far as could be ascertained last 
night, the Indians on the reservations are peaceable." I think that we're 
peaceable enough, but, unless the astronomers can put us on reservations, 
where we'll work out expressions in beads and wampum instead of data, we'll 
have to carry on a conflict with the vacant minds to which appear mirages of 
their own emptiness in the sometimes swarming skies. 

Altogether there are many data indicating that vessels and liv- [166/167] 
ing things of space do come close to this earth, but there is absence of 
data of beings that have ever landed upon this earth, unless someone will 
take up the idea that Kaspar Hauser, for instance, came to this earth from 
some other physical world. Whether spacarians have ever dredged down here or 
not, or "sniped" down here, pouncing, assailing, either wantonly, or in the 
interests of their sciences, there are data of seeming seizures and attacks 
from somewhere, and I have strong objections against lugging in the fourth 
dimension, because then I am no better off, wondering what the fifth and 
sixth are like. 

In La Nature, 1888-2-66, M. Adrian Arcelin writes that, while excavating 
near de Solutré, in August, 1878, upon a day, described as superbe, sky 
clear to a degree said to have been parfaitement, several dozen sheets of 
wrapping paper upon the ground suddenly rose.(13) Nearby were a dozen men, 
and not one of them had felt a trace of wind. A strong force had seized upon 
these conspicuous objects, touching nothing else. According to M. Arcelin, 
the dust on the ground under and around was not disturbed. The sheets of 
paper continued upward, and disappeared in the sky. 

A powerful force that swooped upon a fishing vessel, raising it so far that 
when it fell back it sank -- see London Times, Sept. 24, 1875.(14) A quarter 
of a mile away were other vessels, from which set out rescuers to the 
sailors who had been thrown into the sea. There was no wind: the rescuers 
could not use sails, but had to row their boats. 

Upon Oct. 2, 1875, a man was trundling a cart from Schaffhausen, near 
Beringen, Germany. His right arm was perforated from front to back, as if by 
a musket ball (Pop. Sci., 15-566).(15) This man had two companions. He had 
heard a whirring sound, but his companions had heard nothing. At one side of 
the road there were laborers in a field, but they were not within gunshot 
distance. Whatever the missile may have been, it was unfindable. 

La Nature, 1879-1-166, quotes the Courrier des Ardennes as to an occurrence 
in the Commune Signy-le-Pettit, Easter Sunday, 1879 -- a conspicuous, 
isolated house -- suddenly its slate roof shot into the air, and then fell 
to the ground.(16) There had not been [167/168] a trace of wind. The writer 
of the account says that the force, which he calls a trouble inoui had so 
singled out this house that nothing in its surroundings beyond a distance of 
thirty feet had been disturbed. 

Scientific American, July 10, 1880 -- that, according to the Plaindealer, of 
East Kent, Ontario, two citizens of East Kent were in a field, and heard a 
loud report.(17) They saw stones shooting upward from a field. They examined 
the spot, which was about 16 feet in diameter, finding nothing to suggest an 
explanation of the occurrence. It is said that there had been neither a 
whirlwind nor anything else by which to explain. 

It may be that witnesses have seen human beings dragged from their own 
existence either into the objectionable fourth dimension, perhaps then 
sifting into the fifth, or up to the sky by some exploring thing. I have 
data, but they are from the records of psychic research. For instance, a man 
had been seen walking along a road -- sudden disappearance. Explanation -- 
that he was not a living human being, but an apparition that had 
disappeared. I have not been able to develop such data, finding, for 
instance, that someone in the neighborhood had been reported missing; but it 
may be that we can find material in our own field. 

Upon December 10, 1881, Walter Powell and two companions ascended from Bath 
in the Government balloon Saladin (Valentine and Tomlinson, Travels in 
Space, p. 227).(18) The balloon descended at Bridport, coast of the English 
Channel. Two of the aëronauts got out, but the balloon, with Powell in it, 
shot upward. There was a report that the balloon had been seen to fall in 
the English Channel, near Bridport, but according to Capt. Temple, one of 
Powell's companions, probably something thrown from the balloon had been 
seen to fall. 

A balloon is lost near or over the sea. If it should fall into the sea it 
would probably float and for considerable time be a conspicuous object; 
nevertheless the disappearance of a balloon last seen over the English 
Channel, can not, without other circumstances, be considered very 
mysterious. Now one expects to learn of reports from many places of supposed 
balloons that had been seen. But the extraordinary circumstance is that 
reports [168/169] came in upon a luminous object that was seen in the sky at 
the time that this balloon disappeared. In the London Times, it is said that 
a luminous object had been seen, evening of the 13th, moving in various 
directions in the sky near Cherbourg. It is said that upon the night of the 
16th three customhouse guards, at Laredo, Spain, had seen something like a 
balloon in the sky, and had climbed a mountain in order to see it better, 
but that it had shot out sparks and had disappeared -- and had been reported 
from Bilbao, Spain, the next day. In the Morning Post, it is said that this 
luminous display was the chief feature; that it was this sparkling that had 
made the object visible. In the Standard, Dec. 16, is an account of 
something that was seen in the sky, five o'clock, morning of Dec. 15, by 
Capt. Mc. Bain, of the steamship Countess of Aberdeen, off the coast of 
Scotland, 25 miles from Montrose.(19) Through glasses, the object seemed to 
be a light attached to something thought to be the car of a balloon, 
increasing and decreasing in size -- a large light -- "as large as the light 
at Girdleness." It moved in a direction opposite to that of the wind, though 
possibly with wind of an upper stratum. It was visible half an hour, and 
when it finally disappeared, was moving toward Bervie, a town on the 
Scottish coast about 12 miles north of Montrose. In the Morning Post it is 
said that the explanation is simple: that someone in Monfreith, 8 miles from 
Dundee, had, late in the evening of the 15th, sent up a fire-balloon, "which 
had been carried along the coast by a gentle breeze, and, after burning all 
night, extinguished and collapsed off Montrose, early on Thursday morning 
(16th)." This story of a balloon that wafted to Montrose, and that was 
evidently traced until it collapsed near Montrose does not so simply explain 
an object that was seen 25 miles from Montrose. In the Standard, Dec. 19, it 
is said that two bright lights were seen over Dartmouth Harbor, upon the 
11th.(20) 

Walter Powell was Member of Parliament for Malmesbury, and had many friends, 
some of whom started immediately to search. His relatives offered a reward. 
A steamboat searched the Channel, and did not give up until the 13th; 
fishing vessels kept on searching. A "sweeping expedition" was organized, 
and the [169/170] coast guard was doubled, searching the shore for wreckage, 
but not a fragment of the balloon, nor from the balloon, except a 
thermometer in a bag, was found. 

In L'Astronomie, 1886-312, Prof. Paroisse of the College Bar-sur-Aube, 
quotes two witnesses of a curieux phénomène that occurred in a garden of the 
College, May, 22, 1886 -- cloudless sky; wind tres faible.(21) Within a 
small circle in the garden were some baskets and ashes and a window frame 
that weighed sixty kilogrammes. These things suddenly rose from the ground. 
At a height of about forty feet, they remained suspended several minutes, 
then falling back to the place from which they had risen. Not a thing 
outside this small circle had been touched by the seizure. The witness said 
that they felt no disturbance in the air. 

Scientific American, 56-65 -- that in June, 1886, according to the London 
Times, "a well-known official" was entering Pall Mall, when he felt a 
violent blow on the shoulder and heard a hissing sound.(22) There was no one 
in sight except a distant policeman. At home, he found that the nap of his 
coat looked as if a hot wire had been pressed against the cloth, in a long, 
straight line. No missile was found, but it was thought that something of a 
meteoritic nature had struck him. 

Charleston News and Courier, Nov. 25, 1886 -- that, at Edina, Mo., Nov. 23, 
a man and his three sons were pulling corn on a farm.(23) Nothing is said of 
meteorologic conditions, and, for all I know, they may have been pulling 
corn in a violent thunderstorm. Something that is said to have been 
lightning flashed from the sky. The man was injured slightly, one son 
killed, the other seriously injured -- the third had disappeared. "What has 
become of him is not known, but it is supposed that he was blinded or crazed 
by the shock, and wandered away." 

Brooklyn Eagle, March 17, 1891 -- that, at Wilkesbarre, Pa., March 16th, two 
men were "lifted bodily and carried considerable distance in a 
whirlwind."(24) It was a powerful force, but nothing else was affected by 
it. Upon the same day, there was an occurrence in Brooklyn. In the New York 
Times, March 17, 1891, it is said that two men, Smith Morehouse, of Orange 
Co., N.Y., and William Owen, of Sussex Co., N.J., were walking in Van- 
[170/171] derbilt Avenue, Brooklyn, about 2 o'clock, afternoon of the 16th, 
when a terrific explosion occurred close to the head of Morehouse, injuring 
him and stunning Owen, the flash momentarily blinding both.(25) Morehouse's 
face was covered with marks like powder-marks, and his tongue was pierced. 
With no one else to accuse, the police arrested Owen, but held him upon the 
technical charge of intoxication. Morehouse was taken to a hospital, where a 
splinter of metal, considered either brass or copper, but not a fragment of 
a cartridge, was removed from his tongue. No other material could be found, 
though an object of considerable size had exploded. Morehouse's hat had been 
perforated in six places by unfindable substances. According to witnesses 
there had been no one within a hundred feet of the men. One witness has seen 
the flash before the explosion, but could not say whether it had been from 
something falling or not. In the Brooklyn Eagle, March 17, 1891, it is said 
that neither of the men had a weapon of any kind, and that there had been no 
disagreement between them. According to a witness, they had been under 
observation at the time of the explosion, her attention having been 
attracted by their rustic appearance. 

There is an interesting merging here of the findable and the unfindable. I 
suppose that no one will suppose that someone threw a bomb at these men. But 
enough substance was found to exclude the notion of "lightning from a clear 
sky." Something of a meteoritic nature seems excluded. [171]

CHAPTER SIXTEEN





OUT from a round, red planet, a little white shaft -- a fairy's arrow shot 
into an apple. June 10, 1892 -- a light like a little searchlight, 
projecting from the limb of Mars. Upon July 11 and 13, it was seen again, by 
Campbell and Hussey (Nature, 50-500).(1) 

Aug. 3, 1892 -- climacteric opposition of Mars.(2) 

Upon August 12, 1892, flashes were seen by many persons, in the sky of 
England. See Eng. Mec., vol. 56.(3) At Manchester, so like signals they 
were, or so unlike anything commonly known as "auroral" were they, that 
Albert Buss mistook them for flashes from a lighthouse. They were seen at 
Dewsbury; described by a correspondent to the English Mechanic, who wrote: 
"I have never seen such an appearance of an aurora." "Rapid flashes" 
reported from Loughborough. 


* * *
A shining triangle in a dark circle. 

In L'Astronomie, 1888-75, Dr. Klein publishes an account of de Speissen's 
observation of Nov. 23, 1887 -- a luminous triangle on the floor of 
Plato.(4) Dr. Klein says it was an effect of sunlight. 

In this period, there were in cities of the United States, some of the most 
astonishing effects at night, in the history of this earth. If Rigel should 
run for the Presidency of Orion, and if the stars in the great nebula should 
start to march, there would be a spectacle like those that Grover Cleveland 
called forth in the United States, in this period. 

So then -- at least conceivably -- something similar upon the moon. Flakes 
of light moving toward Plato, this night of Nov. 23, 1887, from all the 
other craters of the moon; a blizzard of shining points gathering into 
light-drifts in Plato; then the denizens of Aristarchus and of Kepler, and 
dwellers from the lunar Alps, each raising his torch, marching upon a 
triangular path, [172/173] making the triangle shine in the dark -- 
conceivably. Other formations have been seen in Plato, but, according to my 
records, this symbol that shone in the dark had never been seen before, and 
has not been seen since. 

About two years later -- a demonstration of a more exclusive kind -- 
assemblage of all the undertakers of the moon. They stood in a circular 
formation, surrounded by virgins in their nightgowns -- and in nightgowns as 
nightgowns should be. An appearance in Plinius, Sept. 13, 1889, was reported 
by Prof. Thury, of Geneva -- a black spot with an "intensely white" border. 

March 30, 1889 -- a black spot that was seen for the first time, by 
Gaudibert, near the center of Copernicus (L'Astro., 1890-235).(5) May 11, 
1889 -- an object as black as ink upon a rampart of Gassendi (L'Astro., 
1889-275).(6) It had never been reported before; at the time of the next 
lunation, it was not seen again. March 30, 1889 -- a new black spot in 
Plinius (L'Astro., 1890-187).(7) 

The star-like object in Aristarchus -- it is a long time since latest 
preceding appearance, (May 7, 1867).(8) Then it can not be attributed to 
commonplace lunar circumstances. The light was seen Nov. 7, 1891, by M. 
d'Adjuda, of the Observatory of Lisbon -- "a very distinct, luminous point" 
(L'Astro., 11-33).(9) 

Upon April 1, 1893, a shaft of light was seen projecting from the moon, by 
M. de Moraes, in the Azores. A similar appearance was seen, Sept. 25, 1893, 
at Paris, by Mr. Gaboreau (L'Astro., 13-34).(10) 


* * *



Another association like that of 1884 -- in the English Mechanic, 55-310, a 
correspondent writes that, upon May 6, 1892, he saw a shining point (not 
polar) upon Venus.(11) Upon the 13th of August, 1892, the same object -- 
conceivably -- was seen at a short distance from Venus -- an unknown, 
luminous object, like a star of the 7th magnitude that was seen close to 
Venus, by Prof. Barnard (Ast. Nach., no. 4106).(12) 

Upon August 24, 1895, in the period of primary maximum brilliance of Venus, 
a luminous object, it is said, was seen in the sky, in day time, by someone 
in Donegal, Ireland.(13) Upon this day, according to the Scientific 
American, 73-374, a boy, Robert [173/174] Alcorn, saw a large luminous 
object falling from the sky.(14) It exploded near him. The boy's experience 
was like Smith Morehouse's. He put his hands over his face: there was a 

second explosion, shattering his fingers. According to Prof. George M. 
Minchin, no substance of the object that had exploded could be found. 
Whether there be relation or not, something was seen in the sky of England a 
week later. In the London Times, Sept. 4, 1895, Dr. J.A.H. Murray writes 
that, at Oxford, a few minutes before 8 P.M., August 31, 1895, he saw in the 
sky a luminous object, considerably larger than Venus at greater brilliance, 
emerge from behind tree tops, and sail slowly eastward.(15) It moved as if 
driven in a strong wind, and disappeared behind other trees. "The fact that 
it so perceptibly grew fainter as it receded seems to imply that it was not 
at a great elevation, and so favors a terrestrial origin, though I am unable 
to conceive how anything artificial could have presented the same 
appearance." In the Times, of the 6th, someone who had read Dr. Murray's 
letter says that, about the same time, same evening, he, in London, had seen 
the same object moving eastward so slowly that he had thought it might be a 
fire-balloon from a neighboring park.(16) Another correspondent, who had not 
read Dr. Murray's letter, his own dated Sept. 3, writes from a place not 
stated that about 8.20 P.M., Aug. 31, he had seen a star-like object, moving 
eastward, remaining in sight four or five minutes. Then someone who, about 8 
P.M., same evening, while driving to the Scarborough station, had seen "a 
large shooting star," astonishing him, because of its leisurely rate, so 
different from the velocity of the ordinary "shooting star." There are two 
other accounts of objects that were seen in the sky, at Bath and at 
Ramsgate, but not about this time, and I have looked them up in local 
newspapers, finding that they were probably meteors. 

In the Oxford Times, Sept. 7, Dr. Murray's letter to the London Times is 
reprinted, with this comment -- "We would suggest to the learned doctor that 
the supposed meteor was one of the fire-balloons let off with the allotments 
show."(17) 

Let it be that when allotments are shown, balloons are always sent up, and 
that this Editor did not merely have a notion to this effect. Our data are 
concerned with an object that was [174/175] seen, at about the same time, at 
Oxford, about 50 miles south east of Oxford, and about 170 miles northeast 
of Oxford, with a fourth observation that we can not place. 

And, in broader terms, our data are concerned with a general expression that 
objects like ships have been seen to sail close to this earth at times when 
the planet Venus is nearest this earth. Sept. 18, 1895 -- inferior 
conjunction of Venus.(18) 

Still in the same period, there were, in London, two occurrences perhaps 
like that at Donegal. London Morning Post, Nov. 16, 1895 -- that, at noon, 
Nov. 15, an "alarming explosion" occurred somewhere near Fenchurch Street, 
London.(19) No damage was done; no trace could be found of anything that had 
exploded. An hour later, near the Mansion House, which is not far from 
Fenchurch Street, occurred a still more violent explosion. The streets 
filled with persons who had run from buildings, and there was investigation, 
but not a trace could be found of anything that had exploded. It is said 
that somebody saw "something falling." However, the deadly explainers, 
usually astronomers, but this time policemen, haunt or arrest us. In the 
Daily News, though it is not said that a trace of anything that had exploded 
had been found, it is said that the explanation by the police was that 
somebody had mischievously placed in the streets fog-signals, which had been 
exploded by passing vehicles.(20) 

Observations by Müller, of Nymegen, Holland -- an unknown luminous object 
that, about three weeks later, was seen near Venus (Monthly Notices, R.A.S., 
52-276).(21) 

Upon the 28th of April, 1897, Venus was in inferior conjunction.(22) In 
Popular Astronomy, 5-55, it is said that many persons had written to the 
Editor, telling of "airships" that had been seen, about this time.(23) The 
Editor writes that some of the observations were probably upon the planet 
Venus, but that others probably related to toy balloons, "which were 
provided with various colored lights." 

The first group of our data, I take from dispatches to the New York Sun, 
April 2, 11, 16, 18.(24) First of April -- "the mysterious light" in the sky 
of Kansas City -- something like a powerful searchlight. "It is directed 
toward the earth, and is travelling east at the rate of sixty miles an 
hour." A week later, something [175/176] was seen in Chicago. "Chicago's 
alleged airship is believed to be a myth, in spite of the fact that a great 
many persons say that they have seen the mysterious night-wanderer. A crowd 
gazed at strange lights, from the top of a downtown skyscraper, and Evanston 
students declare they saw the swaying red and green lights." April 16 -- 
reported from Benton, Texas, but this time as a dark object that passed 
across the moon. Reports from other towns in Texas: Fort Worth, Dallas, 
Marshall, Ennis, and Beaumont -- "It was shaped like a Mexican cigar, large 
in the middle and small at both ends, with great wings, resembling those of 
an enormous butterfly. It was brilliantly illuminated by the rays of two 
great searchlights, and was sailing in a southeasterly direction with the 
velocity of the wind, presenting a magnificent appearance." 

New York Herald, April 11 -- that, at Chicago, night of April 9-10, "until 
two o'clock in the morning, thousands of amazed spectators declared that the 
lights seen in the northwest were those of an airship, or some floating 
object, miles above the earth....Some declare they saw two cigar-shaped 
objects and great wings."(25) It is said that a white light, a red light, 
and a green light had been seen. 

There does seem to be an association between this object and the planet 
Venus, which upon this night was less than three weeks from nearest approach 
to this earth. Nevertheless this object could not have been Venus, which had 
set hours earlier. Prof. Hough, of the Northwestern University, is quoted -- 
that the people had mistaken the star Alpha Orionis for an airship. Prof. 
Hough explains that astronomic effects may have given a changing red and 
green appearance to this star.(26) Alpha Orionis as a northern star is some 
more astronomy by the astronomers who teach astronomy daytimes and then 
relax when night comes. That atmospheric conditions could pick out this one 
star and not affect other brilliant stars in Orion is more astronomy. At any 
rate the standardized explanation that the thing was Venus disappears. 

There were other explainers -- someone who said that he knew of an airship 
(terrestrial one) that had sailed from San Francisco and had reached 
Chicago. 

Herald, April 12 -- said that the object had been photographed [176/177] in 
Chicago: "a cigar-shaped, silken bag," with a framework -- other 
explanations and identifications, not one of them applying to this object, 
if be accepted that it was seen in places as far apart as Illinois and 
Texas.(27) It is said that, upon March 29th, the thing had been seen in 
Omaha, as a bright light sailing to the northwest, and that, for a few 
moments, upon the following night, it had been seen in Denver. It is said 
that, upon the night of the 9th, despatches had bombarded the newspaper 
offices of Chicago, from many places in Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Iowa, 
and Wisconsin. 

"Prof. George Hough maintains that the object seen is Alpha Orionis." 

April 14 -- story, veritable observation, yarn, hoax -- despatch from 
Carlensville, Illinois--that upon the afternoon of the 10th, the airship had 
alighted upon a farm, but had sailed away when approached -- "cigar-shaped, 
with wings, and a canopy on top."(28) 

April 15 -- shower of telegrams -- developments of jokers and explainers -- 
thing identified as an airship invented by someone in Dodge City, Kansas; 
identified as an airship invented by someone in Brule, Wisconsin -- stories 
of letters found on farms, purporting to have been dropped by the unknown 
aëronauts (terrestrial ones) -- jokers in various towns, sending up balloons 
with lights attached -- one laborious joker who rigged up something that 
looked like an airship and put it in a vacant lot and told that it had 
fallen there -- yarn or observation, upon a "queer-looking boat" that had 
been seen to rise from the water in Lake Erie -- continued reports upon a 
moving object in the sky, and its red and green lights. 

Against such an alliance as this, between the jokers and the astronomers, I 
see small chance for our data. The chance is in the future. If, in April, 
1897, extra-mundane voyagers did visit this earth, likely enough they will 
visit again, and then the alliance against the data may be guarded against. 

New York Herald, April 20 -- that, upon the 19th, about 9 P.M., at 
Sistersville, W.Va., a luminous object had approached the town from the 
northwest, flashing brilliant red, white, and green lights.(29) "An 
examination with strong glasses left an impression of a huge [177/178] cone-
shaped arrangement 180 feet long, with large fins on either side." 

My own general impression: 

Night of October 12, 1492 -- if I have that right. Some night in October, 
1492, and savages upon an island-beach are gazing out at lights that they 
have never seen before. The indications are that voyagers from some other 
world are nearby. But the wise men explain. One of the most nearly sure 
expressions in this book is upon how they explain. They explain in terms of 
the familiar. For instance, after all that is spiritual in a fish passes 
away, the rest of him begins to shine nights. So there are three big, old, 
dead things out in the water -- [178]

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN





THERE have been published several observations upon a signal-like regularity 
of the Barisal Guns, which, because unaccompanied by phenomena that could be 
considered seismic, may have been detonations in the sky, and which, 
because, according to some hearers, they seemed to come from the sky, may 
have come from some region stationary in the local sky of Barisal. In 
Nature, 61-127, appears a report by Henry S. Schurr, who investigated the 
sounds in the years 1890-91:(1) 

"These Guns are always heard in triplets, ie. three guns are always heard, 
one after the other, at regular intervals, and, though several guns may be 
heard the number is always three or a multiple of three. Then the interval 
between the three is always constant, ie. the interval between the first and 
the second is the same as the interval between the second and the third, and 
this interval is usually three seconds, though I have heard it up to ten 
seconds. The interval, however, between the triplets varies, and varies 
largely, from a few seconds up to hours and days. Sometimes only one series 
of triplets is heard in a day; at others the triplets follow with great 
regularity, and I have counted as many as forty-five of them, one after the 
other, without pause." 

In vols. 16 and 17, Ciel et Terre, M. Van den Broeck published a series of 
papers upon the mysterious sounds that had been heard in Belgium.(2) 

July, 1892 -- heard near Brée, by Dr. Raemaekers, of Antwerp -- detonations 
at regular intervals of about 12 seconds, repeated about 20 times. 

Aug. 5, 1892 -- near Dunkirk, by Prof. Gérard, of Brussels -- four reports 
like sounds of cannons. 

Aug. 17, 1893 -- between Ostend and Ramsgate, by Prof. Gérard -- a series of 
distinct explosions -- state of the sky giving no reason to think that they 
were meteorological manifestations. [179/180] 

Sept. 5, 1893 -- at Middelkirke -- loud sounds of remarkable intensity. 

Sept. 8, 1893 -- English Channel near Dover -- by Prof. Gérard -- an 
explosive sound. 

In Ciel et Terre, 16-485, M. Van den Broeck records an experience of his 
own.(3) Upon June 25, 1894, at Louvain, he had heard detonations like 
discharges of artillery: he tabulates the intervals in a series of sounds. 
If there is signalling from some unknown region over Belgium, and not far 
from the surface of this earth, or from extra-mundane vessels, and if there 
were something of the code-like, resembling the Morse alphabet, perhaps, in 
this series of sounds, there can be small hope of interpreting such limited 
material, but there may be suggestion to someone to record all sounds and 
their intervals and modulations, if, with greater duration, such phenomena 
should ever occur again. The intervals were four minutes and twenty-three 
minutes; then three minutes, four, three quarters, three and three quarters, 
three quarters. 

Sept. 16, 1895 -- a triplet of detonations, heard by M. de Schryvere, of 
Brussels. 

There were attempts to explain. Some of M. Van den Broeck's correspondents 
thought that there had been firing from forts on the coast of England, and 
somebody thought that the phenomena should be attributed to gravitational 
effects of the moon. Upon Sept. 13, 1895, four shocks were felt and sounds 
heard at Southampton: a series of three and then another, (Nature, 52-552); 
but I have no other notes upon sounds that were heard in England at this 
time, except the two explosions that were explained by the police of 
London.(4) However, M. Van den Broeck says that Mr. Harmer, of Alderburgh, 
Suffolk, had, about the first of November, heard booming sounds that had 
been attributed to cannonading at Harwich. Mr. Harmer had heard other sounds 
that had been attributed to cannonading somewhere else. He could not offer a 
definite opinion upon the first sounds, but had investigated the others, 
learning that the attribution was a mistake.(5) 

It was M. de Schryvere's opinion that the triplet of detonations that he had 
heard was from vessels in the North Sea.(6) But now, [180/181] according to 
developments, the sounds of Belgium cannot very well be attributed to 
terrestrial cannonading in or near Belgium: in Ciel et Terre, 16-614, are 
quoted two artillery officers who had heard the sounds, but could not so 
trace them: one of these officers had heard a series of detonations with 
intervals of about two minutes.(7) A variety of explanations was attempted, 
but in conventional terms, and if these localized, repeating sounds did come 
from the sky, there's nothing to it but a new variety of attempted 
explanations, and in most unconventional terms. There are recorded definite 
impressions that the sounds were in the sky: Prof. Peleseneer's positivement 
aérien.(8) In Ciel et Terre, 17-14, M. Van den Broeck announced that General 
Hennequin, of Brussels, had co-operated with him, and had sent enquiries to 
army officers and other persons, receiving thirty replies.(9) Some of these 
correspondents had heard detonations at regular intervals. It is said that 
the sounds were like cannonading, but not in one instance were the sounds 
traced to terrestrial gunfire. 

January 24, 1896 -- a triplet of triplets -- between 2.30 and 3.30, P.M. -- 
by M. Overloop, of Middelkirke, Belgium -- three series of detonations, each 
of three sounds.(10) 

The sounds went on, but, after this occurrence, there seems to me to be 
little inducement to continue upon this subject. This is indication that 
from somewhere there has been signalling: from extra-mundane vessels to one 
another, or from some unknown region to this earth, as nearly final as we 
can hope to find. There are persons who will see nothing but a 
susceptibility to the mysticism of numbers in a feeling that there is 
significance in threes of threes. But, if there be attempt in some other 
world to attract attention upon this earth, it would have to be addressed to 
some state of mind that would feel significances. Let our three threes be as 
mystic as the eleven horns on Daniel's fourth animal; if throughout nature 
like human nature there be only superstition as to such serialization, that 
superstition, for want of something more nearly intelligent, would be a 
susceptibility to which to appeal, and from which response might be 
expected. I think that a sense of mystic significance in the number three 
may be universal, because upon this earth it is general, appearing in 
[181/182] theologies, in the balanced composition of all the arts, in 
logical demonstrations, and in the indefinite feelings that are supposed to 
be superstitious. 

The sounds went on, as if there were experiments, or attempts to communicate 
by means of other regularizations and repetitions. Feb. 18, 1896 -- a series 
of more than 20 detonations, at intervals of 2 or 3 minutes, heard at 
Ostend, by M. Pulzeys, an engineer of Brussels.(11) Four or five sounds were 
heard at Ostend by someone else: repeated upon the 21st of February.(12) 
Heard by M. Overloop, at Ostend, April 6: detonations at 11.57.30 A.M., and 
at 12.1.32 P.M. Heard the next day, by M. Overloop, at Blankenberghe, at 
2.35 and 2.51 P.M.(13) 

The last occurrence recorded by M. Van den Broeck was upon the English 
Channel.(14) May 23, 1896: detonations at 3.20 and 3.40 P.M., I have no more 
data, as to this period, myself, but I have notes upon similar sounds, by no 
means so widely reported and commented upon, in France and Belgium about 15 
years later. One notices that the old earthquake-explanation as to these 
sounds has not appeared. 

But there were other phenomena in England, in this period, and to 
considerable degree they were conventionally explained. They were not of the 
type of the Belgian phenomena, and, because manifestations were seen and 
felt, as well as heard, they were explained in terms of meteors and 
earthquakes. But in this double explanation, we meet a divided opposition, 
and no longer are we held back by the uncompromising attempt by exclusionist 
science to attribute all disturbances of this earth's surface to 
subterranean origin. The admission by Symons and Fordham that we have 
recorded, as to occurrences of 1887-89, has survived. 

The earliest of accounts that I have read of the quakes in the general 
region of Worcester and Hereford (London Triangle) that associated with 
appearances in the sky, was published by two church wardens in the years 
1661, as to occurrences of October, 1661, and is entitled, A True and 
Perfect Relation of the Terrible Earthquake.(15) It is said that monstrous 
flaming things were seen in the sky, and that phenomena below were 
interesting. We are told, "truly and perfectly," that Mrs. Margaret Petmore 
fell in labor and brought forth three male offspring all of whom [183/184] 
had teeth and spoke at birth. Inasmuch as it is not recorded what the 
infants said, and whether in plain English or not, it is not so much an 
extraordinary birth such as, in one way or another, occurs from time to 
time, that affronts our conventional notions, as it is the idea that there 
could be relation between the abnormal in obstetrics and the unusual in 
terrestrics. The conventional scientist has just this reluctance towards 
considering shocks of this earth and phenomena in the sky at the same time. 
If he could accept with us that there often has been relation, the seeming 
discord would turn into commonplace, but with us he would never again want 
to hear of extraordinary detonating meteors exploding only by coincidence 
over a part of this earth where an earthquake was occurring, or of 
concussions of this earth, time after time, in one small region, from 
meteors that, only by coincidence, happened to explode in one little local 
sky, time after time. Give up the idea that this earth moves, however, and 
coincidences many times repeated do not have to be lugged in. 

Our subject now is the supposed earthquake centering around Worcester and 
Hereford, Dec. 17, 1896; but there may have been related events, leading up 
to this climax, signifying long duration of something in the sky that 
occasionally manifested relatively to this corner of the London Triangle. 
Mrs. Margaret Petmore was too sensational a person for our liking, at least 
in our colder and more nearly scientific moments, so we shall not date so 
far back as the time of her performance; but the so-called earthquakes of 
Oct. 6, 1863, and of Oct. 30, 1868, were in this region, and we had data for 
thinking that they were said to be earthquakes only because they could not 
be traced to terrestrial explosions. 

At 5.45 P.M., Nov. 2, 1893, a loud sound was heard at a place ten miles 
northeast of Worcester, and no shock was felt (Nature, 49-245); however at 
Worcester and in various parts of the west of England and in Wales a shock 
was felt.(16) 

According to James G. Wood, writing in Symons' Met. Mag., 29-8, at 9.30 
P.M., January 25, 1894, at Llanthomas and Clifford, towns less than 20 miles 
west of Hereford, a brilliant light was seen in the sky, an explosion was 
heard, and a quake was felt.(17) Half an hour later, something else 
occurred: according to Denning (Nature, 49-325), it was in several places, 
near Hereford and Wor- [183/184] cester, supposed to be an earthquake.(18) 
But, at Stokesay Vicarage, Shropshire (Symons' Met. Mag., 29-8), was seen 
the same kind of an appearance as that which had been seen at Llanthomas and 
Clifford, half an hour before: an illumination so brilliant that for half a 
minute everything was almost as visible as by daylight.(19) 

In English Mechanic, 74-155, David Packer calls attention to "a strange 
meteoric light" that was seen in the sky, at Worcester, during the quake of 
Dec. 17, 1896, I should say that this was the severest shock felt in the 
British Isles, in the 19th century, with the exception of the shock of April 
22, 1884, in the eastern point of the London Triangle.(20) There was 
something in the sky. In Nature, 55-179, J. Lloyd Bozward writes that, at 
Worcester, a great light was seen in the sky, at the time of the shock, and 
that, in another town, "a great blaze" had been seen in the sky.(21) In 
Symons' Met. Mag., 31-180, are recorded many observations upon lights that 
were seen in the sky.(22) In an appendix to his book, The Hereford 
Earthquake of 1896, Dr. Charles Davison says that at the time of the quake 
(5.30 A.M.) there was a luminous object in the sky, and that it "traversed a 
large part of the disturbed area."(23) He says that it was a meteor, and an 
extraordinary meteor that lighted up the ground so that one could have 
picked up a pin. With the data so far considered, almost anyone would think 
that of course an object had exploded in the sky, shaking the earth 
underneath. Dr. Davison does not say this. He says that the meteor only 
happened to appear over a part of this earth where an earthquake was 
occurring "by a strange coincidence." 

Suppose that, with ordinary common sense, he had not lugged in his "strange 
coincidence," and had written that of course the shock was concussion from 
an explosion in the sky -- 

Shocks that had been felt before midnight, Dec. 17, and at 1.30 or 1.45, 2, 
3, 3.30, 4, 5, and 5.20, and then others at 5.40 or 5.45 and at 6.15 o'clock 
-- and were they, too, concussions, but fainter and from remoter explosions 
in the sky -- and why not, if of course the great shock at 5.30 o'clock was 
from a great explosion in the sky -- and by what multiplication of 
strangeness of co- [184/185] incidence could detonating meteors, or 
explosions of any other kind, so localize in the one little sky of 
Worcester, if this earth be a moving earth -- and how could their origin be 
otherwise than a fixed region nearby? 

In some minds it may be questionable that the earth could be so affected as 
it was at 5.30 A.M., Dec. 17, 1896, by an explosion in the sky.(24) Upon 
Feb. 10, 1896, a tremendous explosion occurred in the sky of Madrid: 
throughout the city windows were smashed; a wall in the building occupied by 
the American Legation was thrown down. The people of Madrid rushed to the 
streets, and there was a panic in which many were injured. For five hours 
and a half, a luminous cloud of débris hung over Madrid, and stones fell 
from the sky. 

Suppose, just at present, we disregard all the Worcester-Hereford phenomena 
except those of Dec. 17, 1896. Draw a diagram, illustrating a stream of 
meteors pursuing this earth, now supposed to be rotating and revolving, for 
more than 400,000 miles in its orbit, and curving around gracefully and 
unerringly after the rotating earth, so as to explode precisely in this 
little local sky and nowhere else. But we can't think very reasonably even 
of a flock of birds flying after and so precisely pecking one spot on an 
apple thrown in the air by somebody. Another diagram -- stationary earth -- 
bombardment of any kind one chooses to think of -- same point hit every time 
-- thinkable. 

The phenomena associate with an opposition of Mars. Dec. 10, 1896 -- 
opposition of Mars.(25) 

But we have gone on rather elaborately with perhaps an insufficiency to base 
upon. We cannot say, directly, that all the phenomena of the night Dec. 16-
17, 1896, were shocks from explosions in the sky: only during the greatest 
of the concussions was something seen, or was something near enough to be 
seen. 

We apply the idea of diagrams to another series of occurrences in this 
period. Now draw a diagram relatively to the sky of Florida, and see just 
what the explanation of coincidence demands or exacts. But then consider the 
diagram as one of the earth that does not move and of something that is 
fixed over a point upon its surface. Things can be thought of as coming down 
[185/186] from somewhere else to one special sky of this earth, as logically 
as precariously placed objects on one special window sill sometimes come 
down to a special neighbor. 

In the Monthly Weather Review, 23-57, is a report, by the Director of the 
Florida Weather Service, upon "mysterious sounds" and luminous effects in 
the sky of Florida.(26) According to investigation, these phenomena did 
occur in the sky of Florida, about noon, Feb. 7, 1895, again at 5 o'clock in 
the morning of the 8th, and again between 6 and 10 o'clock, night of the 
8th. The Editor of the Review thinks that three meteors may have exploded so 
in succession in the sky of Florida, and nowhere else, "by coincidence."

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN





CHAR me the trunk of a redwood tree. Give me pages of white chalk cliffs to 
write upon. Magnify me thousands of times, and replace my trifling 
immodesties with a titanic megalomania -- then I might write largely enough 
for our subjects. Because of accessibility and abundance of data, our 
accounts deal very much with the relatively insignificant phenomena of Great 
Britain. But our subject, if not so restricted, would be the violences that 
have screamed from the heavens, lapping up villages with tongues of fire. 
If, because of appearances in the sky, it be accepted that some of the so-
called earthquakes of Italy and South America represented relations with 
regions beyond this earth, then is accepted that some of this earth's 
greatest catastrophes have been relation with the unknown and the external. 
We have data that seem to be indications of signalling, but not unless we 
can think that foreign giants have hurled explosive mountains at this earth 
can we see such indications in all the data. 

Our data do seem to fall into two orders of phenomena: sounds of Melida, 
Barisal, and Belgium, and nothing falling from the sky, and nothing seen in 
the sky, and excellently supported observations for accepting a signal-like 
intent in intervals and groupings of sounds, at least in Barisal and 
Belgium; and the unregularized phenomena of Worcester-Hereford, Colchester, 
Comrie, and Birmingham, in which appearances are seen in the sky, or in 
which substances fall from the sky, and in which effects upon this earth, 
not noted at all in Belgium and Bengal, are great, and sometimes tremendous. 
It seems that extra-geography divides into the extra-sociologic and the 
extra-physical; and in the second type of phenomena, we suppose the data are 
of physical relations between this earth and other worlds. We think of a 
difference of potential. There were tremendous detonations in the sky at the 
times of the falls of the little black stones of Birmingham and 
Wolverhampton, and the electric manifestations, according to de- [187/188] 
scriptions in the newspapers, were extraordinary, and great volumes of water 
fell. Consequently the events were supposed to be thunderstorms. I suppose, 
myself, that they were electric storms, but electric storms that represented 
difference in potential between this earth and some region that was fixed, 
at least eleven years, over Birmingham and Wolverhampton, bringing down 
stones and volumes of water from some other world, or bringing down stones, 
and dislodging intervening volumes of water, such as we have many data for 
thinking exist in outer space, sometimes in bodies of warm or hot water, and 
sometimes as great masses, or fields, of ice. 

Let two objects be generically similar, but specifically different and a 
relation that may be known as a difference of potential, though that term is 
usually confined to electric relations, generates between them. Quite as the 
Gulf Stream -- though there are no reasons to suppose that there is such a 
Gulf Stream as one reads of -- represents a relation between bodies of water 
heated differently, given any two worlds, alike in general constitution, but 
differing, say, electrically, and given proximity, we conceive of relations 
between them other than gravitational. 



But this cloistered earth, and its monkish science -- shrinking from, 
denying, or disregarding, all data of external relations, except some one 
controlling force that was once upon a time known as Jehovah, but that has 
been re-named Gravitation -- 

That the electric exchanges that were recognized by the ancients, but that 
were anthropomorphically explained by them, have poured from the sky and 
have gushed to the sky, afferently and efferently, between this earth and 
the nearby planets, or between this mainland and its San Salvadors, and have 
been recognized by the moderns, or the neo-ancients, but have been 
meteorologically and seismologically misconstrued by them. 

When a village spouts to the sky, it is said to have been caught up in a 
cyclone: when unknown substances fall from the sky, not much of anything is 
said upon the subject. 

Lost tribes and nations that have disappeared from the face of this earth -- 
that the skies have reeked with terrestrial civilizations, spreading out in 
celestial stagnations, where their remains to this day may be. The Mayans -- 
and what became [188/189] of them? Bones of the Mayans, picked white as 
frost by space-scavengers, spread upon existence like the pseudo-breath of 
Death, crystallized on a sky-pane. Three times gaps wide and dark the 
history of Egypt -- and that these abysses were gulfed by disappearances -- 
that some of the eliminations from this earth may have been upward 
translations in functional suctions.(1) We conceive of Supervision upon this 
earth's development, but for it the names Jehovah and Allah seem old-
fashioned -- that the equivalence of wrath, but like the storms of cells 
that, in an embryonic thing, invade and destroy cartilage-cells, when they 
have outlived their usefulness, have devastated this earth's undesirables. 
Likely enough, or not quite likely enough, one of these earlier Egypts was 
populated by sphinxes, if one can suppose that some of the statuary still 
extant in Egypt were portraitures. This is good, though also not so good, 
orthodox Evolutionary doctrine -- that between types occur transitionals -- 

That Elimination and Redistribution swept an earlier Egypt with suctions -- 
because it is written, in symbols of embryonic law, that life upon this 
earth must form onward -- and the crouching sphinx on the sands of Egypt, 
blinking the mysticism of her morphologic mixtures, would perhaps detain 
forever the less interesting type that was advancing -- 

That often has Clarification destroyed transitionals, that they shall not 
hold back development. 

One conceives of their remains, to this day, wafting still in the currents 
of the sky: floating avenues of frozen sphinxes, solemnly dipping in cosmic 
undulations, down which circulate processions of Egyptian mummies. 

An astronomer upon this earth notes that things in parallel lines have 
crossed the sun. 

We offer this contribution as comparing favorably with the works of any 
other historian. We think that some of the details may need revision, but 
that what they typify is somewhere nearly acceptable. 

Latitudes and longitudes of bones, not in the sky, but upon the surface of 
this earth, Baron Toll and other explorers have, upon the surface of this 
earth, kicked their way through networks [189/190] of ribs and protrusions 
of skulls and stacks of vertebrae, as numerous as if from dead land they 
sprouted there.(2) Anybody who has read of these tracts of bones upon the 
northern coast of Siberia, and of some of the outlying islands that are 
virtually composed of bones cemented with icy sand, will agree with me that 
there have been cataclysms of which conventionality and standardization tell 
us nothing. Once upon a time, some unknown force translated, from somewhere, 
a million animals to Colorado, where their remains now form great bone-
quarries. Very largely do we express a reaction against dogmatism, and 
sometimes we are not dogmatic, ourselves. We don't know very positively 
whether at times the animal life of some other world has been swept away 
from that world or not, eventually pouring from the sky of Siberia and of 
Colorado, in some of the shockingest floods of mammoths from which spattered 
cats and rabbits, in cosmic scenery, or not. All that we can say is that 
when we turn to conventionality it is to blankness or suppression. Every now 
and then, to this day, occurs an alleged fall of blood from the sky, and I 
have notes upon at least one instance in which the microscopically examined 
substance was identified as blood. But now we conceive of intenser times, 
when every now and then a red cataract hung in the heavens like the bridal 
veil of the goddess of murder. But the science of today is a soporific like 
the idealism of Europe before the War broke out. Science and idealism -- 
wings of a vampire that lulls consciousness that might otherwise foresee 
catastrophe. Showers of frogs and showers of fishes that occur to this day -
- that they are the dwindled representatives to this day of the cataclysms 
of intenser times when the skies of this earth darkened by afferent clouds 
of dinosaurs. We conceive of intenser times, but we conceive of all times as 
being rhythmic times. We are too busy to take up alarmism, but, if Rome, for 
instance, never was destroyed by terrestrial barbarians, if we can not very 
well think of Apaches seizing Chicago, extra-mundane vandals may often have 
swooped down upon this earth, and they may swoop again; and it may be a 
comfort to us, some day, to mention in our last gasp that we told about 
this. 

History, geology, palæontology, astronomy, meteorology -- that [190/191] 
nothing short of cataclysmic thinking can break down these united walls of 
Exclusionism. 

Unknown monsters sometimes appear in the ocean. When, upon the closed system 
of normal preoccupations, a story of a sea serpent appears, it is 
inhospitably treated. To us of the wider cordialities, it has 
recommendations for kinder reception. I think that we shall be noted in 
recognitions of good works for our bizarre charities. Far back in the 
topography of the nineteenth century, Richard Proctor was almost submerged 
in an ocean of smugness, but now and then he was a little island emerging 
from the gently alternating doubts and satisfactions of his era, and by 
means of several papers upon the "sea serpent" he so protruded and gave 
variety to a dreary uniformity. Proctor reviewed some of the stories of "sea 
serpents."(3) He accepted some of them. This will be news to some 
conventionalists. But the mystery that he could not solve is their 
conceivable origin. To be sure this earth may not be round, or top-shaped, 
and may tower away somewhere, perhaps with the great Antarctic plateau at 
its foothills, to a gigantic existence commensurate throughout with sea 
monsters that sometimes reach regions unknown to us. Judging by our 
experience in other fields of research, we suspect that this earth never has 
been traversed except in conventional trade-routes and standard 
explorations. One supposes that enormous forms of life that have appeared 
upon the surface of the ocean, did not come from conditions of great 
pressure below the surface. If there is no habitat of their own, in unknown 
seas of this earth, the monsters fell from the sky, surviving for a while. 
In his day, Charles Lyell never said a more preposterous thing than this -- 
however, we have no idea that mere preposterousness is a criterion. 

Then at times the things have fallen upon land, presumably. To scientific 
minds in their present anæmia of malnutrition, we offer new nourishment. 
There are materials for a science of neo-palæontology -- as it were -- at 
least a new view of animal-remains upon this earth. Remains of monsters, 
supposed to have lived geologic ages ago, are sometimes found, not in 
ancient deposits, but upon, or near, the surface of the ground, sometimes 
barely covered. I have notes upon a great pile of bones, supposed to be the 
remains of a whale, out in open view in a western desert. [191/192] 

In the American Museum of Natural History, New York City, is the mummified 
body of a monster called a trachodon, found in Converse County, Wyoming.(4) 
It was not found upon the surface of the ground, which is bad for our 
attempts to stimulate palæontology. But the striking datum to me is that the 
only other huge mummy that I know of is another trachodon, now in the Museum 
of Frankfort.(5) If only extraordinarily would geologic processes mummify 
remains of a huge animal, doubly extraordinarily would two animals of the 
same species be so exclusively affected. One at least gives some 
consideration to the idea that these trachodons are not products of geologic 
circumstances, but were affected, in common, by other circumstances. By 
inspiration, or progressive deterioration, one then conceives of the things 
as having wafted and dried in space, finally falling to this earth. Our 
swooping vandals are relieved with showering mummies. Life is turning out to 
be interesting. 

Organic substances like life-fluids of living things have rained from the 
sky. However, it is enough for our general purposes to make acceptable 
simply that unknown substances have, in large quantities, fallen from the 
sky. That is neo-ism enough, it seems to me. I consider, myself, all such 
data relatively to this earth's stationariness or possible motions. In Ciel 
et Terre, 22-198, it is said that, about 2 P.M., June 8, 1901, a glue-like 
substance fell at Sart.(6) The story is told by an investigator, M. Michael, 
a meteorologist. He says that he saw this substance falling from the sky, 
but does not give an estimate of duration: he says that he arrived during 
the last five minutes of the shower. Editors and extra-geographers can't 
help trying to explain. The Editor of Ciel et Terre writes that, three days 
before, there had been, at Antwerp, a great fire, in which, among other 
substances, a large quantity of sugar had been burned. He asks whether there 
could be any connection. Antwerp is about 80 miles from Sart. 

Sept. 2, 1905 -- the tragedy of the space-pig: 

In the English Mechanic, 86-100, Col. Markwick writes that, according to the 
Cambrian Natural Observer, something was seen in the sky, at Llangollen, 
Wales, Sept. 2, 1905.(7) It is described as an intensely black object, about 
two miles above the earth's [192/193] surface, moving at the rate of about 
twenty miles an hour. Col. Markwick writes: "Could it have been a balloon?" 
We give Col. Markwick good rating as an extra-geographer, but of the early 
or differentiating type, a transitional, if not a sphinx: so he was not 
quite developed enough to publish the details of this object. In the 
Cambrian Natural Observer, 1905-35 -- the journal of the Astronomical 
Society of Wales -- it is said that, according to accounts in the 
newspapers, an object had appeared in the sky, at Llangollen, Wales, Sept. 
2, 1905.(8) At the schoolhouse, in Vroncysylite -- I think that's it: with 
all my credulity, some of these Welsh names look incredible to me, in my 
notes -- the thing in the sky had been examined through powerful field 
glasses. We are told that it had short wings, and flew, or moved, in a way 
described as "casually inclining sideways." It seemed to have four legs and 
looked to be about ten feet long. According to several witnesses it looked 
like a huge, winged pig, with webbed feet. "Much speculation was rife as to 
what the mysterious object could be." 

Five days later, according to a member of the Astronomical Society of Wales 
-- see Cambrian Observer, 1905-30 -- a purple-red substance fell from the 
sky, at Llanelly, Wales.(9) 

I don't know that my own attitude toward these data is understood, and I 
don't know that it matters in the least; also from time to time my own 
attitude changes: but very largely my feeling is that not much can be, or 
should be, concluded from our meagre accounts, but that so often are these 
occurrences, in our fields, reported, that several times every year there 
will be occurrences that one would like to have investigated by someone who 
believes that we have written nothing but bosh, and by someone who believes 
in our data almost religiously. It may be that, early in February, 1892, a 
luminous thing travelled back and forth, exploring for ten hours in the sky 
of Sweden. The story is copied from a newspaper, and ridiculed, in the 
English Mechanic, 55-34.(10) Upon March 7, 1893, a luminous object shaped 
like an elongated pear was seen in the sky of Val-de-la-Haye, by M. Raimond 
Coulon (L'Astro., 1893-169).(11) M. Coulon's suggestion is that the light 
may have been a signal suspended from a balloon. The signal-idea is 
interesting. [193/194] 

In the summer of 1897, several weeks after Prof. Andrée and his two 
companions had sailed in a balloon, from Amsterdam Island, Spitzbergen, it 
was reported that a balloon had been seen in British Columbia.(12) There was 
wide publicity: the report was investigated. It may be that had a 
terrestrial balloon escaped from somewhere in the United States or Canada, 
or if there had been a balloon-ascension at this time, the circumstances 
would have been reported: it may well be that the object was not Andrée's 
balloon. President Bell, of the National Geographic Society, heard of this 
object, and heard that details had been sent to the Swedish Foreign Office, 
and cabled to the American Minister, at Stockholm, for information. He 
publishes his account in the National Geographic Magazine, 9-102.(13) He was 
referred to the Swedish Consul, at San Francisco. In reply to inquiry, the 
Consul telegraphed the following data, which had been collected by the 
President of the Geographical Society of the Pacific: 

"Statement of a balloon passing over the Horse-Fly Hydraulic Mining Camp, in 
Caribou, British Columbia, 52, 20', and Longitude 120, 30' -- 

"From letters of J.B. Robson, Manager of the Caribou Mining Co., and of Mrs. 
Wm. Sullivan, the blacksmith's wife, there, and a statement of Mr. John J. 
Newsome, San Francisco, then at camp. About 2 or 3 o'clock, in the 
afternoon, between fourth and seventh of August last, weather calm and 
cloudless, Mrs. Sullivan, while looking over the Hydraulic Bank, noticed a 
round, grayish-looking object in the sky, to the right of the sun. As she 
watched, it grew larger and was descending. She saw the larger mass of the 
balloon above, and a smaller mass apparently suspended from the larger. It 
continued to descend, until she plainly recognized it as a balloon and a 
large basket hanging thereto. It finally commenced to swing violently back 
and forth, and move very fast toward the eastward and northward. Mrs. 
Sullivan called her daughter, aged 18, and about this time Mrs. Robson and 
her daughter were observing it."(14) 

If someone saw a strange fish in the ocean, we'd like to know -- what was it 
like? Stripes on him -- spots -- what? It would be unsatisfactory to be told 
over and over only that a dark body had crossed some waves. In Cosmos, n.s. 
39-356, a satisfactory [194/195] correspondent writes that, at Lille, 
France, Sept. 4, 1898, he saw a red object in the sky.(15) It was like the 
planet Mars, but was in the position of no known planet. He looked through 
his telescope, and saw a rectangular object, with a violet-colored band on 
one side of it, and the rest of it striped with black and red. He watched it 
ten minutes, during which time it was stationary; then, like the object that 
was seen at the time of the Powell-mystery, it cast out sparks and 
disappeared. 

In the English Mechanic, 75-417, Col. Markwick writes that, upon May 10, 
1902, a friend of his had seen in the sky, in South Devon, a great number of 
highly colored objects like little suns or toy balloons.(16) "Altogether 
beats me," says Col. Markwick. 

Upon March 2, 1899, a luminous object in the sky, from 10 A.M., until 4 
P.M., was reported from El Paso, Texas. Mentioned in the Observatory, 22-247 
-- supposed to have been Venus, even though Venus was then two months past 
secondary maximum brilliance.(17) That seems reasonable enough, in itself, 
but there are other data for thinking that an unknown, luminous body was at 
this time in the especial sky of the southernmost states. In the U. S. 
Weather Bureau Report (Ariz. Sec., March, 1899) it is said, at Prescott, 
Arizona, Dr. Warren E. Day had seen a luminous object, upon the 8th of 
March, "that travelled with the moon" all day, until 2 P.M.(18) It is said 
that, the day before, this object had been seen close to the moon, by Mr. G. 
O. Scott, at Tonto, Arizona. Dr. Day and Mr. Scott were voluntary observers 
for the Weather Review. This association with the moon and this localization 
of observation are puzzling. 

La Nature (Sup.) Nov. 11, 1899 -- that at Luzarches, France, upon the 28th 
of October, 1899, M. A. Garrie had seen, at 4.50 P.M., a round, luminous 
object rising above the horizon.(19) About the size of the moon.(20) He 
watched it for 15 minutes, as it moved away, diminishing to a point. It may 
be that something from external regions was for several weeks in the 
especial sky of France. In La Nature (Sup.) Dec. 16, 1899, someone writes 
that he had seen, Nov. 15, 1899, 7 P.M., at Dourite (Dordogne) an object 
like an enormous star, at times white, then red, and sometimes blue, but 
moving like a kite.(21) It was in the south. He had never seen it before. 
Someone, in the issue of December 30th, says [195/196] that, without doubt 
it was the star Formalhaut, and asks for precise position.(22) Issue of Jan. 
20, 1900 -- the first correspondent says that the object was in the 
southwest, about 35 degrees above the horizon, but moving so that the 
precise position could not be stated.(23) The kite-like motion may have been 
merely seeming motion -- object may have been Formalhaut, though 35 degrees 
above the horizon seems to me to be too high for Formalhaut -- but, then, 
like the astronomers, I'm likely at times to expose what I don't know about 
astronomy. Formalhaut is not an enormous star. Seventeen are larger.(24) 

May 1, 1908, between 8 and 9 P.M., at Vittel, France -- an object, with a 
nebulosity around it, diameter equal to the moon's, according to a 
correspondent to Cosmos, n.s., 58-535.(25) At 9 o'clock a black band 
appeared upon the object, and moved obliquely across it, then disappearing. 
The Editor thinks that the object was the planet Venus, under extraordinary 
meteorologic conditions. 

Dark obj., by Prof. Brooks, July 21, 1896 (Eng. Mec., 64-12); dark object, 
by Gathmann, Aug. 22, 1896 (Sci. Amer. Sup., 67-363); two luminous objects, 
by Prof. Swift, evidently in a local sky of California, because unseen 
elsewhere in California, Sept. 20, and one of them again, Sept. 21, 1896 
(Astro. Jour., 17-8, 103); "Waldemath's second moon," Feb. 5, 1898 (Eng. 
Mec., 67-545); unknown obj., March 30, 1908 (Observatory, 31-215); dark 
obj., Nov. 10, 1908 (Bull. Soc. Astro. de France, 23-74).(26) [196]

CHAPTER NINETEEN





COLD HARBOR, Hanover Co., Virginia -- two men in a field -- "an apparently 
clear sky." In the Monthly Weather Review, 28-29, it is said that upon Aug. 
7, 1900, two men were struck by lightning.(1) The Editor says that the 
weather map gave no indication of a thunderstorm, nor of rain, in this 
region at the time. 

In July, 1904, a man was killed on the summit of Mt. Gorgionio, near the 
Mojave desert. It is said that he was killed by lightning. Two days later, 
upon the summit of Mt. Whitney, 180 miles away, another man was killed "by 
lightning" (Ciel et Terre, 29-120).(2) 

It is said, in Ciel et Terre, 17-42, that in the year 1893, nineteen 
soldiers were marching near Bourges, France, when they were struck by an 
unknown force.(3) It is said that in known terms there is no explanation. 
Some of the men were killed, and the others struck insensible. At the 
inquest it was testified that there had been no storm, and that nothing had 
been heard. 

If there occur upon the surface of this earth pounces from blankness and 
seizures by nothings, and "sniping" with bullets of unfindable substance, we 
nevertheless hesitate to bring witchcraft and demonology into our fields. 
Our general subject now is the existence of a great deal that may be nearby, 
or temporarily nearby, ordinarily invisible, but occasionally revealed by 
special circumstances. A background of stars is not to be compared, in our 
data, with the sun for a background, as a means of revelations. We accept 
that there are sunspots, but we gather from general experience and special 
instances that the word "sunspot" is another of the standardizing terms like 
"auroral" and "meteoric" and "earthquakes." See Webb's Celestial Objects for 
some observations upon large definite obscurations called "sunspots" but 
which were as evanescent against the sun as would be islands and jungles of 
space, if intervening only a few moments between this [197/198] earth and 
the swiftly moving sun.(4) According to Webb, astronomers have looked at 
great obscurations upon the sun, have turned away, and then looked again, 
finding no trace of the phenomena. Eclipses are special circumstances, and 
rather often have large, unknown bulks been revealed by different light-
effects during eclipses. For instance, upon Jan. 22, 1898, Lieut. Blackett, 
R.N., assisting Sir Norman Lockyer, at Viziadrug, India, during the total 
eclipse of the sun, saw an unknown body between Venus and Mars (Jour. Leeds 
Astro. Soc., 1906-23).(5) We have had other instances, and I have notes upon 
still more. The photographic plate is a special condition, or sensitiveness. 
In Knowledge, 16-234, a correspondent writes that, in August, 1893, in 
Switzerland, moon-lighted night, he had exposed a photographic plate for one 
hour.(6) Upon the photograph, when developed, were seen irregular, bright 
markings, but there had been no lightning to this correspondent's 
perceptions. 

The details of the sheep-panic of Nov. 3, 1888, are extraordinary. The 
region affected was much greater than was supposed by the writer whom we 
quoted in an earlier chapter. It is said in another account in Symons' 
Meteorological Magazine, that, in a tract of land twenty-five miles long and 
eight miles wide, thousands of sheep had, by simultaneous impulse, burst 
from their bounds; and had been found the next morning, widely scattered, 
some of them still panting with terror under hedges, and many crowded into 
corners of fields.(7) See London Times, Nov. 20, 1888.(8) An idea of the 
great number of flocks affected is given by one correspondent who says that 
malicious mischief was out of the question, because a thousand men could not 
have frightened and released all these sheep. Someone else tries to explain 
that, given an alarm in one flock, it might spread to the others. But all 
the sheep so burst from their folds at about eight o'clock in the evening, 
and one supposes that many folds were far from contiguous, and one thinks of 
such contagion requiring considerable time to spread over 200 square miles. 
Something of an alarming nature and of pronounced degree occurred somewhere 
near, Reading, Berkshire, upon this evening. Also there seems to be 
something of special localization: the next year another panic occurred in 
Berkshire not far from Reading.(9) [198/199] 

I have a datum that looks very much like the revelation of a ghost-moon, 
though I think of it myself in physical terms of light-effects. In Country 
Queries and Notes, 1-138, 417, it is said that, in the sky of Gosport, 
Hampshire, night of Sept. 14, 1908, was seen a light that came as if from an 
unseen moon.(10) It may be that I can record that there was a moon-like 
object in the sky of the Midlands and the south of England, this night, and 
that, though to human eyesight, this world, island of space, whatever it may 
have been, was invisible, it was, nevertheless, revealed. Upon this evening 
of Sept. 14, 1908, David Packer, then in Northfield, Worcestershire, saw a 
luminous appearance that he supposed was auroral, and photographed it. When 
the photograph was developed, it was seen that the "auroral" light came from 
a large, moon-like object. A reproduction of the photograph is published in 
the English Mechanic, 88-211.(11) It shows an object as bright and as well-
defined as the conventionally accepted moon, but only to the camera had it 
revealed itself, and Mr. Packer had caught upon film a space-island that had 
been invisible to his eyes. It seems so, anyway. 

In Country Queries and Notes, 1-328, it is said that, upon Aug. 2, 1908, at 
Ballyconneely, Connemara coast of Ireland, was seen a phantom city of 
different-sized houses, in different styles of architecture; visible three 
hours.(12) It is said that no doubt the appearance was a mirage of some city 
far away -- far away, but upon this earth, of course. This apparition is not 
of the type that we consider so especially of our own data. The so-called 
mirages that so especially interest are interesting to us not in themselves, 
but in that they belong to the one order of phenomena or evidence that 
unifies so many fields of our data: that is, repetitions in a local sky, 
signifying the fixed position of something relatively to a small part of 
this earth's surface. We can not think that mirages, terrestrial or extra-
terrestrial, could so repeat. But if in the local sky of this earth there be 
a fixed region, perhaps not a city, but something of rugged and featureful 
outlines, with projections that might look architectural, reflections from 
it, shadows, or Brocken spectres repeating always in one special sky are 
thinkable except by the Chinese-minded who regard all our data as "foreign 
devils." The writer in Country [199/200] Queries and Notes says -- 
"Circumstantial accounts have been published of the city of Bristol being 
distinctly recognized in a mirage seen occasionally in North America." If we 
shall accept that anywhere in North America repeated representations of the 
same city or city-like scene have appeared in the same local sky, I prefer, 
myself, a foreign devil of thought, and its significance, whether hellish or 
not, that this earth is stationary, to such a domestic vagrant of a thought 
as the idea that mirage could so pick out the city of Bristol, or any other 
city, over and over, and also invariably pick out for its screen the same 
local sky, thousands of miles, or five miles away. 

In the English Mechanic, Sept. 10, 1897, a correspondent to the Weekly Times 
and Echo is quoted.(13) He had just returned from the Yukon. Early in June, 
1897, he had seen a city pictured in the sky of Alaska. "Not one of us could 
form the remotest idea in what part of the world this settlement could be. 
Some guessed Toronto, others Montreal, and one of us even suggested Pekin. 
But whether this city exists in some unknown world on the other side of the 
North Pole, or not, it is a fact that this wonderful mirage occurs from time 
to time yearly, and we were not the only ones who witnessed the spectacle. 
Therefore it is evident that it must be the reflection of some place built 
by the hand of man." According to this correspondent, the "mirage" did not 
look like one of the cities named, but like "some immense city of the past." 

In the New York Tribune, Feb. 17, 1901, it is said that Indians of Alaska 
had told of an occasional appearance, as if of a city, suspended in the sky, 
and that a prospector named Willoughby, having heard the stories, had 
investigated, in the year 1887, and had seen the spectacle.(14) It is said 
that, having several times attempted to photograph the scene, Willoughby did 
finally at least show an alleged photograph of an aërial city. In Alaska, p. 
140, Miner Bruce say that Willoughby, one of the early pioneers in Alaska, 
after whom Willoughby Island is named, had told him of the phenomenon, and 
that, early in 1889, he had accompanied Willoughby to the place over which 
the mirage was said to repeat.(15) It seems that he saw nothing himself, but 
he quotes a member of the Duc d'Abruzzi's expedition to Mt. St. [200/201] 
Elias, summer of 1897, Mr. C.W. Thornton, of Seattle, who saw the spectacle, 
and wrote -- "It required no effort of the imagination to liken it to a 
city, but was so distinct that it required, instead, faith to believe that 
it was not in reality a city." Bruce publishes a reproduction of 
Willoughby's photograph, and says that the city was identified as Bristol, 
England. So definite, or so un-mirage-like, is this reproduction, trees and 
many buildings shown in detail, that one supposes that the original was a 
photograph of a good-sized terrestrial city, perhaps Bristol, England. 

In Chapter 10, of his book, Wonders of Alaska, Alexander Badlam tries to 
explain. He publishes a reproduction of Willoughby's photograph: it is the 
same as Bruce's, except that all buildings are transposed, or are negative 
in positions.(16) Badlam does not like to accuse Willoughby of fraud: his 
idea is that some unknown humorist had sold Willoughby a dry plate, 
picturing part of the city of Bristol. My own idea is that something of this 
kind did occur, and that this photograph, greatly involved in accounts of 
repeating mirages, had nothing to do with mirages. Badlam then tells of 
another photograph. He tells that two men, near the Muir Glacier, had, by 
means of a pan of quicksilver, seen a reflection of an unknown city 
somewhere, and that their idea was that it was at the bottom of the sea near 
the glacier, reflecting in the sky, and reflecting back to and from the 
quicksilver. That's complicated. A photographer named Taber then announced 
that he had photographed this scene, as reflected in a pan of 
quicksilver.(17) Badlam publishes a reproduction of Taber's photograph, or 
alleged photograph. This time, for anybody who prefers to think that there 
is, somewhere in the sky of Alaska, a great, unknown city, we have a most 
agreeable photograph: exotic-looking city; a structure like a coliseum, and 
another prominent building like a mosque, and many indefinite, mirage-like 
buildings. I'd like to think this photograph genuine, myself, but I do 
conceive that Taber could have taken it photographing a panorama that he had 
painted. Badlam's explanation is that mirages of glaciers are common, in 
Alaska, and that they look architectural. Some years ago, I read five or six 
hundred pounds of literature upon the Arctic, and I should say that far-
projected mirages are not common in the Arctic: mere [201/202] looming is 
common. Badlam publishes a photograph of a mirage of Muir Glacier. The 
looming points of ice do look Gothic, but they are obviously only loomings, 
extending only short distances from primaries, with no detachments from 
primaries, and not reflecting in the sky. 

For the first identification of the Willoughby photograph as a photograph of 
part of the city of Bristol, see the New York Times, Oct. 20, 1889.(18) That 
this photograph was somebody's hoax seem to be acceptable. But it is not 
similar to the frequently reported scene in the sky of Alaska, according to 
descriptions. In the New York Times, Oct. 31, 1889, is an account, by Mr. 
L.B. French, of Chicago, of the spectral representation, as he saw it, near 
Mt. Fairweather.(19) "We could see plainly houses, well-defined streets, and 
trees. Here and there rose tall spires over huge buildings, which appeared 
to be ancient mosques or cathedrals....It did not look like a modern city -- 
more like an ancient European City."(20) 

Jour. Roy. Met. Soc., 27-158:(21) 

That, every year, between June 21 and July 10, a "phantom city" appears in 
the sky, over a glacier in Alaska; that features of it had been recognized 
as buildings in the city of Bristol, England, so that the "mirage" was 
supposed to be a mirage of Bristol. It is said that for generations these 
repeating representations had been known to the Alaskan Indians, and that, 
in May, 1901, a scientific expedition from San Francisco would investigate. 
It is said that, except for slight changes, from year to year, the scene was 
always the same. 

La Nature, 1901-1-303:(22) 

That a number of scientists had set out from Victoria, B.C., to Mt. 
Fairweather, Alaska, to study the repeating mirage of a city in the sky, 
which had been reported by the Duc d'Abruzzi, who had seen it and sketched 
it. [202]

CHAPTER TWENTY





NIGHT of Dec. 7, 1900 -- for seventy minutes a fountain of light played upon 
the planet Mars. 

Prof. Pickering -- "absolutely inexplicable" (Sci. Amer., 84-179).(1) 

It may have been a geyser of messages. It may be translated some day. If it 
were expressed in imagery befitting the salutation by a planet to its 
dominant, it may be known some day as the most heroic oration in the 
literature of the geo-system. See Lowell's account in Popular Astronomy, 10-
187.(2) Here are published several of the values in a possible code of long 
flashes and short flashes. Lowell takes a supposed normality for unity, and 
records variations of two thirds, one and one third, and one and a half. If 
there be, at Flagstaff, Arizona, records of all the long flashes and short 
flashes that were seen, for seventy minutes, upon this night of Dec. 7, 
1900, it is either that the greetings of an island of space have been 
hopelessly addressed to a continental stolidity, or there will have to be 
the descent, upon Flagstaff, Arizona, by all the amateur Champollions of 
this earth, to concentrate in one deafening buzz of attempted translation. 

It was at this time that Tesla announced that he had received, upon his 
wireless apparatus, vibrations that he 

attributed to the Martians. They were series of triplets. 




* * *



It is our expression that, during eclipses and oppositions and other notable 
celestial events, lunarians try to communicate with this earth, having a 
notion that at such times the astronomers of this earth may be more nearly 
alert. 

An eclipse of the moon, March 10-11, 1895 -- not a cloud; no mist -- 
electric flashes like lightning, reported from a ship upon the Atlantic 
(Eng. Mec., 61-100).(3) 

During the eclipse of the sun, July 29, 1897, a strange image [203/204] was 
taken on a sensitive plate, by Mr. L.E. Martindale, of St. Mary's, Ohio. It 
looks like a record of knotted lightning. See Photography, May 26, 1898.(4) 

In the Bull. Soc. Astro. de France, 17-205, 315, 447, it is said that upon 
the first and the third of March, 1903, a light like a little star, flashing 
intermittently, was seen by M. Rey, in Marseilles, and by Maurice Gheury, in 
London, in the lunar crater Aristarchus.(5) March 28, 1903 -- opposition of 
Mars. 




* * *



In Cosmos, n.s. 49-259, M. Desmoulins writes, from Argenteuil, that upon 
August 9, 1903, at 11 P.M., moving from north to south, he saw a luminous 
object.(6) The planet Venus was at primary greatest brilliance upon August 
13, 1903. In three respects it was like other objects that have been 
observed upon this earth at times of the nearest approach of Venus: it was a 
red object; it appeared only in a local sky, and it appeared in the time of 
the visibility of Venus. With M. Desmoulins were four persons, one of whom 
had field glasses. The object was watched twenty minutes, during which time 
it travelled a distance estimated at five or six kilometres. It looked like 
a light suspended from a balloon, but, through glasses, no outline of a 
balloon could be seen, and there were no reflections of light as if from the 
opaque body of a balloon. It was a red body, with greatest luminosity in its 
nucleus. The Editor of Cosmos writes that, according to other 
correspondents, this object had been seen, at 11 P.M., July 19th and 26th, 
at Chatou. Argenteuil and Chatou are 4 or 5 miles apart, and both are about 
5 miles from Paris. All three of these dates were Sundays, and even though 
nothing like a balloon had been seen through glasses, one naturally supposes 
that somebody near Paris had been amusing himself sending up fire-balloons, 
Sunday evenings. The one great resistance to all that is known as progress 
is what one "naturally supposes." 

In the English Mechanic, 81-220, Arthur Mee writes that several persons, in 
the neighborhood of Cardiff, had, upon the night of March 29, 1905, seen in 
the sky, "an appearance like a vertical beam of light, which was not due 
(they say) to a search light, or any such cause."(7) There were other 
observations, and they remind us of the observations of Noble and Bradgate, 
Aug. 28-29, 1883: [204/205] then upon an object that cast a light like a 
searchlight; this time an association between a light like a searchlight, 
and a luminosity of definite form. In the Cambrian Natural Observer, 1905-
32, are several accounts of a more definite-looking appearance that was 
seen, this night, in the sky of Wales -- "like a long cluster of stars, 
obscured by a thin film or mist."(8) It was seen at the time of the 
visibility of Venus, then an "evening star" -- about 10 P.M. It grew 
brighter, and for about half an hour looked like an incandescent light. It 
was a conspicuous and definite object, according to another description -- 
"like an iron bar, heated to an orange-colored glow, and suspended 
vertically." 

Three nights later, something appeared in the sky of Cherbourg, France -- 
L'Astre Cherbourg -- the thing that appeared, night after night, in the sky 
of the city of Cherbourg, at a time when the planet Venus was nearest 
(inferior conjunction April 26, 1905). 

Flammarion, in the Bull. Soc. Astro. de France, 19-243, says that this 
object was Venus.(9) He therefore denies that it had moved in various 
directions, saying that the supposed observations to this effect were 
illusions. In L'Illustration, April 22, 1905, he tells the story in his own 
way, and says some things that we are not disposed to agree with, but he 
also says that the ignorance of some persons is inénarrable.(10) In Cosmos, 
n.s., 42-420, months after the occurrence, it is said that many 
correspondents had written to inquire as to L'Astre Cherbourg.(11) The 
Editor gives his opinion that the object was either Jupiter or Venus. 
Throughout our Venus-visitor expression, the most important point is 
appearance in a local sky. That unifies this expression with other 
expressions, all of them converging into our general extra-geographic 
acceptances. The Editor of Cosmos says that this object, which was reported 
from Cherbourg, was reported from other towns as well. He probably means to 
say that it was seen simultaneously in different towns. For all guardians of 
this earth's isolation, this is a convenient thing to say: the conclusion 
then is that the planet Venus, exceptionally bright, was attracting unusual 
attention generally, and that there was nothing in the especial sky of 
Cherbourg. But we have learned that standardizing disguisements often 
obscure our data in later accounts, and we have formed the habit of going to 
contemporane- [205/206] ous sources. We shall find that the newspapers of 
the time reported a luminous object that appeared, night after night, only 
over the city of Cherbourg, as the name by which it was known indicates. It 
was a reddish object. The Editor of Cosmos explains that atmospheric 
conditions could give this coloration to Venus. I suppose this could be so 
occasionally: not night after night, I should say. We shall find that this 
object, or a similar object, was reported from other places, but not 
simultaneously with its appearance over Cherbourg. 

In the Journal des Debats, the first news is in the issue of April 4, 
1905.(12) It is said that a luminous body was appearing, every evening, 
between 8 and 10 o'clock, over the city of Cherbourg. 

These were about the hours of the visibility of Venus. In this period, Venus 
set at 9:30 P.M., and Jupiter at 8 P.M. It is enough to make any 
conventionalist feel most reasonable, though he'd feel that way anyway, in 
thinking that of course then this object was Venus. In my own earlier 
speculations upon this subject, this one datum stood out so that had it not 
been for other data, I'd have abandoned the subject. But then I read of 
other occurrences: time after time has something been seen in the local sky 
of this earth, sometimes so definitely seen to move, not like Venus, but in 
various directions, that one has to think that it was not Venus, though 
appearing at the time of visibility of Venus. Between these appearances and 
visibility of Venus there does seem to be relation. 

In the Journal, it is said that L'Astre Cherbourg had an apparent diameter 
of 15 centimetres, and a less definite margin of 75 centimetres -- seemed to 
be about a yard wide -- meaningless of course. In the Bull. Soc. Astro. de 
France, it is said that, according to reports, its form was oval.(13) In the 
Journal des Debats, we are told that, at first the thing was supposed to be 
a captive balloon but that this idea was given up because it appeared and 
disappeared. 

Journal des Debats, April 12:(14) 

That every evening the luminous object was continuing to appear above 
Cherbourg; that many explanations had been thought of: by some persons that 
it was the planet Jupiter, and by others [206/207] that it was a comet but 
that no one knew what it was. The comet-explanation is of course ruled out. 
The writer in the Journal expresses regret that neither the Meteorological 
Bureau nor the Observatory of Paris had sent anybody to investigate, but 
says that the préfet maritime, of Cherbourg had commissioned a naval officer 
to investigate. In Le Temps, of the 12th, is published an interview with 
Flammarion, who complains some more against general inénarrable-ness, and 
says that of course the object was Venus. The writer in Le Temps says that 
soon would the matter be settled, because the commander of a war ship had 
undertaken to decide what the luminous body was.(15) 

Le Figaro, April 13:(16) 

The report of Commander de Kerillis, of the Chasseloup-Laubut -- that the 
position of L'Astre Cherbourg was not the position of Venus, and that the 
disc did not look like the crescentic disc of Venus, but that observations 
had been made from a vessel, under unfavorable conditions, and that the 
commander and his colleagues did not offer a final opinion. 

I think that there was inénarrable-ness all around. Given visibility, I 
can't think what the unfavorable conditions could have been. Given, however, 
observations upon something that all astronomers in the world would say 
could not be, one does think of the dislike of a naval officer, who, though 
he probably knew right ascension from declination, was himself no 
astronomer, to commit himself. In Le Temps, and other newspapers published 
in Paris, it is said that, according to the naval officers, the object might 
have been a comet, but that they would not positively commit themselves to 
this opinion, either. 

I think that somebody should be brave; so, though not positively, of course, 
I incline, myself, to relate these appearances over Cherbourg with the 
observations in Wales, upon March 29th; also I suggest that there is another 
report that may relate. In Le Temps, April 12, it is said that, at midnight, 
April 9-10, a luminous body, like L'Astre Cherbourg, was seen in the sky of 
Tunis.(17) Though it was visible several minutes, it is said that this 
object was probably a meteor. 

Every night, from the first to the eleventh of April, a luminous body 
appeared in the sky of Cherbourg. Then it was seen no [207/208] longer. It 
may have been seen sailing away, upon its final departure from the sky of 
Cherbourg. In Le Figaro, April 15, it is said that, upon the night of the 
eleventh of April, the guards of La Blanche Lighthouse had seen something 
like a lighted balloon in the sky.(18) Supposing it was a balloon, they had 
started to signal to it, but it had disappeared. It is said that the 
lighthouse had been out of communication with the mainland, and that the 
guards had not heard of L'Astre Cherbourg.

In the London Times, Nov. 23, 1905, a correspondent writes that, at East 
Liss, Hants., which is about 40 miles from Reading, he and his gamekeeper 
had, about 3.30 P.M., Nov. 17th, heard a loud, distant rumbling.(19) 
According to this hearer, the rumbling seemed to be a composition of 
triplets of sound. We shall accept that three sounds were heard, but we have 
no other assertion that each sound was itself so sub-serialized. This 
correspondent's gamekeeper said he had heard similar sounds at 11.30 A.M., 
and at 1.30 P.M. It is said that the sounds were not like gunfire, and that 
the direction from which they seemed to come, and the time in the afternoon, 
precluded the explanation of artillery-practice at Aldershot or Portsmouth. 
Aldershot is about 15 miles from East Liss, and Portsmouth about 20. 

Times, Nov. 24 -- that the "quake" had been distinctly felt in Reading, 
about 3.30 P.M., Nov. 17th.(20) Times, Nov. 25 -- heard at Reading, at 
11.30, 1.30, and 3.30 o'clock, Nov. 17th.(21) 

Reading Standard, Nov. 25:(22) 

That consternation had been caused in Reading, upon the 17th, by sounds and 
vibrations of the earth, about 11.30 A.M., 1.30 P.M., and 3.30 P.M. It is 
said that nothing had been seen, but that the sounds closely resembled those 
that had been heard during the meteoric shower of 1866. 

Mr. H.G. Fordham appears again. In the Times, Dec. 1, he writes that the 
phenomena pointed clearly to an explosion in the sky, and not to an 
earthquake of subterranean origin.(23) "The noise and shock experienced are 
no doubt attributable to the explosion (or to more than one explosion) of a 
meteorite, or bolide, high up in the atmosphere, and setting up a wave (or 
waves) of sound and aërial shock. It is probable, indeed, that a good many 
[208/209] phenomena having this source are wrongly ascribed to slight and 
local earthshock." 

Mr. Fordham wrote this, but he wrote no more, and I think that somewhere 
else something else was written, and that, in the year 1905, it had to be 
obeyed; and that it may be interpreted in these words -- "Thou shalt not." 
Mr. Fordham did not inquire into the reasonableness of thinking that, only 
by coincidence, meteors so successively exploded, in a period of four hours, 
in one local sky of this earth, and nowhere else; and into the inference, 
then, as to whether this earth is stationary or not. 

We have data of a succession occupying far more than four hours. 

In the Times, Mrs. Lane of Petersfield, 20 miles from Portsmouth, writes 
that, at 11.30 A.M., and at 3.30 P.M., several days before the 17th, she had 
heard detonations, then hearing them again, upon the 17th. Mrs. Lane thinks 
that there must have been artillery-practice at Portsmouth. It seems clear 
that there was no cannonading anywhere in England, at this time. It seems 
clear that there was signalling from some other world. 

In the English Mechanic, 82-433, Joseph Clark writes that, a few minutes 
past 3 P.M., upon the 18th a triplet of detonations was heard at Somerset -- 
"as loud as thunder, but not exactly like thunder."(24) 

Reading Observer, Nov. 25 -- that, according to a correspondent, the sounds 
had been heard again, at Whitechurch (20 miles from Reading) upon the 21st, 
at 1.35 P.M., and 3.8 P.M.(25) The sounds had been attributed to artillery-
practice at Aldershot, but the correspondent had written to the artillery 
commandant, at Bulford Camp, and had received word that there had been no 
heavy firing at the times of his inquiry. The Editor of the Observer says 
that he, too, had written to the commandant, and had received the same 
answer. 

I have searched widely. I have found record of nobody's supposition that he 
had traced these detonations to origin upon this earth.(26) [209]

CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE





IN Coconino County, Arizona, is an extraordinary formation. It is known as 
Coon Butte and as Crater Mountain. Once upon a time, something gouged this 
part of Arizona. The cavity in the ground is about 3,800 feet in diameter, 
and it is approximately 600 feet deep, from the rim of the ramparts to the 
floor of the interior. Out from this cavity had been hurled blocks of 
limestone, some of them a mile or so away, some of these masses weighing 
probably 5,000 tons each. And in the formation, and around it, have been 
found either extraordinary numbers of meteorites, or fragments of one super-
meteorite. Barringer, in his report to the Academy of Natural Science of 
Philadelphia (Proceedings A.N.S.P., Dec., 1905), says that, of the 
traffickers in this meteoritic material, he knew of two men who had shipped 
away fifteen tons of it.(1) But Barringer's minimum estimate of a body large 
enough so to gouge the ground is ten million tons. 

It was supposed that a main mass of meteoritic material was buried under the 
floor of the formation, but this floor was drilled, and nothing was found to 
support this supposition. One drill went down 1020 feet, going through 100 
feet of red sandstone, which seems to be the natural, undisturbed sub-
structure. The datum that opposes most strongly the idea that this pit was 
gouged by one super-meteorite is that in it and around it at least three 
kinds of meteorites have been found: they are irons, masses of iron-shale, 
and shale-balls that are so rounded and individualized that they cannot be 
thought of as fragments of a greater body, and cannot be very well thought 
of as great drops of molten matter cast from a main, incandescent mass, 
inasmuch as there is not a trace of igneous rock such as would mark such 
contact. 

There are data for thinking that these three kinds of objects fell at 
different times, presumably from origin of fixed position relatively to this 
point in Arizona. With the formation, shales [210/211] were found, buried at 
various distances, as if they had fallen at different times, for instance 
seven of them in a vertical line, the deepest buried 27 feet down; also 
shales outside the formation were found buried. But, quite as if they had 
fallen more recently, the hundreds of irons were found upon the surface of 
the ground, or partly covered, or wholly covered, but only with superficial 
soil. 

There is no knowing when this great gouge occurred, but cedars upon the rim 
are said to be 700 years old. 

In terms of our general expression upon differences of potential, and of 
electric relations between nearby worlds, I think of a blast between this 
earth and a land somewhere else, and of something that was more than a 
cyclone that gouged this pit. 

Other meteorites have been found in Arizona: the 85-pound iron that was 
found at Weaver, near Wickenburg, 130 miles from Crater Mountain, in 1898, 
and the 960-pound mass, now in the National Museum, said to have been found 
at Peach Springs, 140 miles from Crater Mountain. These two irons indicate 
nothing in particular; but, if we accept that somewhere else in Arizona 
there is another deposit of meteorites, also extraordinarily abundant, such 
abundance gives something of commonness of nature if not of commonness of 
origin to two deposits. There are several large irons known as the Tucson 
meteorites, one weighing 632 pounds and another 1514 pounds, now in museums. 
They came from a place known as Iron Valley, in the Santa Rita Mountains, 
about 30 miles south of Tucson, and about 200 miles from the Crater 
Mountain. Iron Valley was so named because of the great number of meteorites 
found in it. According to the people of Tucson, this fall occurred about the 
year 1660. See Amer. Jour. Sci., 2-13-290.(2) 

Upon June 24, 1905, Barringer found, upon the plain, about a mile and a half 
northwest of Crater Mountain, a meteorite of a fourth kind. It was a 
meteoritic stone, "as different from all the other specimens as one specimen 
could be from another." Barringer thinks that it fell, about the 15th of 
January, 1904. Upon a night in the middle of January, 1904, two of his 
employees were awakened by a loud hissing sound, and saw a meteor falling 
north of the formation. At the same time, two Arizona [211/212] physicians, 
north of the formation, saw the meteor falling south of them. For analysis 
and description of this object, see Amer. Jour. Sci., 4-21-353.(3) 
Barringer, who believes that once upon a time one super-meteorite, of which 
only a very small part has ever been found, gouged this hole in the ground, 
writes -- "That a small stony meteorite should have fallen on almost exactly 
the same spot on this earth's surface as the great Canon Diablo iron 
meteorite fell many centuries ago, is certainly a most remarkable 
coincidence. I have stated the facts as accurately as possible, and I have 
no opinion to offer, as to whether or not these involve anything more than a 
coincidence."(4) 

Other phenomena in Arizona: 

Upon Feb. 24, 1897, a great explosion was heard over the town of Tombstone. 
It is said that a fragment of a meteor fell at St. David (Monthly Weather 
Review, 1897-56).(5) Yarnell, Arizona, Sept. 12, 1898 -- "a loud, deep, 
thundering noise" that was heard between noon and 1 P.M. "The noise 
proceeded from the Granite Range, this side of Prescott. From all accounts, 
a large meteor struck the earth at this time" (U.S. Weather Bureau Rept., 
Ariz. Section, Sept., 1898).(6) 

Upon July 19, 1912, at Holbrook, Arizona, about 50 miles from Crater 
Mountain, occurred a loud detonation and one of the most remarkable falls of 
stones recorded. See Amer. Jour. Sci., 4-34-437.(7) Some of the stones are 
very small. About 14,000 were collected. Only twice, since the year 1800, 
have stones in greater numbers fallen from the sky to this earth, according 
to conventional records. 

About a month later (Aug. 18) there was another concussion at Holbrook. This 
was said to be an earthquake (Bull. Seis. Soc. Amer., 1-209).(8) [212]

CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO





THE climacteric opposition of Mars, of 1909 -- the last in our records -- 
the next will be in 1924 --(1) 

Aug. 8, 1909 -- see Quar. Jour. Met. Soc., n.s., 35-299 -- flashes in a 
clear sky that were seen in Epsom, Surrey, and other places in the southeast 
of England.(2) They could not be attributed to lightning in England. The 
editor in the Journal finds that there was a storm in France, more than one 
hundred miles away,(3) For an account of these flashes, tabulated at Epsom -
- "night fine and starlight" -- Symons' Met. Mag., 44-148.(4) During each 
period of five minutes, from 10 to 11.15, P.M., the number of flashes-- 16-
14-20-31-15-26-12-20-30-18-27-22-14-12-10-21-8-5-3-1-0-1-0. With such a 
time-basis, I can see no possibility of detecting anything of a code-like 
significance. I do see development. There were similar observations at times 
in the favorable oppositions of Mars of 1875 and 1877. In 1892, such flashes 
were noted more particularly. Now we have them noted and tabulated, but upon 
a basis that could be of interest only to meteorologists. If they shall be 
seen in 1924, we may have observation, tabulation, and some marvellously 
different translations of them. After that there will be some intolerably 
similar translations, suspiciously delayed in publication. 

Sept. 23, 1909 -- opposition of Mars. 

Throughout our data, we have noticed successions of appearances in local 
skies of this earth, that indicate that this earth is stationary, but that 
also relate to nearest approaches of Mars. Upon the night of Dec. 16-17, 
1896, concussion after concussion was felt at Worcester, England; a great 
"meteor" was seen at the time of the greatest concussion. Mars was seven 
days past opposition.(5) We thought it likely enough that explosion after 
explosion had occurred over Worcester, and that something in the sky had 
been seen only at the time of the greatest, or the nearest, [213/214] 
explosion. We did not think well of the conventional explanation that only 
by coincidence had a great meteor exploded over a region where a series of 
earthquakes was occurring, and exactly at the moment of the greatest of 
these shocks. 

In November, 1911, Mars was completing his cycle of changing proximities of 
a duration of fifteen years, and was duplicating the relationship of the 
year 1896. About 10 o'clock, night of Nov. 16, 1911, a concussion that is 
conventionally said to have been an earthquake occurred in Germany and 
Switzerland. But plainly there was an explosion in the sky. In the Bulletin 
of the Seismological Society of America, 3-189, Count Montessus de Ballore 
writes that he had examined 112 reports upon flashes and other luminous 
appearances in the sky that had preceded the "earthquake" by a few 
seconds.(6) He concludes that a great meteor had only happened to explode 
over a region where, a few seconds later, there was going to be an 
earthquake. "It therefore seems highly probable that the earthquake 
coincided with a fall of meteors or shooting stars." 

The duplication of the circumstances of Dec., 1896, continues. If of course 
this concussion in Germany and Switzerland was the effect of something that 
had exploded in the sky -- of what were the concussions that were felt 
later, the effects? De Ballore does not mention anything that occurred 
later. But, a few minutes past midnight, and then again, at 3 o'clock, 
morning of the 17th, there were other, but slighter, shocks. Only at the 
time of the greatest shock was something seen in the sky. Nature, 88-117 -- 
that this succession of phenomena did occur.(7) We relate the phenomena to 
the planet Mars, but also we ask -- how, if most reasonably, all three of 
these shocks were concussions from explosions in the sky, if of course one 
of them was, meteors could ever so hound one small region upon a moving 
earth, or projectiles be fired with such specialization and preciseness? 
November 17th, 1911 was seven days before the opposition of Mars. Though the 
opposition occurred upon the 24th of November, Mars was at minimum distance 
upon the 17th. 

No matter how difficult of acceptance our own notions may be, they are 
opposed by this barbarism, or puerility, or pill that can't be digested: 
[214/215] 

Seven days from the opposition of Mars, in 1896, a great meteor exploded 
over a region where there had been a succession of earthquakes -- by 
coincidence; 

Seven days from the next similar opposition of Mars, a great meteor exploded 
over a region where there was going to be a succession of earthquakes -- by 
coincidence.

The Advantagerians of the moon -- that is the cult of lunar 
communicationists, who try to take advantage of such celestial events as 
oppositions and eclipses, thinking that astronomers, or night watchmen, or 
policemen of this earth might at such times look up at the sky -- 

A great luminous object, or a meteor, that was seen at the time of the 
eclipse of June 28, 1908 -- "as if to make the date of the eclipse more 
memorable," says W.F. Denning (Observatory, 31-288).(8) 

Not long before the opposition of Mars, in 1909, the bright spot west of 
Picard was seen twice: March 26 and May 23 (Jour. B.A.A., 19-376).(9) 

Nov. 16, 1910 -- an eclipse of the moon, and a "meteor" that appeared, 
almost at the moment of totality (Eng. Mec., 92-430).(10) It is reported, in 
Nature, 85-118, as seen by Madame de Robeck, at Naas, Ireland, "from an 
apparent radiant just below the eclipsed moon."(11) The thing may have come 
from the moon. Seemingly with the same origin, it was seen far away in 
France. In La Nature, Nov. 26, 1910, it is said that, at Besançon, France, 
during the eclipse, was seen a meteor like a superb rocket, "qui serait 
partie de la lune."(12) There may have been something occurring upon the 
moon at the time. In the Jour. B.A.A., 21-100, it is said that Mrs. Albright 
had seen a luminous point upon the moon throughout the eclipse.(13) 




* * *



Our expression is that there is an association between reported objects, 
like extra-mundane visitors, and nearest approaches by the planet Venus to 
this earth. Perhaps unfortunately this is our expression, because it makes 
for more restriction than we intend. The objects, or the voyagers, have 
often been seen during the few hours of visibility of Venus, when the planet 
is near- [215/216] est. "Then such an object is Venus," say the astronomers. 
If anybody wonders why, if these seeming navigators can come close to this 
earth -- as they do approach, if they appear only in a local sky -- they do 
not then come all the way to this earth, let him ask a sea captain why said 
captain never purposely descends to the bottom of the ocean, though 
travelling often not far away. However, I conceive of a great variety of 
extra-mundanians, and I am now collecting data for a future expression -- 
that some kinds of beings from outer space can adapt to our conditions, 
which may be like the bottom of a sea, and have been seen, but have been 
supposed to be psychic phenomena. 

Upon Oct. 31, 1908, the planet Venus was four months past inferior 
conjunction, and so had moved far from nearest approach, but there are vague 
stories of strange objects that had been seen in the skies of this earth -- 
localized in New England -- back to the time of nearest approach. In the New 
York Sun, Nov. 1, 1908, is published a dispatch, from Boston, dated Oct. 
31.(14) It is said that, near Bridgewater, at four o'clock in the morning of 
Oct. 31, two men had seen a spectacle in the sky. The men were not 
astronomers. They were undertakers. There may be a disposition to think that 
these observers were not in their own field of greatest expertness, and to 
think that we are not very exacting as to the sources of our data. But we 
have to depend upon undertakers, for instance: early in our investigations, 
we learned that the prestige of astronomers has been built upon their high 
moral character, all of them most excellently going to bed soon after 
sunset, so as to get up early and write all day upon astronomical subjects. 
But the exemplary in one respect may not lead to much advancement in some 
other respect. Our undertakers saw, in the sky, something like a 
searchlight. It played down upon this earth, as if directed by an 
investigator, and the it flashed upward. "All of the balloons in which 
ascensions are made in this State were accounted for today and a search 
through southeastern Massachusetts failed to reveal any further traces of 
the supposed airship." it is said that "mysterious bright lights," believed 
to have come from a balloon, had been reported from many places in New 
England. The week before, persons at Ware had said that they had seen an 
illuminated balloon passing over the town, early [216/217] in the morning. 
During the summer such reports had come from Bristol, Conn., and later from 
Pittsfield, Mass., and from White River Junction, Vt. "In all these cases, 
however, no balloon could be found, all the known airships being accounted 
for at the time." In the New York Sun, Dec. 13, 1909, it is said that, 
during the autumn of 1908, reports had come from different places in 
Connecticut, upon a mysterious light that moved rapidly in the sky.(15) 

Venus moved on, travelling around the sun, which was revolving around this 
earth, or travelling any way to suit anybody. In December, 1909, the planet 
was again approaching this earth. So close was Venus to this earth, upon the 
15th of December, 1909, crowds stood, at noon, in the streets of Rome, 
watching it, or her, (New York Sun, Dec. 16).(16) At 3 o'clock, afternoon of 
December 24th crowds stood in the streets of New York, watching Venus (New 
York Tribune, Dec. 25).(17) One supposes that upon these occasions Venus may 
have been within several thousand miles of this earth. At any rate I have 
never heard of one fairly good reason for supposing otherwise. If again 
something appeared in local skies of this earth, or in the skies of New 
England, and sometimes during the few hours of the visibility of Venus, the 
object was or was not Venus, all according to the details of various 
descriptions, and the credibility of the details. The searchlight, for 
instance; more than one light; directions and motions. Venus, at the time, 
was several hours after sunset, slowly descending in the southwest: primary 
maximum brilliance Jan. 8th, 1910; inferior conjunction Feb. 12th. 

There is an amusing befuddlement to clear away first. Upon the night of 
September 8, 1909, a luminous object had been seen sailing over New England, 
and sounds from it, like sounds from a motor, had been heard. Then Mr. 
Wallace Tillinghast, of Worcester, Mass., announced that this light had been 
a lamp in his "secret aëroplane," and that upon this night he had travelled, 
in said "secret aëroplane," from Boston to New York, and back to Boston. At 
this time the longest recorded flight, in an aëroplane, was Farman's, of 111 
miles, from Rheims, August, 1909; and, in the United States, according to 
records, it was not until May 29, 1910, that Curtiss flew from Albany to New 
York City, making one stop in the 150 miles, however.(18) So this unrecorded 
[217/218] flight made some stir in the newspapers. Mr. Tillinghast meant his 
story humorously of course. I mention it because, if anybody should look the 
matter up, he will find the yarn involved in the newspaper accounts. If 
nothing else had been seen, Mr. Tillinghast might still tell his story, and 
explain why he never did anything with his astonishing "secret aëroplane;" 
but something else was seen, and upon one of the nights in which it 
appeared, Tillinghast was known to be in his home. 

According to the New York Tribune, Dec. 21, 1909, Immigration Inspector Hoe, 
of Boston, had reported having seen, at one o'clock in the morning of 
December 20, "a bright light passing over the harbor" and had concluded that 
he had seen an airship of some kind.(19) 

New York Tribune, Dec. 23 -- that a "mysterious airship" had appeared over 
the town of Worcester, Mass., "sweeping the heavens with a searchlight of 
tremendous power."(20) It had come from the southeast, and travelled 
northwest, then hovering over the city, disappearing in the direction of 
Marlboro. Two hours later, it returned. "Thousands thronged the streets, 
watching the mysterious visitor." Again it hovered, then moving away, 
heading first to the south and then to the east. 

The next night, something was seen, at 6 o'clock, at Boston. "The 
searchlights shot across the sky line." "As it flew away to the north, 
queries began to pour into the newspaper offices and the police stations, 
regarding the remarkable visitation." It is said that an hour and a half 
later, an object that was supposed to be an airship with a powerful 
searchlight, appeared in the sky, at Willimantic, Conn., "hovering" over the 
town about 15 minutes. In the New York Sun, Dec. 24, are more details.(21) 
It is said that, at Willimantic, had been seen a large searchlight, 
approaching from the east, and that then dark outlines of something behind 
the searchlight had been seen. Also, in the Sun, it is said that whatever it 
may have been that was seen at Boston, it was a dark object, with several 
red lights and a searchlight, approaching Boston from the west, hovering for 
10 minutes, and then moving away westward. From Lynn, Mass., it was 
described as "a long black object," moving in the direction of Salem, and 
then returning, [218/219] "at a high speed." It is said that the object had 
been seen at Marlboro, Mass., nine times since Dec. 14. 

New York Tribune, Jan. 1, 1910 -- dispatch from Huntington, West Virginia, 
Dec. 31, 1909 -- "Three huge lights of almost uniform dimensions appeared in 
the early morning sky, in this neighborhood, today. Joseph Green, a farmer, 
declared that they were meteors, which fell on his farm. An extensive search 
of his land by others who saw the lights was fruitless, and many persons 
believe that an airship had sped over the country."(22) 

In the Tribune, Jan. 13, 1910, it is said that, at 9 o'clock, morning of 
Jan. 12, an airship had been seen at Chattanooga, Tenn.(23) "Thousands saw 
the craft, and heard the `chug' of its engine." Later the object was 
reported from Huntsville, Alabama. New York Tribune, Jan. 15 -- dispatch 
from Chattanooga, Jan. 14 -- "For the third successive day, a mysterious 
white aircraft passed over Chattanooga, about noon today. It came from the 
north, and was travelling southeast, disappearing over Missionary Ridge. On 
Wednesday, it came south, and then on Thursday, it returned north."(24) 

In the middle of December, 1909, someone had won a prize for sailing a 
dirigible from St. Cyr to the Eiffel Tower and back. 

St. Cyr is several miles from Paris. 

Huntsville, Alabama, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, are 75 miles apart.(25) 

An association between the planet Venus and "mysterious visitors" either 
illumines or haunts our data. In the New York Tribune, Jan. 29, 1910, it is 
said that a luminous object, thought to be Winnecke's comet, had been seen, 
Jan. 28, near Venus; reported from the Manila Observatory.(26) 

I have another datum that perhaps belongs to this series of events. Every 
night, from the 14th to the 23rd of December, 1909, if we accept the account 
from Marlboro, a luminous object was seen travelling, or exploring, in the 
sky of New England. Certainly enough it was no "secret airship" of this 
earth, unless its navigator went to extremes with the notion that the best 
way to keep a secret is to announce it with red lights and a searchlight. 
However, our acceptance depends upon general data as to the de- [219/220] 
velopment or terrestrial aeronautics. But upon the night of December 24th, 
the object was not seen in New England, and it may have been travelling or 
exploring somewhere else. Night of the 24th--Venus in the southwest in the 
early hours of the evening. In the English Mechanic, 104-71, a 
correspondent, who signs himself "Rigel," writes that, upon Dec. 24, at 8.30 
o'clock in the evening, he saw a luminous object appear above the 
northeastern horizon and slowly move southward, until 8.50 o'clock, then 
turning around, retracing, and disappearing whence it came, at two minutes 
past nine.(27) The correspondent is James Ferguson, Rossbrien, Limerick, 
Ireland. He writes frequently upon astronomical and meteorological subjects, 
and is still contributing to the somewhat enlightened columns of the English 
Mechanic.(28) 


* * *



Nov. 19, 1912 -- explosive sounds reported from Sunninghill, Berkshire. No 
earthquake was recorded at the Kew Observatory, and, in the opinion of W.F. 
Denning (Nature, 9-363, 417), the explosion was in the sky.(29) It was a 
terrific explosion, according to the Westminster Gazette (Nov. 19).(30) 
There was either one great explosion that rumbled and echoed for five 
minutes, or there were repeated detonations, resembling cannonading -- "like 
a tremendous discharge of big guns" according to reports from Abingdon, 
Lewes, and Epsom. Sunninghill is about ten miles from Reading, and Abingdon 
is near Reading, but the sound was heard in London, and down by the English 
Channel, and even in the island of Alderney. In the Gazette, Nov. 28, Sir 
George Fordham (H.G. Fordham) writes that, in his opinion, it was an 
explosion in the sky.(31) He says -- "The phenomena of airshock never have, 
I believe, been fully investigated." His admissions and his omissions remain 
the same as they have since the occurrences of the year 1889. He does not 
mention that, according to Philip T. Kenway, of Hambledon, near Godalming, 
about thirty miles southeast of Reading, the sounds were heard again the 
next day, from 1.45 P.M. to 2 P.M. Mr. Kenway thinks that there had been 
big-gun firing at Portsmouth (West. Gaz., Nov. 21).(32) In the London 
Standard, a correspondent, writing from Dorking, says that the phenomena of 
the 19th were like concussions from [220/221] cannonading -- "at regular 
intervals" -- "at quick intervals, lasting some seconds each time, for five 
minutes, by the clock."(33) 

It develops that Reading was the center over which the detonations occurred. 
In the Westminster Gazette, Nov. 30, it is said that the shocks had been 
felt in Reading, upon the 19th, 20th, and 21st.(34) Only from Reading have I 
record of phenomena upon the 21st. Mr. H.L. Hawkins, Lecturer in Geology, of 
the Reading University, writes that according to his investigations there 
had been no gun-firing in England, to which the detonations could be 
attributed. He says that Fordham's explanation was in accord with his own 
investigations, or that detonations had occurred in the sky. He writes that, 
inasmuch as the detonations had occurred upon three successive days, a 
shower of meteors, of long duration, would have to be supposed. How he ever 
visualized that unerring shower, striking one point over this earth's 
surface, and nowhere else, day after day, if this earth be a rotating and 
revolving body, I can not see. If he should say that by coincidence this 
repetition could occur, then by what coincidence of coincidences could the 
same repetitions have occurred in this same local sky, centering around 
Reading, seven years before? The indications are that this earth is 
stationary, no matter how unreasonable that may sound. 

In the Westminster Gazette, Dec. 9, W.F. Denning writes that without doubt 
the phenomena were "meteoric explosions."(35) But he alludes to the 
"airquake and strange noises" that were heard upon the 19th. He does not 
mention the detonations that were heard upon the following days. Not one of 
these writers mentions the sounds that were heard in Reading, in November, 
1905. 

London Standard, Nov. 23, 1912 -- that, according to Lieut. Col. Trewman, of 
Reading, the sounds had been heard at Reading, at 9 A.M., upon the 19th; 
1.45 P.M., the 20th; 3.30 P.M., the 21st.(36) [221]

CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE





"UNKNOWN Aircraft Over Dover." 

According to the Dover correspondent to the London Times (Jan. 6, 1913) 
something had been seen, over Dover, heading from the sea.(1) 

In the London Standard, Jan. 24, 1913, it is said that, upon the morning of 
Jan. 4, an unknown airship had been seen, over Dover, and that, about the 
same time, the lights of an airship had been seen over the Bristol 
Channel.(2) These places are several hundred miles apart. 

London Times, Jan. 21 -- report by Capt. Lindsay, Chief Constable of 
Glamorganshire: that, about five o'clock, in the afternoon of Jan. 17, he 
saw an object in the sky of Cardiff, Wales.(3) He says that he called the 
attention of a bystander, who agreed with him that it was a large object. 
"It was much larger than the Willows airship, and left in its trail a dense 
smoke. It disappeared quickly." 

The next day, according to the Times, there were other reports: people in 
Cardiff, saw something that was lighted or that carried lights, moving 
rapidly in the sky.(4) In the Times, of the 28th, it is said that an airship 
that carried a brilliant light had been seen in Liverpool.(5) "It is stated 
at the Liverpool Aviation School that none of the airmen had been out on 
Saturday night." Dispatches from town after town -- a travelling thing in 
the sky, carrying a light, and also a searchlight that swept the ground. It 
is said that a vessel, of which the outlines had been clearly seen, had 
appeared in the sky of Cardiff, Newport, Neath, and other places in Wales. 
In the Standard, Jan. 31, is published a list of cities where the object had 
been seen. Here a writer tries to conclude that some foreign airship had 
made half a dozen visits to England and Wales, or had come once, remaining 
three weeks; but he gives up the attempt, thinking that nothing could have 
[222/223] reached England and have sailed away half a dozen times without 
being seen to cross the coast; thinking that the idea of anything having 
made one journey, and remaining three weeks in the air deserved no 
consideration.(6) 

If the unknown object did carry something like a searchlight, an idea of its 
power is given in an account in the Cardiff Evening Express, Jan. 25, 1913 -
- "Last evening brilliant lights were seen, sweeping skyward, and now, this 
evening, the lights grow bolder.(7) Streets and houses in the locality of 
Totterdown were suddenly illuminated by a brilliant, piercing light, which, 
sweeping upward, gave many spectators a fine view of the hills beyond." In 
the Express, Feb. 6, is a report upon this light like a searchlight, and the 
object that flashed it, by the police of Dulais Valley.(8) Also there is an 
account by a police sergeant, of a luminous thing that was for a while 
stationary in the sky, and then moved away.(9) 

Still does the conventional explanation, or suggestion, survive. It is said 
that members of the staff of the Evening Express had gone to the roof of the 
newspaper building, but had seen only the planet Venus, which was brilliant 
at this time. 

Then writes a correspondent, to the Express, that the object could not have 
been Venus, because he had seen it travelling at a rate of 20 or 30 miles an 
hour, and had heard sounds from it.(10) Someone else writes that not 
possibly could the thing be Venus: he had seen it as "a bright red light, 
going very fast." Still someone else says that he had seen the seeming 
vessel upon the 5th of February, and that it had suddenly disappeared.(11) 

There is a hiatus. Between the 5th and the 21st of February, nothing like an 
airship was seen in the sky of England and Wales. If we can find that 
somewhere else something similar was seen in the sky, in this period, one 
supposes that it was the same object, exploring or manoeuvring somewhere 
else. It seems however that there were several of these objects, because of 
simultaneous observations at places far apart. If we can find that, during 
the absence from England and Wales, similar objects were seen somewhere 
else, a great deal of what we try to think upon the subject will depend upon 
how far from Great Britain they were seen. It seems incredible that the 
planet Venus should deceive [223/224] thousands of Britons, up to the 5th of 
February, and stop her deceptions abruptly upon that date, and then abruptly 
resume deceptions upon the 21st, in places at a distance apart. These 
circumstances oppose the idea of collective hallucinations, by which some 
writers in the newspapers tried to explain. If they were hallucinations, the 
hallucinations renewed collectively, upon the 21st, in towns one hundred 
miles apart. One extraordinary association is that all appearances, except 
the first, were in hours of visibility of Venus, then an "evening star." 

Upon the night of the 21st, a luminous object was reported from towns in 
Yorkshire and from towns in Warwickshire, two regions about one hundred 
miles apart; about 10 P.M. All former attempts to explain had been 
abandoned, and the general supposition was that German airships were 
manoeuvring over England. But not a thing had been seen to cross the coast 
of England, though guards were patrolling the coasts, especially 
commissioned to watch for foreign airships. Sailors in the North Sea, and 
people in Holland and Belgium had seen nothing that could be thought a 
German airship sailing to or from England. A writer in Flight takes up as 
especially mysterious the appearance far inland, in Warwickshire. Then came 
reports from Portsmouth, Ipswich, Hornsea, and Hull, but, one notes, no 
more, at this time, from Wales. Also in Ipswich, which is more than a 
hundred miles from the Yorkshire towns, a luminous object was seen upon the 
night of the 21st. Ipswich Evening Star, Feb. 25 -- something that carried a 
searchlight that had been seen upon the nights of the 21st and 24th, moving 
in various directions, and then "dashing off at lightning speed" -- that, at 
Hunstanton, had been seen three bright lights travelling from the eastern 
sky, remaining in sight 30 minutes, stationary, or hovering over the town, 
and then disappearing in the northwest.(12) Portsmouth Evening News, Feb. 25 
-- that soon after 8 P.M., evening of the 24th, had been seen a very bright 
light, appearing and disappearing, remaining over Portsmouth about one hour, 
and then moving away.(13) Portsmouth and Ipswich are about 120 miles apart. 
In the London newspapers, it is said that, upon the evening of the 25th, 
crowds stood in the streets of Hull, watching something in the [224/225] 
sky, "the lights of which were easily distinguishable." Hull is about 190 
miles northeast of Portsmouth.(14) Hull Daily Mail, Feb. 26 -- that a crowd 
had watched a light high in the air. It is said that the light had been 
stationary for almost half an hour and had then shot away northward.(15) In 
the Times, Feb. 28, are published reports upon "the clear outlines of an 
airship, which was carrying a dazzling searchlight," from Portland, 
Burcleaves, St. Alban's Head, Papplewich, and the Orkneys.(16) The last 
account, after a long interval, that I know of, is another report from Capt. 
Lindsay: that, about 9 o'clock, evening of April 8th, he and many persons 
had seen, over Cardiff, something that carried a brilliant light and 
travelled at a rate of sixty or seventy miles an hour. 

Upon April 24, 1913, the planet Venus was at inferior conjunction.(17) 

In the Times, Feb. 28, it is said that a fire-balloon had been found in 
Yorkshire, and it is suggested that someone had been sending up fire-
balloons.(18) 

In the Bull. Soc. Astro. de France, 1913-178, it is said that the people of 
England were as credulous as the people of Cherbourg, and had permitted 
themselves to be deceived by the planet Venus.(19) 

If German airships were manoeuvring over England, without being seen either 
approaching or departing, appearing sometimes far inland in England without 
being seen to cross the well-guarded coasts, it was secret manoeuvring, 
inasmuch as the accusation was denied in Germany (Times, Feb. 26 and 
27).(20) It was then one of the most brilliantly proclaimed of secrets, or 
it was concealment under one of the most powerful searchlights ever seen. 
Possibly an airship from Germany could appear over such a city as Hull, upon 
the east coast of England, without being seen to arrive or to depart, but so 
far from Germany is Portsmouth, for instance, that one does feel that 
something else will have to be thought of. The appearances over Liverpool 
and over towns in Wales might be attributed to German airships by someone 
who had not seen a map since he left school. There were more observations 
upon sudden appearances and disappearances than I have recorded: 
stationariness often occurred. [225/226] 

The objects were absent from the sky of Great Britain, from Feb. 5 to Feb. 
21. 

According to data published by Prof. Chant, in the Journal of the Royal 
Astronomical Society of Canada, 7-148, the most extraordinary procession in 
our records was seen, in the sky of Canada, upon the night of Feb. 9, 
1913.(21) Either groups of meteors, in one straight line, passed over the 
city of Toronto, or there was a procession of unknown objects, carrying 
lights. According to Prof. Chant, the spectacle was seen from the 
Saskatchewan to Bermuda, but if this long route was traversed, data do not 
so indicate. The supposed route was diagonally across New York State, from 
Buffalo, to a point near New York City, but from New York State are recorded 
no observations other than might have been upon ordinary meteors, this 
night. A succession of luminous objects passed over Toronto, night of Feb. 
9, 1913, occupying from three to five minutes in passing, according to 
different estimates. If one will think that they were meteors, at least one 
will have to think that no such meteors had ever been seen before. In the 
Journal, 7-405, W.F. Denning writes that, though he had been watching the 
heavens since the year 1865, he had never seen anything like this.(22) In 
most of the observations, the procession is described as a whole -- "like an 
express train, lighted at night" -- "the lights were at different points, 
one in front, and a rear light, then a succession of lights in the tail." 
Almost all of the observations relate to the sky of Toronto and not far from 
Toronto. It is questionable that the same spectacle was seen in Bermuda, 
this night. The supposed long flight from the Saskatchewan to Bermuda might 
indicate something of a meteoric nature, but the meteor-explanation must 
take into consideration that these objects were so close to this earth that 
sounds from them were heard, and that, without succumbing to gravitation, 
they followed the curvature of this earth at a relatively low velocity that 
can not compare with the velocity of ordinary meteors. 

If now accepted that again, the next day, objects were seen in the sky of 
Toronto, but objects unlighted, in the daytime -- I suppose that to some 
minds will come the thought that this is extraordinary, and that almost 
immediately the whole subject will then be forgotten. Prof. Chant says that, 
according to the [226/227] Toronto Daily Star, unknown objects, but dark 
objects this time, were seen at Toronto, in the afternoon of the next day -- 
"not seen clearly enough to determine their nature, but they did not seem to 
be clouds or birds or smoke, and it was suggested that they were airships 
cruising over the city."(23) Toronto Daily Star, February 10 -- "They passed 
from west to east, in three groups, and then returned west in more scattered 
formation, about seven or eight in all."(24) [227]

CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR





AUGUST 1914 -- this arena-like earth, with its horizon banking high into a 
Coliseum, when seen from not too far above -- faint, rattling sounds of the 
opening of boundaries -- tawny formations slinking into the arena -- their 
crouchings and seizures and crunchings. Aug. 13, 1914 -- things that were 
gathering in the skies. They were seen by G.W. Atkins, of Elstree, Herts, 
and were seen again upon the 16th and the 17th (Observatory, 37-358).(1) 
Sept. 9, 1914 -- a host in the sky; watched several hours by W.H. Steavenson 
(Jour. B.A.A., 25-27).(2) There were round appearances, but some of them 
were shaped like dumb bells. They were not seeds, snowflakes, insects, nor 
anything else that they "should" have been, according to Mr. Steavenson. He 
says that they were large bodies. 

Oct. 10, 1914 -- a ship that was seen in the sky -- or "an absolutely black, 
spindle-shaped object" crossing the sun. It was seen, at Manchester, by 
Albert Buss (Eng. Mec., 100-236).(3) "Its extraordinarily clear-cut outline 
was surrounded by a kind of halo, giving the impression of a ship, plowing 
her way through the sea, throwing up white-foamed waves with her prow." 

Mikkelsen (Lost in the Arctic, p. 345):(4) 

"During the last few days (Oct., 1914) we have been much tumbled up and down 
in our minds, owing to a remarkable occurrence, somewhat in the nature of 
Robinson Crusoe's encounter with the footprints in the sand. Our advanced 
load has been attacked -- an empty petroleum cask is found riddled with tiny 
holes, such as would be made by a charge of shot! Now a charge of shot is 
scarcely likely to materialize out of nowhere; one is accustomed to 
associate the phenomenon with the presence of human beings. It is none of 
our doing -- then whose doing is it? We hit upon the wildest theories to 
account for it, as we sit in the tent turning the mysterious object over and 
over. No [228/229] beast of our acquaintance could make all those little 
round holes: what animal could even open its jaws so wide? And why should 
anybody take the trouble to make a target of our gear? Are there Eskimos 
about -- Eskimos with guns? There are no footprints to be seen: it could 
scarcely have been an animal -- the whole thing is highly mysterious." 

Jan. 31, 1915 -- a symbolic-looking formation upon the moon -- six or seven 
lights, in Littrow, arranged like the Greek letter Gamma (Eng. Mec., 101-
47).(5) 

Feb. 13, 1915 -- Steep Island, Chusan Archipelago -- a lighthouse-keeper 
complained to Capt. W.F. Tyler, R.N., that a British warship had fired a 
projectile at the lighthouse. But no vessel had fired a shot, and it is said 
that the object must have been a meteor (Nature, 97-17).(6) 

In the middle of February, 1915, the planet Venus was about two months and a 
half past inferior conjunction.(7) If objects like navigating constructions 
were seen in the sky, at this time, there may be an association, but I am 
turning against that association, feeling that it is harmful to our wider 
expression that extra-mundane vessels have been seen in the sky of this 
earth, and that they come from regions at present unknown. New York Tribune, 
Feb. 15, 1915 -- that, at 10 P.M., Feb. 14, three aëroplanes had been seen 
to cross the St. Lawrence river, near Morristown, N.Y., according to 
reports, but that, in the opinion of the Dominion Police, nothing but fire-
balloons had been seen.(8) It is said that two "responsible residents" had 
seen two of the objects cross the river, between 8 and 8.30 P.M., and then 
return five hours later. In the Canadian Parliament, Sir Wilfred Laurier had 
said that, at 9 P.M., he had been called by the Mayor of Brockwell, telling 
him that three aëroplanes with "powerful searchlights" had crossed the St. 
Lawrence.(9) The story is told in the New York Herald.(10) Here it is said 
that, according to the Chief of Police, of Ogdensburg, N.Y., a farmer, 
living five miles from Ogdensburg, had reported having seen an aëroplane, 
upon the 12th. Then it is said that the mystery had been solved: that, while 
celebrating the one hundredth anniversary of peace between the United States 
and Canada, some young men in Morristown had sent up paper balloons, which 
had ex- [229/230] ploded in the sky, after 9 P.M., night of the 14th. New 
York Times -- that the objects had been seen first at Guananoque, 
Ontario.(11) Here it is said that the balloon-story is absurd. According to 
the Dominion Observatory, the wind was, at the time, blowing from the east, 
and the objects had travelled toward the northeast. It is said that one of 
the objects had, for several minutes, turned a powerful searchlight upon the 
town of Brockwell.(12) 

Upon December 11, 1915, Bernard Thomas, of Glenorchy, Tasmania, saw a 
"particularly bright spot upon the moon" (Eng. Mec., 103-10).(13) It was on 
the north shore of Mare Crisium, and "looked almost like a star." In Dr. 
Thomas' opinion, it was sunlight reflected from the rim of a small crater. 
The crater Picard is near the north shore of Mare Crisium, and most of the 
illuminations near Picard have occurred several months from an opposition of 
Mars. 

In December, 1915, another new formation upon the moon -- reported from the 
Observatory of Paris -- something like a black wall from the center to the 
ramparts of Aristillus (Bull. Soc. Astro. de France, 30-383).(14) 

Jan. 12, 1916 -- a shock in Cincinnati, Ohio. Buildings were shaken. The 
quake was from an explosion in the sky. Flashes were seen in the sky. (New 
York Herald, Jan. 13, 1916).(15) 

Feb. 9, 1916 -- opposition of Mars.(16) 

In the English Mechanic, 104-71, James Ferguson writes that someone had 
seen, at 11 o'clock, night of July 31, 1916, at Ballinasloe, Ireland, just 
such a moving thing, or just such a sailing, exploring thing as is now 
familiar in our records.(17) For fifteen minutes it moved in a northwesterly 
direction. For three quarters of an hour it was stationary. Then it moved 
back to the point where first it had been seen, remaining visible until four 
o'clock in the morning. Whatever this object may have been, it left the sky 
at about the time that Venus appeared, as a "morning star," in the sky of 
Ballinasloe, and resembles the occurrence of Sept. 11, 1852, reported by 
Lord Wrottesley. Inferior conjunction of Venus was upon July 3, 1916.(18) We 
have noticed that all occurrences that we somewhat reluctantly associate 
with nearness of Venus associate more with times of greatest bril- [230/231] 
liance, five weeks before and after inferior conjunction, than with dates of 
conjunction. Somebody may demonstrate that at these times Venus comes 
closest to this earth. 

Oct. 10, 1916 -- a reddish shadow that spread over part of the lunar crater 
Plato; reported from the Observatory of Florence, Italy (Sci. Amer., 121-
181).(19) 

Nov. 25, 1916 -- about twenty-five bright flashes, in rapid succession, in 
the sky of Cardiff, Wales, according to Arthur Mee (Eng. Mec., 104-239).(20) 

Col. Markwick writes, in the Jour. B.A.A., 27-188, that, at 6:10 P.M., April 
5, 1917, he had seen, upon the sun, a solitary spot, different from all 
sunspots that he had seen in the experience of forty-three years.(21) Col. 
Markwick had written to Mr. Maunder, of the Greenwich Observatory, and had 
been told that, in photographs taken of the sun upon this day, one at 11.17 
and another at 11.20 o'clock, there was no sign of a sunspot. 

July 4, 1917 -- an eclipse of the sun, and an extraordinary luminous object 
said to have been a meteor, in France (Bull. Soc. Astro. de France, 31-
299).(22) About 6.20 P.M., this day, there was an explosion over the town of 
Colby, Wisconsin, and a stone fell from the sky (Science, Sept. 14, 
1917).(23) 

Aug. 29, 1917 -- a luminous object that was seen moving upon the moon (Bull. 
Soc. Astro. de France, 31-439).(24) 

Feb. 21, 1919 -- an intensely black line extending out from the lunar crater 
Lexall (Eng. Mec., 109-517).(25) 

Upon May 19, 1919, while Harry Hawker was at sea, untraceable messages 
meaningless in the languages of this earth, were picked up by wireless, 
according to dispatches to the newspapers. They were interpreted as the 
letters K U J and V K A J. 

In October 1913, occurred something that may not be so very mysterious 
because of nearness to the sea. One supposes that if extra-mundane vessels 
have sometimes come close to this earth, then sailing away, terrestrial 
aëronauts may have occasionally left this earth, or may have been seized and 
carried away from this earth. Upon the morning of Oct. 13, 1913, Albert 
Jewel started to fly his aëroplane from Hempstead Plains, Long Island, to 
Staten Island. The route that he expected to take was over Jamaica Bay, 
Brooklyn, Coney Island, and the Narrows. [231/232] New York Times, Oct. 14, 
1913 -- "That was the last seen or heard of him...he has been as completely 
lost as if he evaporated into air."(26) But as to the disappearance of Capt. 
James there are circumstances that do call for especial attention. New York 
Times, June 2, 1919 -- that Capt. Mansell R. James was lost somewhere in the 
Berkshire Hills, upon his flight from Boston to Atlantic City, or, rather, 
upon the part of his route between Lee, Mass., and Mitchel Field, Long 
Island.(27) He had left Lee upon May 29th. Over the Berkshires, or in the 
Berkshires, he had disappeared. According to later dispatches, searching 
parties had "scoured" the Berkshires, without finding a trace of him. Upon 
June 4th, army planes arrived and searched systematically. There was general 
excitement, in this mystery of Capt. James. Rewards were offered; all 
subscribers of the Southern New England Telephone Company were enlisted in a 
quest for news of any kind; boys scouts turned out. Up to this date of 
writing there had been nothing but a confusion of newspaper dispatches: that 
two children had seen a plane, about thirteen miles north of Long Island 
Sound; that two men had seen a plane fall into the Hudson River, near 
Poughkeepsie; that, in a gully of Mount Riga, near Millerstown, N.Y., had 
been found the remains of a plane; that part of a plane had been washed 
ashore from Long Island Sound, near Branford.(28) The latest interest in the 
subject that I know of was in the summer of 1921. A heavy object was known 
to be at the bottom of the Hudson River, near Poughkeepsie, and was thought 
to be Capt. James' plane. It was dredged up and found to be a log. 

For an extraordinary story of windows, in Newark, N. J., that were 
perforated by unfindable bullets, see New York Evening Telegram, Sept. 19, 
1919, and the Newark Evening News.(29) The occurrence is a counterpart of 
Mikkelsen's experience. 

The detonations at Reading were heard seven years apart. Here it is not 
quite seven years later. London Times, Sept. 26, 1919 -- that upon Sept. 25, 
a shock had been felt at Reading; that inquiries had led to information of 
no known explosion near Reading.(30) In the Times, Oct. 14, Mr. H.L. Hawkins 
writes that the shock was "quite definitely an earthquake, but its origin 
was superficial" and that the shock "was transmitted through the [232/233] 
earth more than through the air."(31) In the London Daily Chronicle, Sept. 
27, Mr. Hawkins, having considered all suggestions that shock was a 
subterranean earthquake, had written: "However, as the whole thing 
terminated in a bump and a big bang, without subsequent shaking of the 
ground, it points more to an explosion of a natural type up in the air than 
to a real earthquake."(32) And, in the London Daily Mail, Mr. Hawkins is 
quoted: that if the detonation were local, he would believe that it was an 
aërial explosion ("meteoric"); but, if it were widespread, it would be 
considered an earthquake.(33) And in the whole series of the Reading 
phenomena, this violent detonation was most distinctly local to Reading.(34) 

Reading Observer, Sept. 27, 1919 -- "The most probable explanation of the 
occurrence is that there was an explosion somewhere near enough to affect 
the town... Officials at the Greenwich Observatory were unable to throw any 
light on the matter, and said that their instruments showed no signs of 
earth-disturbance."(35) 

It is said that the sound and shock were violent, and that, in the 
residential parts of Reading, the streets were crowded with persons 
discussing the occurrence. 

There was a similar shock in Michigan, Nov. 27, 1919. In many cities, 
persons rushed from their homes, thinking that there had been an earthquake 
(New York Times, Nov. 28).(36) But, in Indiana, Illinois, and Michigan, a 
"blinding glare" was seen in the sky. Our acceptance is that this occurrence 
is, upon a small scale, of the type of many catastrophes in Italy and South 
America, for instance, when just such "blinding glares" have been seen in 
the sky, data of which have been suppressed by conventional scientists, or 
data of which have not impressed conventional scientists. 

English Mechanic, 110-257 -- J.W. Scholes, of Huddersfield, writes that, 
upon Dec. 19, 1919, he saw, near the lunar crater Littrow, "a very 
conspicuous black-ink mark."(37) Upon page 282, W.J. West, of Gosport, 
writes that he had seen the mark upon the 7th of December.(38) 

March 22, 1920 -- a light in the sky of this earth, and an illumination upon 
the moon (Eng. Mec., 111-142).(39) That so close [233/234] to this earth is 
the moon that illuminations known as "auroral" often affect both this earth 
and the moon. 

July 20 and 21, and Sept. 13, 1920 -- dull rumbling sounds and quakes at 
Comrie, Perthshire (London Times, July 23 and Sept. 14, 1920).(40) 

According to a dispatch to the Los Angeles Times -- clipping sent to me by 
Mr. L.A. Hopkins, of Chicago -- thunder and lightning and heavy rain, at 
Portland, Oregon, July 21, 1920: objects falling from the sky; glistening, 
white fragments that looked like "bits of polished china."(41) "The 
explanation of the local Weather Bureau is that they may have been picked up 
by whirlwinds and carried to the district where they were found." The 
objection to this standardized explanation is the homogeneousness of the 
falling objects. How can one conceive of winds raging over some region 
covered with the usual great diversity of loose objects and substances, 
having a liking for little white stones, sorting over maybe a million black 
ones, green ones, white ones, and red ones, to make the desired selection? 
One supposes that a storm brought to this earth fragments of a manufactured 
object, made of something like china, from some other world. 

In the Literary Digest, Sept. 2, 1921, is published a letter from Carl G. 
Gowman, of Detroit, Michigan, upon the fall from the sky, in southwest 
China, Nov. 17 (1920?) of a substance that resembled blood.(42) It fell upon 
three villages close together, and was said to have fallen somewhere else 
forty miles away.(43) The quantity was great: in one of the villages, the 
substance "covered the ground completely." Mr. Gowman accepts that this 
substance did fall from the sky, because it was found upon roofs as well as 
upon the ground. He rejects the conventional red-dust explanation, because 
the spots did not dissolve in several subsequent rains. He says that 
anything like pollen is out of the question, because at the time nothing was 
in bloom. 

Nov. 23, 1920 -- a correspondent writes, to the English Mechanic, 112-214, 
that he saw a shaft of light projecting from the moon, or a spot so bright 
that it appeared to project, from the limb of the moon, in the region of 
Funerius.(44) 

About Jan. 1, 1921 -- several irregular, black objects that crossed 
[234/235] the sun. To the Rev. William Ellison (Eng. Mec., 112-276) they 
looked like pieces of burnt paper.(45) 

July 25, 1921 -- a loud report, followed by a sharp tremor, and a rumbling 
sound, at Comrie (London Times, July 27, 1921).(46) 

July 31, 1921 -- a common indication of other lands from which come objects 
and substances to this earth -- but our reluctance to bother with anything 
so ordinarily marvellous -- 

Because we have conceived of intenser times and furies of differences of 
potential between this earth and other worlds: torrents of dinosaurs, in 
broad volumes that were streaked with lesser animals, pouring from the sky, 
with a foam of tusks and fangs, enveloped in a bloody vapor that was falsely 
dramatized by the sun, with rainbow-mockery. Or, in terms of planetary 
emotions, such an outpouring was the serenade of some other world to this 
earth. If poetry is imagery, and, if a flow of images be solid poetry, such 
a recitation was in three-dimensional hyperbole that was probably seen, or 
overheard, and criticized in Mars, and condemned for its extravagance in 
Jupiter. Some other world, meeting this earth, ransacking his solid 
imagination and uttering her living metaphors: singing a flood of mastodons, 
purring her butterflies, bellowing an ardor of buffaloes. Sailing away--
sneaking up close to the planet Venus, murmuring her antelopes, or arching 
his periphery and spitting horses at her -- 

Poor, degenerate times -- nowadays something comes close to this earth and 
lisps little commonplaces to her -- 

July 31, 1921 -- a shower of little frogs that fell upon Anton Wagner's 
farm, near Sterling, Conn. New York Evening World, Aug. 1, 1921).(47) 

At sunset, Aug. 7, 1921, an unknown luminous object was seen, near the sun, 
at Mt. Hamilton, by an astronomer, Prof. Campbell, and by one of those who 
may some day go out and set foot upon regions that are supposed not to be: 
by an aviator, Capt. Rickenbacker.(48) In the English Mechanic, 114-211, 
another character in these fluttering vistas of the opening of the coming 
drama of Extra-geography, Col. Markwick, a conventional astronomer and also 
a recorder of strange things, lists other observations upon this object, the 
earliest upon the 6th, by Dr. Emmert, [235/236] of Detroit.(49) In the 
English Mechanic, 114-241, H.P. Hollis, once upon a time deliciously "exact" 
and positive, says something, in commenting upon these observations, that 
looks like a little weakness in Exclusionism, because the old sureness is 
turning slightly shaky -- "that there are more wonderful things in the sky 
than we suspect, or that it is easy to be self-deceived."(50) 

If is funny to read of an "earthquake," described in technical lingo, and to 
have a datum that indicates that it was no earthquake at all, in the usual 
seismologic sense, but a concussion from an explosion in the sky. Aug. 7, 
1921 -- a severe shock at New Canton, Virginia. See Bull. Seis. Soc. Amer., 
11- 197 -- Prof. Stephen Taber's explanation that the shock probably 
originated in the slate belt of Buckingham County, intensity about V on the 
R.-F. scale.(51) But then it is said that, according to the "authorities" of 
the McCormick Observatory, the concussion was from an explosion in the sky. 
The time is coming when nothing funny will be seen in this subject, if some 
day be accepted at least parts of the masses of data that I am now holding 
back, until I can more fully develop them -- that some of the greatest 
catastrophes that have devastated the face of this earth have been 
concussions from explosions in the sky, so repeating in a local sky weeks at 
a time, months sometimes, or intermittently for centuries, that fixed 
origins above the ravaged areas are indicated. 

New York Tribune, Sept. 2, 1921:(52) 

"J.C.H. Macbeth, London Manager of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company, 
Ltd., told several hundred men, at a luncheon of the Rotary Club, of New 
York, yesterday, that Signor Marconi believed he had intercepted messages 
from Mars, during recent atmospheric experiments with wireless on board his 
yacht Electra, in the Mediterranean. Mr. Macbeth said that Signor Marconi 
had been unable to conceive of any other explanation of the fact that, 
during his experiments he had picked up magnetic wavelengths of 150,000 
metres, whereas the maximum length of wave-production in the world today is 
14,000 metres. The regularity of the signals, Mr. Macbeth declared, disposed 
of any assumption that the waves might have been caused by electrical 
disturbance. The signals were unintelligible, con- [236/237] sisting of a 
code, the speaker said, and the only signal recognized was one resembling 
the letter V in the Marconi code." See datum of May 19, 1919. 

But, in the summer of 1921, the planet Mars was far from opposition.(53) The 
magnetic vibrations may have come from some other world. They may have had 
the origin of the sounds that have been heard at regular intervals -- 

The San Salvadors of the sky -- 

And we return to the principle that has been our re-enforcement throughout: 
that existence is infinite serialization, and that, except in particulars, 
it repeats -- 

That the dot that spread upon the western horizon of Lisbon, March 4, 1493, 
cannot be the only ship that comes back from the unknown, cargoed with news 
--(54) 

And it may be Sept. this, nineteen hundred and twenty or thirty something, 
or Feb. that, nineteen hundred and twenty or thirty something else -- and, 
later, see record of it in Eng. Mec., or Sci. Amer., vol. and p. something 
or another -- a speck in the sky of this earth -- the return of somebody 
from a San Salvador of the sky -- and the denial by the heavens themselves, 
which may answer with explosions the vociferations below them, of false 
calculations upon their remotenesses. If the heavens do not participate with 
snow, the skyscrapers will precipitate torn up papers and shirts and skirts, 
too, when the papers give out. 

There will be a procession. Somebody will throw little black pebbles to the 
crowds. Over his procession will fly blue-fringed cupids. Later he will be 
insulted and abused and finally hounded to his death. But, in that 
procession, he will lead by the nose an outrageous thing that should not be: 
about ten feet long, short-winged, waddling on webbed feet.(55) Insult and 
abuse and death -- he will snap his fingers under the nose of the outrageous 
thing. It will be worth a great deal to lead that by the nose and 
demonstrate that such things had been seen in the sky, though they had been 
supposed to be angels. It will be a great moment for somebody. He will come

CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE





THAT the Geo-system is an incubating organism, of which this earth is the 
nucleus -- but an organism that is so strongly characterized by conditions 
and features of its own that likening it to any object internal to it is the 
interpreting of a thing in terms of a constituent -- so that we think of an 
organism that is incompletely, or absurdly inadequately, expressible in 
terms of the egg-like and the larval and other forms of the immature -- a 
geo-nucleated system that is dependent upon its externality as, in one way 
or another, is every similar, but lesser and included, thing -- stimulated 
by flows of force that are now said to be meteoric, though many so-called 
"meteoric" streams seem more likely to be electric, that radiate from the 
umbilical channels of its constellations -- vitalized by its sun, which is 
itself replenished by the comets, which, coming from external reservoirs of 
force, impart to the sun their freightages, and, unaffected by gravitation, 
return to an external existence, some of them even touching the sun, but 
showing no indication of supposed solar attraction. 

In a technical sense we give up the doctrine of Evolution. Ours is an 
expression upon Super-embryonic Development, in one enclosed system. Ours is 
an expression upon Design underlying and manifesting in all things within 
this one system, with a Final Designer left out, because we know of no 
designing force that is not itself the product of remoter design. In terms 
of our own experience we cannot think of an ultimate designer, any more than 
we can think of ultimacy in any other respect. But we are discussing a 
system that, in our conception, is not a final entity; so then no 
metaphysical expression upon it is required. 

I point out that this expression of ours is not meant for aid and comfort to 
the reactionaries of the type of Col. W.J. Bryan, for instance; it is not 
altogether anti-Darwinism: the concept of Development replaces the concept 
of Evolution, but we accept the process of Selection, not to anything 
loosely known as Environ- [239/240] ment, but relatively to underlying 
Schedule and Design, predetermined and supervised, as it were, but by 
nothing that we conceive of in anthropomorphic terms.(1) 

I define what I mean by dynamic design, in the development of any embryonic 
thing: a pre-determined, or not accidental, or not irresponsible, passage 
along a schedule of phases to a climax of unification of many parts. Some of 
the aspects of this process are the simultaneous varying of parts, with 
destiny, and not with independence, for their rule, or with future co-
ordinations and functions for their goal; and their survival while still 
incipient, not because they are the fittest relatively to contemporaneous 
environment, so not because of usefulness or advantage in the present, 
inasmuch as at first they are not only functionless but also discordant with 
established relations, but surviving because they are in harmony with the 
dynamic plan of a whole being: and the presence of forces of suppression, or 
repression, as well as forces of stimulation and protection, so that parts 
are held back, or are not permitted to develop before their time. 

If we accept that these circumstances of embryonic development are the 
circumstances of all wider development, within one enclosed system, the 
doctrine of Darwinian Evolution, as applied generally, will, in our minds, 
have to be replaced by an expression upon Super-embryonic Development, and 
Darwinism, unmodified, will become to us one more of the insufficiencies of 
the past. Darwinism concerns itself with the adaptations of the present, and 
does heed the part that the past has played, but, in Darwinism, there is no 
place for the influence of the future upon the present. 

Consider any part of an embryonic thing -- the heart of an embryo -- and at 
first it is only a loop. It will survive, and it will be nourished in its 
functionless incipiency; also it will not be permitted to become a fully 
developed heart before its scheduled time arrives; its circumstances are 
dominated by what it will be in the future. The eye of an embryo is a better 
instance. 

Consider anything of a sociologic nature that has ever grown: that there 
never has been an art, science, religion, invention that was not at first 
out of accord with established environment, visionary, preposterous in the 
light of later standards, useless in its incipiency, and resisted by 
established forces so that, seem- [240/241] ingly animating it and 
protectively underlying it, there may have been something that in spite of 
its unfitness made it survive for future usefulness. Also there are data for 
the acceptance of all things, in wider being, are held back as well as 
protected and prepared for, and not permitted to develop before comes 
scheduled time. Langley's flying machine makes me think of something of the 
kind -- that this machine was premature; that it appeared a little before 
the era of aviation upon this earth, and that therefore Langley could not 
fly. But this machine was capable of flying, because, some years later, 
Curtis did fly in it.(2) Then one thinks that the Wright Brothers were 
successful, because they did synchronize with a scheduled time. I have heard 
that it is questionable that Curtis made no alterations in Langley's 
machine.(3) There is no lack of instances. One of the greatest of secrets 
that have eventually been found out was for ages blabbed by all the pots and 
kettles in the world -- but that the secret of the steam engine could not, 
to the lowliest of intellects, or to suppositiously highest of intellects, 
more than adumbratively reveal itself until came the time for its co-
ordination with the other phenomena and the requirements of the Industrial 
Age. And coal that was stored in abundance near the surface of the ground -- 
and the needs of dwellers over coal mines, veins of which were often exposed 
upon the surface of the ground, for fuel -- but that this secret, too, was 
obvious, too, could not be revealed until the coming of the Industrial Age. 
Then the building of factories, the inventing of machines, the digging of 
coal, and the use of steam, all appearing by simultaneous variation, and co-
ordinating. Shores of North America -- nowadays, with less hero-worship than 
formerly, historians tell us that, to English and French fishermen, the 
coast of Newfoundland was well-known, long before the year 1492; 
nevertheless, to the world in general, it was not, or, according to our 
acceptances, could not be, known. About the year 1500, a Portuguese fleet 
was driven by storms to the coast of Brazil, and returned to Europe. Then 
one thinks that likely enough, before the year 1492, other vessels had been 
so swept to the coasts of the western hemisphere, and had returned -- but 
that data of westward lands could not emerge from the suppressions of the 
era -- but that the data did survive, or were preserved for future 
usefulness -- that there are [241/242] "Thou shalt nots" engraved upon 
something underlying all things, and then effacing, when phases pass away. 

We conceive now of all buildings -- within one enclosed system -- in terms 
of embryonic building, and of all histories as local aspects of Super-
embryonic Development. Cells of an embryo build falsely and futilely, in the 
sense that what they construct will be only temporary and will be out of 
adjustment later. If however there are conditions by which successive stages 
must be traversed before the arrival of maturity, ours is an expression upon 
the false and the futile, in which case these terms, as derogations, should 
not be applied. We see that the cells that build have no basis of their own; 
that for their formations there is nothing of reason and necessity of their 
own, because they flourish in other formations quite as well. We see that 
they need nothing of basis, nor of guidance of their own, because basis and 
guidance are of the essence of the whole. All are responses, or correlates, 
to a succession of commandments, as it were, or of dominant, directing, 
supervising spirits of different eras: that they take on appearances that 
are concordant with the general gastrula era, changing when comes the 
stimulus to agree with the reptilian era, and again responding harmoniously 
when comes the time of the mammalian era. It is in accordance with our 
experience that never has human mind, scientific, religious, philosophic, 
formulated one basic thought, one finally true law, principle, or major 
premise from which guidance could be deduced. If any thought were true and 
final it would include the deduced. We conceive that there has been 
guidance, just the same, if human beings be conceived of as cellular units 
in one developing organism; and that human minds no more need foundations of 
their own than need the super-embryonic cells that build so preposterously, 
according to standards of later growth, but build as they are guided to 
build. In this view, human reason is tropism, or response to stimuli, and 
reasoning is the trial-and-error process of the most primitive unicellular 
organisms, a susceptibility to underlying mandates, then a groping in 
perhaps all possible distortions until adjustment with underlying 
requirements is reached. In this view, then, though there are, for instance, 
no atoms in the Daltonian sense, if in service of a building science, the 
[242/243] false doctrine of the atoms be needed, the mind that responds, 
perhaps not to stimulus, but to requirement, which seems to be a negative 
stimulus, and so conceives, is in adjustment and reaches the state known as 
success. I accept, myself, that there may be Final Truth, and that it may be 
attainable, but never in a service that is local or special in any one 
science or nation or world. 

It is our expression that temporary isolations characterize embryonic growth 
and super-embryonic growth quite as distinctly as do expansions and co-
ordinations. Local centers of development in an egg -- and they are isolated 
before they sketch out attempting relations. Or in wider being -- hemisphere 
isolated from hemisphere, and nation from nation -- then the breaking down 
of barriers -- the appearance of Japan out of obscurity -- threads of a 
military plasm are cast across an ocean by the United States. 

Shafts of light that have pierced the obscurity surrounding planets -- and 
something like a star shines in Aristarchus of the moon. Embryonic heavens 
that have dreamed -- and that their mirages will be realized some day. 
Sounds and an interval; sounds and the same interval; sounds again -- that 
there is one integrating organism and that we have heard its pulse. [243]

3. When Langley was given credit as having invented a man-carrying airplane 
by the Smithsonian Institution, (based in part of the flight of Langley's 
aircraft by Glenn Hammond Curtiss in 1914), claims were raised that the 
machine flown in 1914 was not Langley's original airplane but had been 
extensively modified. On October 7 and December 8, 1903, Langley's airplane 
was launched over the Potomac, crashing in both instances; but, the failures 
were attributed to the launching mechanism rather than the aircraft itself. 
Langley's experiments, sponsored by the government, were abandoned; and, 
though successful at Kitty-Hawk on December 17, 1903, the Wright brothers 
did not attract much attention with their initial flights. Curtiss repaired 
the Langley airplane and equipped it with floats, so that it could take-off 
and land from the level surface of a lake, (instead of being launched from 
an elevated rail, as had been tried in 1903). The only change to the 
original engine was a new carburettor, as no one knew how to operate the 
original mechanism. Curtiss was testing the aircraft, on a trial run, to see 
if it was balanced and how it worked with the added air-drag upon the floats 
and the extra weight from the floats and repaired wings. On this trial, the 
airplane flew successfully. Curtiss proceeded to make some modifications 
with subsequent flights; and, these latter changes were cited by critics, 
including Orville Wright, who denied that the Langley airplane could be 
flown without extensive modifications to its wings, engine, and 
construction. To support the claims of the Wright patents, "movable 
ailerons" were said to be "decisive" and necessary for an airplane to be 
able to be flown; and, Orville Wright blamed the 1903 crashes upon the 
trusses, (not on the launching mechanism), of Langley's aircraft. It did not 
seem to matter that Langley had built and flown self-propelled models, which 
were extremely stable and could be flown without a pilot. The success of the 
Wright Brothers was in developing "wing warping," which gave "adequate 
lateral control even to an unstable aeroplane." The 1914 tests were worse 
than useless, according to Bentley, who complained that only a duplicate of 
Langley's original craft would have settled the silly dispute of who first 
invented a working airplane, though the Wright Brothers were clearly 
acknowledged as the first to succeed in their efforts. "Attacks 1914 test of

CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX





FEB. 7, 1922 -- an explosion "of startling intensity" in the sky of the 
northwestern point of the London Triangle (Nature, Feb. 23, 1922).(1) 

Repeating phenomena in a local sky -- in L'Astronomie, 36-201, it is said 
that, at Orsay (Seine-et-Oise) Feb. 15, 1922, a detonation was heard in the 
sky, and that 9 hours later a similar sound was heard, and that an 
illumination was seen in the sky.(2) It is said that, 10 nights later, at 
Verneuil, in the adjoining province, Oise, a great, fiery mass was seen 
falling from the sky. 

March 12, 1922 -- rocks that had been falling "from the clouds," for three 
weeks, at Chico, a town in an "earthquake region" in California (New York 
Times, March 12, 1922).(3) Large, smooth rocks that "seemed to come straight 
from the clouds." 

In the San Francisco Chronicle, in issues dating from the 12th to the 18th 
of March -- clippings sent to me by Mr. Maynard Shipley, writer and lecturer 
upon scientific subjects, if there be such subjects -- the accounts are of 
stones that, for four months, had been falling intermittently from the sky, 
almost always upon the roofs of two adjoining warehouses, in Chico, but, 
upon one occasion, falling three blocks away: "a downpour of oval-shaped 
stones;" "a heavy shower of warm rocks."(4) San Francisco Call, March 16 -- 
"warm rocks."(5) It is said that crowds gathered, and that upon the 17th of 
March a "deluge" of rocks fell upon a crowd, injuring one person.(6) The 
police "combed" all surroundings: the only explanation that they could think 
of was that somebody was firing stones from a catapult.(7) One person was 
suspected by them, but, upon the 14th of March, a rock fell when he was 
known not to be in the neighborhood.(8) 

The circumstances point to one origin of these stones, stationary in the 
sky, above the town of Chico. 

Upon the first of January, 1922, the attention of Marshal J. A. [244/245] 
Peck, of Chico, had been called to the phenomena. After investigating more 
than two months, he said (San Francisco Examiner, March 14): "I could find 
no one through my investigations who could explain the matter. At various 
times I have heard and seen the stones. I think someone with a machine is to 
blame."(9) 

Prof. C.K. Studley, vice-president of the Teachers' College, Chico, is 
quoted in the Examiner: 

"Some of the rocks are so large that they could not be thrown by any 
ordinary means. One of the rocks weighs 16 ounces. They are not of meteoric 
origin, as seems to have been hinted, because two of them show signs of 
cementation, either natural or artificial, and no meteoric factor was ever 
connected with a cement factory." 

Once upon a time, dogmatists supposed, asserted, angrily declared sometimes, 
that all stones that fall from the sky must be of "true meteoric material." 
That time is now of the past. See Nature, 105-759 -- a description of two 
dissimilar stones, cemented together, seen to fall from the sky, at 
Cumberland Falls, Ky., April 9, 1919.(10) 

Miriam Allen de Ford (P.O. Box 573, San Francisco, Cal. -- or see the 
Readers' Guide) has sent me an account of her own observations. About the 
middle of March, 1922, she was in Chico, and investigated. Went to the scene 
of the falling rocks; discussed the subject with persons in the crowd. 
"While I was discussing it with some bystanders, I looked up at the 
cloudless sky, and suddenly saw a rock falling straight down, as if becoming 
visible when it came near enough. This rock struck the roof with a thud, and 
bounced off on the track beside the warehouse, and I could not find it." "I 
learned that the rocks had been falling since July, 1921, though no 
publicity arose until November." 

There have been other phenomena at Chico. In the New York Times, Sept. 2, 
1878, upon the 20th of August, 1878, according to the Chico Record, a great 
number of small fishes fell from the sky, at Chico, covering the roof of a 
store, and falling in the streets, upon an area of several acres.(11) 
Perhaps the most important observation is that they fell from a cloudless 
sky. Several occurrences are listed as earthquakes, by Dr. Holden, in 
[245/246] his Catalog; but the detonations that were heard in Oroville, a 
town near Chico, Jan. 2, 1887, are said, in the Monthly Weather Review, 
1887-24, to have been in the sky.(12) Upon the night of March 5-6, 1885, 
according to the Chico Chronicle, a large object, of very hard material, 
weighing several tons, fell from the sky, near Chico (Monthly Weather 
Review, March, 1885).(13) In the year 1893, an iron object, said to be 
meteoritic, was found at Oroville (Mems. Nat. Acad. Sci., 13-345).(14) 

My own idea is either that there is land over the town of Chico, and not far 
away, inasmuch as objects from it fall with a very narrow distribution, or 
that far away, and therefore invisible, there may be land from which objects 
have been carried in a special current to one very small part of this 
earth's surface. If anyone would like to read an account of stones that fell 
intermittently for several days, clearly enough as if in a current, or in a 
field of special force, of some kind, at Livet, near Clavaux, France, 
December, 1842, see the London Times, Jan. 13, 1843.(15) There have been 
other such occurrences. Absurdly, when they were noticed at all, they were 
supposed to be psychic phenomena. I conceive that there is no more of the 
psychic to these occurrences than there is to the arrival of seeds from the 
West Indies upon the coast of England.(16) Stones that fell upon a house, 
near the Pantheon, Paris, for three weeks, January, 1849 -- see Dr. 
Wallace's Miracles and Modern Spiritualism, p. 284.(17) Several times, in 
the course of this book, I have tried to be reasonable. I have asked what 
such repeating phenomena in one local sky do indicate, if they do not 
indicate fixed origins in the sky. And if such occurrences, supported by 
many data in other fields, do not indicate the stationariness of this earth, 
with new lands not far away -- tell me what it is all about. The falling 
stones of Chico -- new lands in the sky -- or what? 

Boston Transcript, March 21, 1922 -- clipping sent to me by Mr. J. David 
Stern, Editor and Publisher of the Camden (N.J.) Daily Courier -- 

"Geneva, March 21 -- During a heavy snow-storm in the Alps recently 
thousands of exotic insects resembling spiders, caterpillars and huge ants 
fell on the slopes and quickly died. Local naturalists are unable to explain 
the phenomenon, but one theory is [246/247] that the insects were blown in 
on the wind from a warmer climate."(18) 

The fall of unknown insects in a snow storm is not the circumstance that I 
call most attention to. It is worth noting that I have records of half a 
dozen similar occurrences in the Alps, usually about the last of January, 
but the striking circumstance is that insects of different species and of 
different specific gravities fell together. The conventional explanation is 
that a wind, far away, raised a great variety of small objects, and 
segregated them according to specific gravity, so that twigs and grasses 
fell in one place, dust some other place, pebbles somewhere else, and 
insects farther along somewhere. This would be very fine segregation. There 
was no very fine segregation in this occurrence. Something of a seasonal, or 
migratory, nature, from some other world, localized in the sky, relatively 
to the Alps, is suggested. 

May 4, 1922 -- discovery, by F. Burnerd, of three long mounds in the lunar 
crater Archimedes. See the English Mechanic, 115-194, 218, 268, 278.(19) It 
seems likely that these constructions had been recently built. 

St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, May 18, 1922 (Associated Press) -- particles of 
matter falling continuously for several days.(20) "The phenomenon is 
supposed here to be of volcanic origin, but all the volcanoes of the West 
Indies are reported as quiet." 

New York Tribune, July 3, 1922, that, for the fourth time in one month, a 
great volume of water, or a "cloudburst," had poured from one local sky, 
near Carbondale, Pa.(21) 

Oct. 15, 1922 -- a large quantity of white substance that fell upon the 
shores of Lake Michigan, near Chicago. It fell upon the clothes of hundreds 
of persons, fell upon the campus of Northwestern University, likely enough 
fell upon the astronomical observatory of the University. It occurred to one 
of these hundreds, or thousands, or persons to collect some of this 
substance. He is Mr. L.A. Hopkins, 111 West Jackson Blvd., Chicago. He sent 
me a sample. I think that it is spider web, because it is viscous: when 
burned it chars with the crinkled effect of burned hair and feathers, and 
the odor is similar. But it is strong, tough substance, of a cottony 
texture, when rolled up. The interesting circumstance to me is that similar 
substance has fallen frequently [247/248] upon this earth, in October, but 
that, in terrestrial terms, seasonal migration of aëronautical spiders can 
not be thought of, because in the tropics and in Australia, as well as in 
the United States and in England, such showers have occurred in October. 
Then something seasonal, but seasonal in an extra-mundane sense, is 
suggested. See the Scientific Australian, Sept., 1916 -- that, from October 
5 to 29, 1915, an enormous fall of similar substance occurred upon a region 
of thousands of square miles, in Australia.(22) 

Time after time, in data that I have only partly investigated, occur 
declarations that, during devastations commonly known as "earthquakes," in 
Chile, the sky has flamed, or that "strange illuminations" in the sky have 
been seen. In the Bull. Seis. Soc. Amer., for instance, some of these 
descriptions have been noted, and have been hushed up with the explanation 
that they were the reports of unscientific persons.(23) 

Latest of the great quakes in Chile -- 1,500 dead "recovered" in one of the 
cities of the Province of Atacama. New York Tribune, Nov. 15, 1922 -- 
"Again, today, severe earthquakes shook the Province of Coquimbo and other 
places and strange illuminations were observed over the sea off La Serena 
and Copiapo."(24) 

Back to Crater Mountain, Arizona, for an impression -- but far more 
impressive are similar data as to these places of Atacama and Copiapo, in 
Chile. In the year 1845, M. Darlu, of Valparaiso, read, before the French 
Academy, a paper, in which he asserted that, in the desert of Atacama, which 
begins at Copiapo, meteorites are strewn upon the ground in such numbers 
that they are met at every step. If these objects fell all at one time in 
this earthquake region, we have another instance conceivably of mere 
coincidence between the aërial and the seismic. If they fell at different 
times, the indications are of a fixed relationship between this part of 
Chile and a center somewhere in the sky of falling objects commonly called 
"meteorites" and of cataclysms that devastate this part of Chile with 
concussions commonly called "earthquakes." There is a paper upon this 
subject in Science, 14-434. Here the extreme abundance asserted by M. Darlu 
is questioned: it is said that only thirteen of these objects were known to 
science.(25) But, according to descriptions, four of them are stones, or 
stone-irons, differing so that, in the opinion of the writer, and not 
[248/249] merely so interpreted by me, these four objects fell at different 
times. Then the nine others are considered. They are nickel-irons. They, 
too, are different, one from another. So then it is said that these thirteen 
objects, all from one place, were, with reasonable certainty, the products 
of different falls. 

Behind concepts that sometimes seem delirious, I offer -- a reasonable 
certainty -- 

That, existing somewhere beyond this earth, perhaps beyond a revolving shell 
in which the nearby stars are openings, there are stationary regions, from 
which, upon many occasions, have emanated "meteors," sometimes exploding 
catastrophically over Atacama, Chile, for instance. Coasts of South America 
have reeled, and the heavens have been afire. Reverberations in the sky -- 
the ocean has responded with islands. Between sky and earth of Chile there 
have been flaming intimacies of destruction and slaughter and woe -- 

Silence that is conspiracy to hide past ignorance; that is imbecility, or 
that is the unawareness of the profoundest hypnosis. 

Hypnosis -- 

That the seismologists, too, have functioned in preserving the illusion of 
this earth's isolation, and by super-embryonic processes have been 
hypnotized into oblivion of a secret that has been proclaimed with 
avalanches of fire from the heavens, and that has babbled from brooks of the 
blood of crushed populations, and that is monumentalized in ruins.
