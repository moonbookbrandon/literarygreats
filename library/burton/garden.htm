                  The Perfumed Garden by Sheikh Nefzaoui

                     Translated by Sir Richard Burton

   
    Note to the 1886 Edition
    
   The Perfumed Garden was translated into French before the year 1850,
   by a staff officer of the French army in Algeria. An autograph
   edition, printed in the italic character, was printed in 1876, but, as
   only twenty-five copies are said to have been made, the book is both
   rare and costly, while, from the peculiarity of its type, it is
   difficult and fatiguing to read. An admirable reprint has, however,
   been recently issued in Paris, with the translator's notes and
   remarks, revised and corrected in the light of the fuller knowledge of
   Algeria which has been acquired since the translation was made. From
   that last edition the present translation (an exact and literal one)
   has been made, and it is the first time that the work - one of the
   most remarkable of its kind - has appeared in the English language.

   
Notes of the Translator Respecting the Sheikh Nefzaoui

   The name of the Sheikh has become known to posterity as the author of
   this work, which is the only one attributed to him.
   
   In spite of the subject-matter of the book, and the manifold errors
   found in it and caused by the negligence and ignorance of the
   copyists, it is manifest that this treatise comes from the pen of a
   man of great erudition, who had a better knowledge in general of
   literature and medicine than is commonly found with Arabs.
   
   According to the historical notice contained in the first leaves of
   the manuscript, and notwithstanding the apparent error respecting the
   name oft he Bey who was reigning in Tunis, it may be presumed that
   this work was written in the beginning of the sixteenth century, about
   the year 925 of the Hegira.
   
   As regards the birthplace of the author, it may be taken for granted,
   considering that the Arabs habitually joined the name of their
   birth-place to their own, that he was born at Nefzaoua, a town
   situated in the district of that name on the shore of the lake Sebkha
   Melrir, in the south of the kingdom of Tunis.
   
   The Sheikh himself records that he lived in Tunis, and it is most
   probable the book was written in that city. According to tradition, a
   particular motive induced him to undertake a work entirely at variance
   with his simple tastes and retired habits.
   
   His knowledge of law and literature, as well as of medicine, having
   been reported to the Bey of Tunis, this ruler wished to invest him
   with the office of Cadi, although he was unwilling to occupy himself
   with public functions.
   
   As he, however, desired not to give the Bey cause for offence, whereby
   he might have incurred danger, he merely requested a short delay, in
   order to be able to finish a work which he had in hand.
   
   This having been granted, he set himself to compose the treatise which
   was then Occupying his mind, and which, becoming known, drew so much
   attention upon the author, that it became henceforth impossible to
   confide to him functions of the nature of those of a Cadi.
   
   But this version, which is not supported by any authenticated proof,
   and which represents the Sheikh Nefzaoui as a man of light morals,
   does not seem to be admissible. One need only glance at the book to be
   convinced that its author was animated by the most praiseworthy
   intentions, and that, far from being in fault, he deserves gratitude
   for the services he has rendered to humanity. Contrary to the habits
   of the Arabs, there exists no commentary on this book; the reason may,
   perhaps, be found in the nature of the subject of which it treats, and
   which may have frightened, unnecessarily, the serious and the
   studious. I say unnecessarily, because this book, more than any other,
   ought to have commentaries; grave questions are treated in it, and
   open out a large field for work and meditation.
   
   What can be more important, in fact, than the study of the principles
   upon which rest the happiness of man and woman, by reason of their
   mutual relations; relations which are themselves dependent upon
   character, health, temperament and the constitution, all of which it
   is the duty of philosophers to study.
   
   In doubtful and difficult cases, and where the ideas of the author did
   not seem to be clearly set out, I have not hesitated to look for
   enlightenment to the savants of sundry confessions, and by their kind
   assistance many difficulties, which I believed insurmountable, were
   conquered. lam glad to render them here my thanks.
   
   Amongst the authors who have treated of similar subjects, there is not
   one that can be entirely compared with the Sheikh; for his book
   reminds you, at the same time, of Aretin, of the book Conjugal Love,
   and of Rabelais. But what makes this treatise unique as a book of its
   kind, is the seriousness with which the most lascivious and obscene
   matters are presented. It is evident that the author is convinced of
   the importance of his subject, and that the desire to be of use to his
   fellowmen is the sole motive of his efforts.
   
   With the view to giving more weight to his recommendations, he does
   not hesitate to multiply his religious citations, and in many cases
   invokes even the authority of the Koran, the most sacred book of the
   Mussulmans.
   
   It may be assumed that this book, without being exactly a compilation,
   is not entirely due to the genius of the Sheikh Nefzaoui, and that
   several parts may have been borrowed from Arabian and Indian writers.
   For instance, all the record of Mo&aced;ailama and of Chedja is taken
   from the work of Mohammed ben Djerir el Taberi; the description of the
   different positions for coition, as well as the movements applicable
   to them, are borrowed from Indian works; finally, the book Birds and
   Flowers by Azeddine el Mocadecci seems to have been consulted with
   respect to the interpretation of dreams. But an author certainly is to
   be commended for having surrounded himself with the lights of former
   savants, and it would be ingratitude not to acknowledge the benefit
   which his books have conferred upon people who were still in their
   infancy in the art of love.
   
   It is only to be regretted that this work, so complete in many
   respects, is defective in so fir as it makes no mention of a custom
   too common with the Arabs not to deserve particular attention. I speak
   of the taste so universal with the old Greeks and Romans, namely, the
   preference they give to a boy before a woman, or even to treat the
   latter as a boy.
   
   There might have been given on this subject sound advice as well with
   regard to the pleasures mutually enjoyed by the women called tribades.
   The same reticence has been observed by the author with regard to
   bestiality. Nevertheless he does speak, in one story (i.e. `The
   History of Zohra', in the concluding chapter of the work), of the
   mutual caresses of women; and he relates an anecdote concerning a
   woman who provoked the caresses of an ass [which has been eliminated
   from the present edition], thus revealing that he knew of such
   matters.
   
   Lastly, the Sheikh does not mention the pleasures which the mouth or
   the hand of a pretty woman can give, nor the cunnilinges.
   
   What may have been the motive for these omissions? The author's
   silence cannot be attributed to ignorance, for in the course of his
   work he has given proofs of an erudition too extended and various to
   permit a suspicion of his knowledge.
   
   Should we look for the cause of this gap to the contempt which the
   Mussulman in reality feels for woman, and owing to which he may think
   that it would be degrading to his dignity as a man to descend to
   caresses otherwise regulated than by the laws of nature? Or did the
   author, perhaps, avoid the mention of similar matters out of fear that
   he might be suspected of sharing tastes which many people look upon as
   depraved?
   
   However this may be, the book contains much useful information and a
   large number of curious cases, and I have undertaken the translation
   because, as the Sheikh Nefzaoui says in his preamble: `I swear before
   God, certainly! the knowledge of this book is necessary. It will be
   only the shamefully ignorant, the enemy of all science, who does not
   read it, or who turns it into ridicule.'

                                      
INTRODUCTION

  General Remarks about Coition
  
   PRAISE BE GIVEN TO God, who has placed man's greatest pleasure in the
   natural parts of woman, and has destined the natural parts of man to
   afford the greatest enjoyment to woman.
   
   He has not endowed the parts of woman with any pleasurable or
   satisfactory feeling until the same have been penetrated by the
   instrument of the male; and likewise the sexual organs of man know
   neither rest nor quietness until they have entered those of the
   female.
   
   Hence the mutual operation. There takes place between the two actors
   wrestling, intertwinings, a kind of animated conflict. Owing to the
   contact of the lower parts of the two bellies, the enjoyment soon
   comes to pass. The man is at work as with a pestle, while the woman
   seconds him by lascivious movements; finally comes the ejaculation.
   
   The kiss on the mouth, on the two cheeks, upon the neck, as well as
   the sucking up of flesh lips, are gifts of God, destined to provoke
   erection at the favourable moment. God also is it who has embellished
   the chest of the woman with breasts, has furnished her with a double
   chin, and has given brilliant colours to her cheeks.
   
   He has also gifted her with eyes that inspire love, and with eyelashes
   like polished blades.
   
   He has furnished her with a rounded belly and a beautiful navel, and
   with a majestic crupper; and all these wonders are borne up by the
   thighs. It is between these latter that God has placed the arena of
   the combat; when the same is provided with ample flesh, it resembles
   the head of a lion. It is called the vulva. Oh! how many men's deaths
   lie at her door? Amongst them how many heroes!
   
   God has furnished this object with a mouth, a tongue, two lips; it is
   like the impression of the hoof of the gazelle in the sands of the
   desert.
   
   The whole is supported by two marvellous columns, testifying to the
   might and the wisdom of God; they are not too long nor too short; and
   they are graced with knees, calves, ankles, and heels, upon which rest
   precious rings.
   
   Then the Almighty has plunged woman into a sea of splendours, of
   voluptuousness, and of delights, and covered her with precious
   vestments, with brilliant girdles and provoking smiles.
   
   So let us praise and exalt him who has created woman and her beauties,
   with her appetizing flesh; who has given her hails, a beautiful
   figure, a bosom with breasts which are swelling, and amorous ways,
   which awaken desires.
   
   The Master of the Universe has bestowed upon them the empire of
   seduction; all men, weak or strong, are subjected to a weakness for
   the love of woman. Through woman we have society or dispersion,
   sojourn or emigration.
   
   The state of humility in which are the hearts of those who love and
   are separated from the object of their love, makes their hearts burn
   with love's fire; they are oppressed with a feeling of servitude,
   contempt and misery; they suffer under the vicissitudes of their
   passion: and all this as a consequence of their burning desire for
   contact.
   
   I, the servant of God, am thankful to him that no one can help falling
   in love with beautiful women, and that no one can escape the desire to
   possess them, neither by change, nor flight, nor separation.
   
   I testify that there is only one God, and that he has no associate. I
   shall adhere to this precious testimony to the day of the last
   judgment.
   
   I likewise testify as to our lord and master, Mohammed, the servant
   and ambassador of God, the greatest of the prophets (the benediction
   and pity of God be with him and with his family and disciples!). I
   keep prayers and benedictions for the day of retribution, that
   terrible moment.
   
The Origin of This Work

   I have written this magnificent work after a small book called The
   Torch of the World, which treats of the mysteries of generation.
   
   This latter work came to the knowledge of the Vizir of our master,
   Abd-el-Aziz, the ruler of Tunis.
   
   This illustrious Vizir was his poet, his companion, his friend and
   private secretary. He was good in council, true, sagacious and wise,
   the best learned man of his time, and well acquainted with all things.
   He called himself Mohammed ben Ouana ez Zounaoui, and traced his
   origin from Zounaoua. He had been brought up at Algiers, and in that
   town our master Abd-el-Aziz el Hafsi had made his acquaintance.
   
   On the day when Algiers was taken, that ruler took flight with him to
   Tunis (which land may God preserve in his power till the day of
   resurrection), and named him his Grand Vizir.
   
   When the above-mentioned book came into his hands, he sent for me, and
   invited me pressingly to come and see him. I went forthwith to his
   house, and he received me most honourably.
   
   Three days after, he came to me and, showing me my book, said, `This
   is your work.' Seeing me blush, he added, `You need not be ashamed;
   everything you have said in it is true; no one need be shocked at your
   words. Moreover, you are not the first who has treated of this matter;
   and I swear by God that it is necessary to know this book. It is only
   the shameless bore and the enemy of all science who will not read it,
   or will make fun of it. But there are sundry things which you will
   have to treat about yet.' I asked him what these things were, and he
   answered, `I wish that you would add to the work a supplement,
   treating of the remedies of which you have said nothing, and adding
   all the facts appertaining thereto, omitting nothing. You will
   describe in the same the motives of the act of generation, as well as
   the matters that prevent it. You will mention the means for undoing
   spells (aiguillettes), and the way to increase the size of the virile
   member, when too small, and to make it resplendent. You will further
   cite those means which remove the unpleasant smells from the armpits
   and the natural parts of women, and those which will contract those
   parts. You will further speak of pregnancy, so as to make your book
   perfect and wanting in nothing. And, finally, you will have done your
   work, if your book satisfy all wishes.'
   
   T replied to the Vizir: `Oh, my master, all you have said here is not
   difficult to do, if it is the pleasure of God on high.'
   
   I forthwith went to work with the composition of this book, imploring
   the assistance of God (may he pour his blessing on his prophet, and
   may happiness and pity be with him).
   
   I have called this work, The Perfumed Garden for the Souls Recreation
   (Er Roud el Âater p'nezaha el Khater).
   
   And we pray to God, who directs everything for the best (and there is
   no other God than He, and there is nothing good that does not come
   from Him), to lend us His help, and lead us in good ways; for there is
   no power nor joy but in the high and mighty God.
   
   I have divided this book into chapters, in order to make it easier
   reading for the taleb (student) who wishes to learn, and to facilitate
   his search for what he wants. Each chapter relates to a particular
   subject, be it physical, or anecdotal, or treating of the wiles and
   deceits of women.

                                      
CHAPTER 1

  Concerning Praiseworthy Men
  
   LEARN, O Vizir (God's blessing be upon you), that there are different
   sorts of men and women; that amongst these are those who are worthy of
   praise and those who deserve reproach.
   
   When a meritorious man finds himself near to women, his member grows,
   gets strong, vigorous and hard; he is not quick to discharge, and
   after the trembling caused by the emission of the sperm, he is soon
   stiff again.
   
   Such a man is liked and appreciated by women; this is because the
   woman loves the man only for the sake of coition. His member should,
   therefore, be of ample dimensions and length. Such a man ought to be
   broad in the chest, and heavy in the crupper; he should know how to
   regulate his emission, and be ready as to erection; his member should
   reach to the end of the canal of the female, and completely fill the
   same in all its parts. Such an one will be well beloved by women, for,
   as the poet says:
   
     I have seen women trying to find in young men
     The durable qualities which grace the man of full power,
     The beauty, the enjoyment, the reserve, the strength,
     The full-formed member providing a lengthened coition,
     A heavy crupper, a slowly coming emission,
     A lightsome chest, as it were floating upon them;
     The spermal ejaculation slow to arrive, so as
     To furnish forth a long drawn-out enjoyment.
     His member soon to be prone again for erection,
     To ply the plane again and again and again on their vulvas,
     Such is the man whose cult gives pleasure to women,
     And who will ever stand high in their esteem.
     
    Qualities Which Women Are Looking For in Men
    
   The tale goes, that on a certain day, Abd-el-Melik ben Merouane, went
   to see Leilla, his mistress, and put various questions to her. Amongst
   other things, he asked her what were the qualities which women looked
   for in men.
   
   Leilla answered him: `Oh, my master, they must have cheeks like ours.'
   `And what besides?' said Ben Merouane. She continued: `And hairs like
   ours; finally they should be like to you, O prince of believers, for,
   surely, if a man is not strong and rich he will obtain nothing from
   women.'
   
    Various Lengths of the Virile Member
    
   The virile member, to please women, must have at most a length of the
   breadth of twelve fingers, or three handbreadths, and at least six
   fingers, or a hand and a half breadth.
   
   There are men with members of twelve fingers, or three hand-breadths;
   others of ten fingers, or two and a half hands. And others measure
   eight fingers, or two hands. A man whose member is of less dimensions
   cannot please women.
   
    The Use of Perfumes in Coition. The History of Mo&cced;ilama
    
   The use of perfumes, by man as well as by woman, excites to the act of
   copulation. The woman, inhaling the perfumes employed by the man,
   becomes intoxicated; and the use of scents has often proved a strong
   help to man, and assisted him in getting possession of a woman.
   
   On this subject it is told of Mo&cced;ilama, the impostor, the son of
   Kaiss - whom God may curse!), that he pretended to have the gift of
   prophecy, and imitated the Prophet of God (blessings and salutations
   to him). For which reasons he and a great number of Arabs have
   incurred the ire of the Almighty.
   
   Mo&cced;ilama, the son of Kaiss, the impostor, misconstrued likewise
   the Koran by his lies and impostures; and on the subject of a chapter
   of the Koran, which the angel Gabriel (hail be to him) had brought to
   the Prophet (the mercy of God and hail to him), people of bad faith
   had gone to see Mo&cced;ilama, who had told them, `To me also has the
   angel Gabriel brought a similar chapter.'
   
   He derided the chapter headed `The Elephant,' saying, `In this chapter
   of the Elephant I see the elephant. What is the elephant? What does it
   mean? What is this quadruped? It has a tail and a long trunk. Surely
   it is a creation of our God, the magnificent.'
   
   The chapter of the Koran named `the kouter' was also an object of
   controversy. He said, `We have given you precious stones for yourself,
   and preference to any other man, but take care not to be proud of
   them.'
   
   Mo&cced;ilama thus perverted sundry chapters in the Koran by his lies
   and his impostures.
   
   He had been at his work when he heard the Prophet (the salutation and
   mercy of God be with him) spoken of. He heard that after he had placed
   his venerable hands upon a bald head, the hair had forthwith sprung up
   again; that when he spat into a pit, the water came in abundantly, and
   that the dirty water turned at once clean and good for drinking; that
   when he spat into an eye that was blind or obscure, the sight was at
   once restored to it, and when he placed his hands upon the head of a
   child, saying, `Live for a century,' the child lived to be a hundred
   years old.
   
   When the disciples of Mo&cced;ilama saw these things or heard speak of
   them, they came to him and said, `Have you no knowledge of Mohammed
   and his doings?' He replied, `I shall do better than that.'
   
   Now, Mo&cced;ilama was an enemy of God, and when he put his luckless
   hand on the head of someone who had not much hair, the man was at once
   quite bald; when he spat into a well with a scanty supply of water,
   sweet as it was, it was turned dirty by the will of God; if he spat
   into a suffering eye, that eye lost its sight at once, and when he
   laid his hand upon the head of an infant, saying, `Live a hundred
   years,' the infant died within an hour.
   
   Observe. my brethren, what happens to those whose eyes remain closed
   to the light, and who are deprived of the assistance of the Almighty!
   
   And thus acted that woman of the Beni-Temim, called Chedjâ el Temimia,
   who pretended to be a prophetess. She had heard of Mo&cced;ilama, and
   he likewise of her.
   
   This woman was powerful, for the Beni-Temim form a numerous tribe. She
   said, `Prophecy cannot belong to two persons. Either he is a prophet,
   and then I and my disciples will follow his laws, or I am a
   prophetess, and then he and his disciples will follow my laws.'
   
   This happened after the death of the Prophet (the salutation and mercy
   of God be with him).
   
   Chedjâ then wrote to Mo&cced;ailama a letter, in which she told him,
   `It is not proper that two persons should at one and the same time
   profess prophecy; it is for one only to be a prophet. We will meet, we
   and our disciples, and examine each other. We shall discuss about that
   which has come to us from God (the Koran), and we will follow the laws
   of him who shall be acknowledged as the true prophet.'
   
   She then closed her letter and gave it to a messenger, saying to him:
   `Betake yourself, with this missive, to Yamama, and give it to
   Mo&cced;ailama ben Kaiss. As for myself, I follow you, with the army.'
   
   Next day the prophetess mounted horse, with her goum, and followed the
   spoor of her envoy. When the latter arrived at Mo&cced;ailama's place,
   he greeted him and gave him the letter.
   
   Mo&cced;ilama opened and read it, and understood its contents. He was
   dismayed, and began to advise with the people of his goum, one after
   another, but he did not see anything in their advice or in their views
   that could rid him of his embarrassment.
   
   While he was in this perplexity, one of the superior men of his goum
   came forward and said to him: `Oh, Mo&cced;ilama, calm your soul and
   cool your eye. I will give you the advice of a father to his son.'
   
   Mo&cced;ilama said to him: `Speak, and may thy words be true.'
   
   And the other one said: `Tomorrow morning erect outside the city a
   tent of coloured brocades, provided with silk furniture of all sorts.
   Fill the tent afterwards with a variety of different perfumes, amber,
   musk, and all sorts of scents, as rose, orange flowers, jonquils,
   jessamine, hyacinth, carnation and other plants. This done, have them
   placed there several gold censers filled with green aloes, ambergris,
   net and so on. Then fix the hangings so that nothing of these perfumes
   can escape out of the tent. Then, when you find the vapour strong
   enough to impregnate water, sit down on your throne, and send for the
   prophetess to come and see you in the tent, where she will be alone
   with you. When you are thus together there, and she inhales the
   perfumes, she will delight in the same, all her bones will be released
   in a soft repose, and finally she will be swooning. When you see her
   thus far gone, ask her to grant you her favours; she will not hesitate
   to accord them. Having once possessed her, you will be freed of the
   embarrassment caused to you by her and her goum.'
   
   Mo&cced;ilama exclaimed: `You have spoken well. As God lives, your
   advice is good and well thought out.' And he had everything arranged
   accordingly.
   
   When he saw that the perfumed vapour was dense enough to impregnate
   the water in the tent he sat down upon his throne and sent for the
   prophetess. On her arrival he gave orders to admit her into the tent;
   she entered and remained alone with him. He engaged her in
   conversation.
   
   While Mo&cced;ilama spoke to her she lost all her presence of mind,
   and became embarrassed and confused.
   
   When he saw her in that state he knew that she desired cohabitation,
   and he said: `Come, rise and let me have possession of you; this place
   has been prepared for that purpose. If you like you may lie on your
   back, or you can place yourself on an fours, or kneel as in prayer,
   with your brow touching the ground, and your crupper in the air,
   forming a tripod. Whichever position you prefer, speak, and you shall
   be satisfied.'
   
   The prophetess answered, `I want it done in all ways. Let the
   revelation of God descend upon me, O Prophet of the Almighty.'
   
   He at once precipitated himself upon her, and enjoyed her as he liked.
   She then said to him, `When I am gone from here, ask my goum to give
   me to you in marriage.'
   
   When she had left the tent and met her disciples, they said to her,
   `What is the result of the conference, O prophetess of God?' and she
   replied, `Mo&cced;ilama has shown me what has been revealed to him,
   and I found it to be the truth, so obey him.'
   
   Then Mo&cced;ilama asked her in marriage from the goum, which was
   accorded to him. When the goum asked about the marriage-dowry of his
   future wife, he told them, `I dispense you from saying the prayer
   aceur (which is said at three or four o'clock). Ever from that time
   the Beni-Temim do not pray at that hour; and when they are asked the
   reason, they answer, `It is on account of our prophetess; she only
   knows the way to the truth.' And, in fact, they recognized no other
   prophet.
   
   On this subject a poet has said:
   
     For us a female prophet has arisen;
     Her laws we follow; for the rest of mankind
     The prophets that appeared were always men.
     
   The death of Mo&cced;ilama was foretold by the prophecy of Abou Beker
   (to whom God be good). He was, in fact, killed by Zeid ben Khettab.
   Other people say it was done by Ouhcha, one of his disciples. God only
   knows whether it was Ouhcha. He himself says on this point, `I have
   killed in my ignorance the best of men, Haman ben Abd el Mosaleb, and
   then I killed the worst of men, Mo&cced;ailama. I hope that God will
   pardon one of these actions in consideration of the other.'
   
   The meaning of these words, `I have killed the best of men', is that
   Ouhcha, before having yet known the prophet, had killed Haman (to whom
   God be good), and having afterwards embraced Islamism, he killed
   Mo&cced;ilama.
   
   As regards Chedjâ el Temimia, she repented by God's grace, and took to
   the Islamitic faith; she married one of the Prophet's followers (God
   be good to her husband).
   
   Thus finishes the story.
   
   The man who deserves favours is, in the eyes of women, the one who is
   anxious to please them. He must be of good presence, excel in beauty
   those around him, be of good shape and well-formed proportions; true
   and sincere in his speech with women; he must likewise be generous and
   brave, not vainglorious, and pleasant in conversation. A slave to his
   promise, he must always keep his word, ever speak the truth, and do
   what he has said.
   
   The man who boasts of his relations with women, of their acquaintance
   and good will to him, is a dastard. He will be spoken of in the next
   chapter.
   
   There is a story that once there lived a King named Mamoum, who had a
   court fool of the name of Bahloul, who amused the princes and Vizirs.
   
   One day this buffoon appeared before the King, who was amusing
   himself. The King bade him to sit down, and then asked him, turning
   away, `Way hast thou come, O son of a bad woman?'
   
   Bahloul answered, `I have come to see what has come to our Lord, whom
   may God make victorious.'
   
   `And what has come to thee?' replied the King, `and how art thou
   getting on with thy new and with thy old wife?' For Bahloul, not
   content with one wife, had married a second one.
   
   `I am not happy,' he answered, `neither with the old one, nor with the
   new one: and moreover poverty overpowers me.'
   
   The King said, `Can you recite any verses on this subject?'
   
   The buffoon having answered in the affirmative, Mamoum commanded him
   to recite those he knew, and Bahloul began as follows:
   
     Poverty holds me in chains; misery torments me:
     I am being scourged with all misfortunes;
     Ill luck has cast me in trouble and peril,
     And has drawn upon me the contempt of man.
     God does not favour a poverty like mine;
     That is opprobrious in every one's eyes.
     Misfortune and misery for a long time
     Have held me tightly; and no doubt of it
     My dwelling house will soon not know me more.
     
   Mamoum said to him, `Where are you going to?'
   
   He replied, `To God and his Prophet, O prince of the believers.'
   
   `That is well!' said the King; `those who take refuge in God and his
   Prophet and then in us, will be made welcome. But can you now tell me
   some more verses about your two wives, and about what comes to pass
   with them?'
   
   Certainly,' said Bahloul.
   
   `Then let us hear what you have to say!'
   
   Bahloul then began thus with poetical words:
   
     By reason of my ignorance I have married two wives -
     And why do you complain, O husband of two wives?
     I said to myself, I shall be like a lamb between them;
     I shall take my pleasure upon the bosoms of my two sheep,
     And I have become like a ram between two female jackals,
     Days follow upon days, and nights upon nights,
     And their yoke bears me down during both days and nights.
     If I am kind to one, the other gets vexed.
     And so I cannot escape from these two furies.
     If you want to live well and with a free heart,
     And with your hands unclenched, then do not marry.
     If you must wed, then marry one wife only:
     One alone is enough to satisfy two armies
     
   When Mamoum heard these words he began to laugh, till he nearly
   tumbled over. Then, as a proof of his kindness, he gave to Bahloul his
   golden robe, a most beautiful vestment.
   
   Bahloul went in high spirits towards the dwelling of the Grand Vizir.
   Just then Hamdonna looked from the height of her palace in that
   direction, and saw him. She said to her negress, `By the God of the
   temple of Mecca! There is Bahloul dressed in a fine gold-worked robe!
   How can I manage to get possession of the same?'
   
   The negress said, `Oh, my mistress, you would not know how to get hold
   of that robe.'
   
   Hamdonna answered, `I have thought of a trick whereby to achieve my
   ends, and I shall get the robe from him.' `Bahloul is a sly man,'
   replied the negress. `People think generally that they can make fun of
   him; but for God, it is he who really makes fun of them. Give up the
   idea, mistress mine, and take care that you do not fall into the snare
   which you intend setting for him.'
   
   But Hamdonna said again, `It must be done!' She then sent her negress
   to Bahloul, to tell him that he should come to her.
   
   He said, `By the blessing of God, to him who calls you, you shall make
   answer,' and went to Hamdonna.
   
   Hamdonna welcomed him and said: `Oh, Bahloul, I believe you come to
   hear me sing.' He replied: `Most certainly, oh, my mistress! You have
   a marvellous gift for singing.'
   
   `I also think that after having listened to my songs, you will be
   pleased to take some refreshments.'
   
   `Yes,' said he.
   
   Then she began to sing admirably, so as to make people who listened
   die with love.
   
   After Bahloul had heard her sing, refreshments were served; he ate,
   and he drank Then she said to him: `I do not know why, but I fancy you
   would gladly take off your robe, to make me a present of it.' And
   Bahloul answered: `Oh, my mistress! I have sworn to give it to her to
   whom I have done as a man does to a woman.'
   
   `Do you know what that is, Bahloul?' said she.
   
   `Do I know it?' replied he. `I, who am instructing God's creatures in
   that science? It is I who make them copulate in love, who initiate
   them in the delights a female can give, show them how one must caress
   a woman, and what will excite and satisfy her. Oh, my mistress, who
   should know the art of coition if it is not I?'
   
   Hamdonna was the daughter of Mamoum, and the wife of the Grand Vizir.
   She was endowed with the most perfect beauty; of a superb figure and
   harmonious form. No one in her time surpassed her in grace and
   perfection. Heroes on seeing her became humble and submissive, and
   looked down to the ground for fear of temptation, so many charms and
   perfections had God lavished on her. Those who looked steadily at her
   were troubled in their mind, and oh! how many heroes imperilled
   themselves for her sake. For this very reason Bahloul had always
   avoided meeting her for fear of succumbing to the temptation; and,
   apprehensive for his peace of mind, had never, until then, been in her
   presence.
   
   Bahloul began to converse with her. Now he looked at her and anon bent
   his eyes to the ground, fearful of not being able to command his
   passion. Hamdonna burnt with desire to have the robe, and he would not
   give it up without king paid for it.
   
   `What price do you demand,' she asked. To which he replied, `Coition,
   O apple of my eye.'
   
   `You know what that is, O Bahloul?' said she.
   
   `By God,' he cried; `no man knows women better than I; they are the
   occupation of my life. No one has studied all their concerns more than
   I. I know what they are fond of; for learn, oh, lady mine, that men
   choose different occupations according to their genius and their bent.
   The one takes, the other gives; this one sells, the other buys. My
   only thought is of love and of the possession of beautiful women. I
   heal those that are lovesick, and carry a solace to their thirsting
   vaginas.'
   
   Hamdonna was surprised at his words and the sweetness of his language.
   `Could you recite me some verses on this subject?' she asked.
   
   `Certainly,' he answered.
   
   `Very well, O Bahloul, let me hear what you have to say.' Bahloul
   recited as follows:
   
     Men are divided according to their affairs and doings;
     Some are always in spirits and joyful, others in tears.
     There are those whose life is restless and full of misery,
     While, on the contrary, others are steeped in good fortune,
     Always in luck's happy way, and favoured in all things.
     I alone am indifferent to all such matters.
     What care I for Turkomans, Persians, and Arabs?
     My whole ambition is in love and coition with women,
     No doubt nor mistake about that!
     If my member is without vulva, my state becomes frightful,
     My heart then burns with a fire which cannot be quenched.
     Look at my member erect! There it is - admire its beauty!
     It calms the heat of love and quenches the hottest fires
     By its movement in and out between your thighs.
     Oh, my hope and my apple, oh, noble and generous lady,
     If one time will not suffice to appease thy fire,
     I shall do it again, so as to give satisfaction;
     No one may reproach thee, for all the world does the same.
     But if you choose to deny me, then send me away!
     Chase me away from thy presence without any fear or remorse!
     Yet bethink thee, and speak and augment not my trouble,
     But, in the name of God, forgive me and do not reproach me.
     While I am here let thy words be kind and forgiving.
     Let them not fall upon me like sword-blades, keen and cuffing!
     Let me come to you and do not repel me.
     Let me come to you like one that brings drink to the thirsty;
     Hasten and let my hungry eyes look at thy bosom.
     Do not withhold from me love's joys, and do not be bashful,
     Give yourself up to me - I shall never cause you trouble,
     Even were you to fill me with sickness from head to foot.
     I shall always remain as I am, and you as you are,
     Knowing that I am the servant, and you are the mistress ever.
     Then shall our love be veiled? It shall be hidden for all time,
     For I keep it a secret and I shall be mute and muzzled.
     It is by God's will that everything happens,
     And he has filled me with love; but today my luck is ill.
     
   While Hamdonna was listening she nearly swooned, and set herself to
   examine the member of Bahloul, which stood erect like a column between
   his thighs. Now she said to herself: `I shall give myself up to him,'
   and now, `No I will not.' During this uncertainty she felt a yearning
   for pleasure deep within her parts privy; and Eblis made flow from her
   natural parts a moisture, the forerunner of pleasure. She then no
   longer combated her desire to cohabit with him, and reassured herself
   by the thought: `If this Bahloul, after having had his pleasure with
   me, should divulge it no one will believe his words.'
   
   She requested him to divest himself of his robe and to come into her
   room, but Bahloul replied: `I shall not undress till I have sated my
   desire, O apple of my eye.'
   
   Then Hamdonna rose, trembling with excitement for what was to follow;
   she undid her girdle, and left the room, Bahloul following her and
   thinking: `Am I really awake or is this a dream?' He walked after her
   till she had entered her boudoir. Then she threw herself on a couch of
   silk, which was rounded on the top like a vault, lifted her clothes up
   over her thighs, trembling all over, and all the beauty which God had
   given her was in Bahloul's arms.
   
   Bahloul examined the belly of Hamdonna, round like an elegant cupola'
   his eyes dwelt upon a navel which was like a pearl in a golden cup;
   and descending lower down there was a beautiful piece of nature's
   workmanship, and the whiteness and shape of her thighs surprised him.
   
   Then he pressed Hamdonna in a passionate embrace, and soon saw the
   animation leave her face; she seemed almost unconscious. She had lost
   her head; and holding Bahloul's member in her hands, excited and fired
   him more and more.
   
   Bahloul said to her: `Why do I see you so troubled and beside
   yourself?' And she answered: `Leave me, O son of a debauched woman! By
   God, I am like a mare in heat, and you continue to excite me still
   more with your words, and what words! They would set any woman on
   fire, if she was the purest creature in the world. You will insist in
   making me succumb by your talk and your verses.'
   
   Bahloul answered: `Am I then not like your husband?' `Yes,' she said,
   but a woman gets heat on account of the man, as a mare on account of
   the horse, whether the man be the husband or not; with this
   difference, however, that the mare gets lusty only at certain periods
   of the year, and only then receives the stallion, while a woman can
   always be made rampant by words of love. Both these dispositions have
   met within me, and, as my husband is absent, make haste, for he will
   soon be back'
   
   Bahloul replied. `Oh, my mistress, my loins hurt me and prevent me
   mounting upon you. You take the man's position, and then take my robe
   and let me depart.'
   
   Then he laid himself down in the position the woman takes in receiving
   a man; and his verge was standing up like a column.
   
   Hamdonna threw herself upon Bahloul, took his member between her hands
   and began to look at it. She was astonished at its size, strength and
   firmness, and cried: `Here we have the ruin of all women and the cause
   of many troubles. O Bahloul! I never saw a more beautiful dart than
   yours!' Still she continued keeping hold of it, and rubbed its bead
   against the lips of her vulva till the latter part seemed to say: `O
   member, come into me.'
   
   Then Bahloul inserted his member into the vagina of the Sultan's
   daughter, and she, settling down upon his engine, allowed it to
   penetrate entirely into her furnace till nothing more could be seen of
   it, not the slightest trace, and she said: `How lascivious has God
   made woman, and how indefatigable after her pleasures.' She then gave
   herself up to an up-and-down dance, moving her bottom like a riddle;
   to the right and left, and forward and backward; never was there such
   a dance as this.
   
   The Sultan's daughter continued her ride upon Bahloul's member till
   the moment of enjoyment arrived, and the attraction of the vulva
   seemed to pump the member as though by suction: just as an infant
   sucks the teat of the mother. The acme of enjoyment came to both
   simultaneously, and each took the pleasure with avidity.
   
   Then Hamdonna seized the member in order to withdraw it, and slowly,
   slowly she made it come out, saying: `This is the deed of a vigorous
   man.' Then she dried it and her own private parts with a silken
   kerchief and rose.
   
   Bahloul also got up and prepared to depart, but she said, `And the
   robe?'
   
   He answered, `Why, O mistress! You have been riding me, and still want
   a present?'
   
   `But,' said she, `did you not tell me that you could not mount me on
   account of the pains in your loins?'
   
   `It matters but little,' said Bahloul. `The first time it was your
   turn, the second will be mine, and the price for it will be the robe,
   and then I will go.'
   
   Hamdonna thought to herself, `As he began he may now go on; afterwards
   he will go away.'
   
   So she laid herself down, but Bahloul said, `I shall not lie with you
   unless you undress entirely.'
   
   Then she undressed until she was quite naked, and Bahloul fell into an
   ecstasy on seeing the beauty and perfection of her form. He looked at
   her magnificent thighs and rebounding navel, at her belly vaulted like
   an arch, her plump breasts standing out like hyacinths. Her neck was
   like a gazelle's, the opening of her mouth like a ring, her lips fresh
   and red like a gory sabre. Her teeth might have been taken for pearls
   and her cheeks for roses. Her eyes were black and well slit, and her
   eyebrows of ebony resembled the rounded flourish of the noun traced by
   the hand of a skilful writer. Her forehead was like the full moon in
   the night.
   
   Bahloul began to embrace her, to suck her lips and to kiss her bosom;
   he drew her fresh saliva and bit her thighs. So he went on till she
   was ready to swoon, and could scarcely stammer, and her eyes became
   veiled. Then he kissed her vulva, and she moved neither hand nor foot.
   He looked lovingly upon the secret parts of Hamdonna, beautiful enough
   to attract all eyes with their purple centre.
   
   Bahloul cried, `Oh, the temptation of man!' and still he bit her and
   kissed her till her desire was roused to its full pitch. Her sighs
   came quicker, and grasping his member with her hand she made it
   disappear in her vagina
   
   Then it was he who moved hard, and she who responded hotly, the
   overwhelming pleasure simultaneously calming their fervour.
   
   Then Bahloul got off her, dried his pestle and her mortar, and
   prepared to retire. But Hamdonna said, `Where is the robe? You mock
   me, O Bahloul.' He answered, `O my mistress, I shall only part with it
   for a consideration. You have had your dues and I mine. The first time
   was for you, the second time for me; now the third time shall be for
   the robe.'
   
   This said. he took it off, folded it, and put it in Hamdonna's hands,
   who, having risen, lay down again on the couch and said, `Do what you
   like!'
   
   Forthwith Bahloul threw himself upon her, and with one push completely
   buried his member in her vagina; then he began to work as with a
   pestle, and she to move her bottom, until both again did flow over at
   the same time. Then he rose from her side, left his robe, and went.
   
   The negress said to Hamdonna, `O my mistress, is it not as I have told
   you? Bahloul is a bad man, and you could not get the better of him.
   They consider him as a subject for mockery, but, before God, he is
   making fun of them. Why would you not believe me?'
   
   Hamdonna turned to her and said, `Do not tire me with your remarks. It
   came to pass what has to come to pass, and on the opening of each
   vulva is inscribed the name of the man who is to enter it, right or
   wrong, for love or for hatred. If Bahloul's name had not been
   inscribed on my vulva he would never have got into it, had he offered
   me the universe with all it contains.'
   
   As they were thus talking there came a knock at the door. The negress
   asked who was there, and in answer the voice of Bahloul said It is I.'
   Hamdonna, in doubt as to what the buffoon wanted to do, got
   frightened. The negress asked Bahloul what he wanted, and received the
   reply, `Bring me a little water.' She went out of the house with a cup
   full of water. Bahloul drank, and then let the cup slip out of his
   hands, and it was broken. The negress shut the door upon Bahloul, who
   sat himself down on the threshold.
   
   The buffoon being thus close to the door, the Vizir, Hamdonna's
   husband, arrived, who said to him, `Why do I see you here, O Bahloul?'
   And he answered, `O my lord, I was passing through the street when I
   was overcome by a great thirst. A negress came and brought me a cup of
   water. The cup slipped from my hands and got broken. Then our lady
   Hamdonna took my robe, which the Sultan our Master had given me, as
   indemnification.'
   
   Then said the Vizir, `Let him have his robe.' Hamdonna at this moment
   came out, and her husband asked her whether it was true that she had
   taken the robe in payment for the cup. Hamdonna then cried, beating
   her hands together, `What have you done, O Bahloul?' He answered, `I
   have talked to your husband the language of my folly; talk to him,
   you, the language of thy wisdom.' And she, enraptured with the cunning
   he had displayed, gave him back his robe, and he departed.

                                      
CHAPTER 2

  Concerning Women Who Deserve To Be Praised
  
   Know, O Vizir (and the mercy of God be with you!), that there are
   women of all sorts; that there are such as are worthy of praise, and
   such is deserve nothing but contempt.
   
   In order that a woman may be relished by men, she must have a perfect
   waist, and must be plump and lusty. Her hair will be black her
   forehead wide, she will have eyebrows of Ethiopian blackness, large
   black eyes, with the whites in them very limpid. With cheek of perfect
   oval, she will have an elegant nose and a graceful mouth; lips and
   tongue vermilion; her breath will be of pleasant odour, her throat
   long, her neck strong, her bust and her belly large; her breasts must
   be full and firm, her belly in good proportion, and her navel
   well-developed and marked; the lower part of the belly is to be large,
   the vulva projecting and fleshy, from the point where the hairs grow,
   to the buttocks; the conduit must be narrow and not moist, soft to the
   touch, and emitting a strong heat and no bad smell; she must have the
   thighs and buttocks hard, the hips large and full, a waist of fine
   shape, hands and feet of striking elegance, plump arms, and
   well-developed shoulders.
   
   If one looks at a woman with those qualities in front, one is
   fascinated; if from behind, one dies with pleasure. Looked at sitting,
   she is a rounded dome; lying, a soft-bed; standing, the staff of a
   standard. When she is walking, her natural parts appear as set off
   under her clothing. She speaks and laughs rarely, and never without a
   reason. She never leaves the house, even to see neighbours of her
   acquaintance. She has no women friends, gives her confidence to
   nobody, and her husband is her sole reliance. She takes nothing from
   anyone, excepting from her husband and her parents. If she sees
   relatives, she does not meddle with their affairs. She is not
   treacherous, and has no faults to hide, nor bad reasons to proffer.
   She does not try to entice people. If her husband shows his intention
   of performing the conjugal rite, she is agreeable to his desires and
   occasionally even provokes them. She assists him always in his
   affairs, and is sparing in complaints and tears; she does not laugh or
   rejoice when she sees her husband moody or sorrowful, but shares his
   troubles, and wheedles him into good humour, till he is quite content
   again. She does not surrender herself to anybody but her husband, even
   if abstinence would kill her. She hides her secret parts, and does not
   allow them to be seen; she is always elegantly attired, of the utmost
   personal propriety, and takes care not to let her husband see what
   might be repugnant to him. She perfumes herself with scents, uses
   antimony for her toilets, and cleans her teeth with souak.
   
   Such a woman is cherished by all men.
   
    The Story of the Negro Dorérame
    
   The story goes, and God knows its truth, that there was once a
   powerful King who had a large kingdom, armies and allies. His name was
   Ali ben Direme.
   
   One night, not being able to sleep at all, he called his Vizir, the
   Chief of the Police, and the Commander of his Guards. They presented
   themselves before him without delay, and he ordered them to arm
   themselves with their swords. They did so at once, and asked him,
   `What news is there?'
   
   He told them: `Sleep will not come to me; I wish to walk through the
   town tonight, and I must have you ready at my hand during my round.'
   
   `To hear is to obey,' they replied.
   
   The King then left, saying: `In the name of God! and may the blessing
   of the Prophet be with us, and benediction and mercy be with him.'
   
   His suite followed, and accompanied him everywhere from street to
   street.
   
   So they went on, until they heard a noise in one of the streets, and
   saw a man in the most violent passion stretched on the ground, face
   downwards, beating his breast with a stone and crying, `All there is
   no longer any justice here below! Is there nobody who will tell the
   King what is going on in his states?' And he repeated incessantly:
   `There is no longer any justice! she has disappeared and the whole
   world is in mourning.'
   
   The King said to his attendants, `Bring this man to me quietly, and be
   careful not to frighten him.' They went to him, took him by the hand,
   and said to him, `Rise and have no fear - no harm will come to you.'
   
   To which the man made answer, `You tell me that I shall not come to
   harm, and have nothing to be afraid of, and still you do not bid me
   welcome! And you know that the welcome of a believer is a warrant of
   security and forgiveness. Then, if the believer does not welcome the
   believer there is certainly ground for fear.' He then got up, and went
   with them towards the King.
   
   The King stood still, hiding his face with his haik, as also did his
   attendants. The latter had their swords in their hands, and leant upon
   them.
   
   When the man had come close to the King, he said, `Greetings be with
   you, O man!' The King answered, `I return your greetings, O man!' Then
   the man, `Why say you "O man?"' The King, `And why did you say "O
   man?"' `It is because I do not know your name.' `And likewise I do not
   know yours!'
   
   The King then asked him, `What mean these words I have heard: "Ah!
   there is no more justice here below! Nobody tells the King what is
   going on in his states!" Tell me what has happened to you.' `I shall
   tell it only to that man who can avenge me and free me from oppression
   and shame, if it so please Almighty God!'
   
   The King said to him, `May God place me at your disposal for your
   revenge and deliverance from oppression and shame!'
   
   `What I shall now tell you,' said the man, `is marvellous and
   surprising. I loved a woman, who loved me also, and we were united in
   love. These relations lasted a long while, until an old woman enticed
   my mistress and took her away to a house of misfortune, shame and
   debauchery. Then sleep fled from my couch; I have lost all my
   happiness, and I have fallen into the abyss of misfortune.'
   
   The King then said to him, `Which is that house of ill omen, and with
   whom is the woman?'
   
   The man replied, `She is with a negro of the name of Dorérame, who has
   at his house women beautiful as the moon, the likes of whom the King
   has not in his palace. He has a mistress who has a profound love for
   him, is entirely devoted to him, and who sends him all he wants in the
   way of silver, beverages and clothing.'
   
   Then the man stopped speaking. The King was much surprised at what he
   had heard, but the Vizir, who had not missed a word of this
   conversation, had certainly made out, from what the man had said, that
   the negro was no other than his own.
   
   The King requested the man to show him the house.
   
   `If I show it you, what will you do?' asked the man.
   
   `You will see what I shall do,' said the King. `You will not be able
   to do anything,' replied the man, `for it is a place which must be
   respected and feared. If you want to enter it by force you will risk
   death, for its master is redoubtable by means of his strength and
   courage.'
   
   `Show me the place,' said the King, `and have no fear.' The man
   answered, `So be it as God will!'
   
   He then rose, and walked before them. They followed him to a wide
   street, where he stopped in front of a house with lofty doors, the
   walls being on all sides high and inaccessible.
   
   They examined the walls, looking for a place where they might be
   scaled, but with no result. To their surprise they found the house to
   be as close as a breastplate.
   
   The King, turning to the man, asked him, `What is your name?'
   
   `Omar ben Isad,' he replied.
   
   The King said to him, `Omar, are you determined?'
   
   `Yes, my brother,' answered he, `if it so pleases God on high!' And
   turning to the King he added, `May God assist you tonight!'
   
   Then the King, addressing his attendants, said, `Are you determined?
   Is there one amongst you who could scale these walls?'
   
   `Impossible!' they all replied.
   
   Then said the King, `I myself will scale this wall, so please God on
   high! but by means of an expedient for which I require your
   assistance, and if you lend me the same I shall scale the wall, if it
   pleases God on high.'
   
   They said, `What is there to be done?'
   
   `Tell me,' said the King, `who is the strongest amongst you.' They
   replied, `The Chief of the Police, who is your Chaouch.'
   
   The King said, `And who next?'
   
   `The Commander of the Guards.'
   
   `And after him, who?' asked the King.
   
   `The Grand Vizir.'
   
   Omar listened with astonishment. He knew now that it was the King, and
   his joy was great.
   
   The King said, `Who is there yet?'
   
   Omar replied, `I, O my master.'
   
   The King said to him, `O Omar, you have found out who we are; but do
   not betray our disguise, and you will be absolved from blame.'
   
   `To hear is to obey,' said Omar.
   
   The King then said to the Chaouch, `Rest your hands against the wall
   so that your back projects.'
   
   The Chaouch did so.
   
   Then said the King to the Commander of the Guards, `Mount upon the
   back of the Chaouch.' He did so, and stood with his feet on the other
   man's shoulders. Then the King ordered the Vizir to mount, and he got
   on the shoulders of the Commander of the Guards, and put his hands
   against the wall.
   
   Then said the King, `O Omar, mount upon the highest place!' And Omar,
   surprised by this expedient, cried, `May God lend you his help, O our
   master, and assist you in your just enterprise!' He then got on to the
   shoulders of the Chaouch, and from there upon the back of the
   Commander of the Guards, and then upon that of the Vizir, and,
   standing upon the shoulders of the latter, he took the same position
   as the others. There was now only the King left.
   
   Then the King said, `In the name of God! and his blessing be with the
   prophet, upon whom be the mercy and salutation of God!' and, placing
   his hand upon the back of the Chaouch, he said, `Have a moment's
   patience; if I succeed you will be compensated!' He then did the same
   with the others, until he got upon Omar's back, to whom he also said,
   `O Omar, have a moment's patience with me, and I shall name you my
   private secretary. And, of all things, do not move!' Then, placing his
   feet upon Omar's shoulders, the King could with his hands grasp the
   terrace; and crying, `In the name of God! may he pour his blessings
   upon the Prophet, on whom be the mercy and salutation of God!' he made
   a spring, and stood upon the terrace.
   
   Then he said to his attendants, `Descend now from each other's
   shoulders!'
   
   And they got down one after another, and they could not help admiring
   the ingenious idea of the King, as well as the strength of the Chaouch
   who carried four men at once.
   
   The King then began to look for a place for descending, but found no
   passage. He unrolled his turban, fixed one end with a single knot at
   the place where he was, and let himself down into the courtyard, which
   he explored until he found the portal in the middle of the house
   fastened with an enormous lock. The solidity of this lock, and the
   obstacle it created, gave him a disagreeable surprise. He said to
   himself, `I am now in difficulty, but all comes from God; it was he
   who gave me the strength and the idea that brought me here; he will
   also provide the means for me to return to my companions.'
   
   He then set himself to examine the place where he found himself, and
   counted the chambers one after another. He found seventeen chambers or
   rooms, furnished in different styles, with tapestries and velvet
   hangings of various colours, from the first to the last.
   
   Examining all round, he saw a place raised by seven stairsteps, from
   which issued a great noise from voices. He went up to it, saying, `O
   God! favour my project, and let me come safe and sound out of here.
   
   He mounted the first step, saying, `In the name of God the
   compassionate and merciful!' Then he began to look at the steps, which
   were of variously coloured marble - black, red, white, yellow, green
   and other shades.
   
   Mounting the second step, he said, `He whom God helps is invincible!'
   
   On the third step he said, `With the aid of God the victory is near.'
   
   And on the fourth, `I have asked victory of God, who is the most
   puissant auxiliary.'
   
   Finally he mounted the fifth, sixth, and seventh steps, invoking the
   prophet (with whom be the mercy and salvation of God).
   
   He then arrived at the curtain hanging at the entrance; it was of red
   brocade. From there he examined the room, which was bathed in light,
   filled with many chandeliers, and candles burning in golden sconces.
   In the middle of this saloon played a jet of musk-water. A tablecloth
   extended from end to end, covered with sundry meats and fruits.
   
   The saloon was provided with gilt furniture, the splendour of which
   dazzled the eye. In fact, everywhere, there were ornaments of all
   kinds.
   
   On looking closer the King ascertained that round the tablecloth there
   were twelve maidens and seven women, all like moons; he was astonished
   at their beauty and grace. There were likewise with them seven negroes
   and this sight filled him with surprise. His attention was above all
   attracted by a woman like the full moon, of perfect beauty, with black
   eyes, oval cheeks, and a lithe and graceful waist; she humbled the
   hearts of those who became enamoured of her.
   
   Stupefied by her beauty, the King was as one stunned. He then said to
   himself `How is there any getting out of this place? O my spirit, do
   not give way to love!'
   
   And continuing his inspection of the room, he perceived in the hands
   of those who were present, glasses filled with wine. They were
   drinking and eating, and it was easy to see they were overcome with
   drink.
   
   While the King was pondering how to escape his embarrassment, he heard
   one of the women saying to one of her companions, calling her by name,
   `Oh, so and so, rise and light a torch, so that we two can go to bed,
   for sleep is overpowering us. Come, light the torch, and let us retire
   to the other chamber.'
   
   They rose and lifted up the curtain to leave the room. The King hid
   himself to let them pass; then, perceiving that they had left their
   chamber to do a thing necessary and obligatory in human kind, he took
   advantage of their absence, entered their apartment, and hid himself
   in a cupboard.
   
   Whilst he was thus in hiding the women returned and shut the doors.
   Their reason was obscured by the fumes of wine; they pulled off all
   their clothes and began to caress each other mutually.
   
   The King said to himself, `Omar has told me true about this house of
   misfortune as an abyss of debauchery.'
   
   When the women had fallen asleep the King rose, extinguished the
   light, undressed, and lay down between the two. He had taken care
   during their conversation to impress their names on his memory. So he
   was able to say to one of them, `You, so and so, where have you put
   the door-keys?' speaking very low.
   
   The woman answered, `Go to sleep, you whore, the keys are in their
   usual place.'
   
   The King said to himself, `There is no might and strength but in God
   the Almighty and Benevolent!' and was much troubled.
   
   And again he asked the woman about the keys, saying, `Daylight is
   coming. I must open the doors. There is the sun. I am going to open
   the house.'
   
   And she answered, `The keys are in the usual place. Why do you thus
   bother me? Sleep, I say, till it is day.'
   
   And again the King said to himself, `There is no might and strength
   but in God the Almighty and Benevolent, and surely if it were not for
   the fear of God I should run my sword through her.' Then he began
   again, `Oh, you, so and so!'
   
   She said, `What do you want?'
   
   `I am uneasy,' said the King, `about the keys; tell me where they
   are.'
   
   And she answered, `You hussy! Does your vulva itch for coition? Cannot
   you do without for a single night? Look! the Vizir's wife has
   withstood all the entreaties of the negro, and repelled him since six
   months! Go the keys are in the negro's pocket. Do not say to him,
   "Give me the keys;" but say, "Give me your member." You know his name
   is Dorérame.'
   
   The King was now silent, for he knew what to do. He waited a short
   time till the woman was asleep; then he dressed himself in her
   clothes, and concealed his sword under them; his face he hid under a
   veil of red silk. Thus dressed he looked like other women. Then he
   opened the door, stole softly out, and placed himself behind the
   curtains of the saloon entrance. He saw only some people sitting
   there; the remainder were asleep.
   
   The King made the following silent prayer, `O my soul, let me follow
   the right way, and let all those people among whom I find myself be
   stunned with drunkenness, so that they cannot know the King from his
   subjects, and God give me strength.'
   
   He then entered the saloon saying: `In the name of God!' and he
   tottered towards the bed of the negro as if drunk. The negroes and the
   women took him to be the woman whose attire he had taken.
   
   Dorérame had a great desire to have his pleasure with that woman, and
   when he saw her sit down by the bed he thought that she had broken her
   sleep to come to him, perhaps for love games. So he said, `Oh, you, so
   and so, undress and get into my bed, I shall soon be back'
   
   The King said to himself, `There is no might and strength but in the
   High God, the Benevolent!' Then he searched for the keys in the
   clothes and pockets of the negro, but found nothing. He said, `God's
   will be done!' Then raising his eyes, he saw a high window; he reached
   up with his arm, and found gold-embroidered garments there; he slipped
   his hands into the pockets, and, oh, surprise! he found the keys. He
   examined then' and counted seven, corresponding to the number of the
   doors of the house, and in his joy, he exclaimed, `God, be praised and
   glorified!' Then he said, `I can only get out of here by a ruse.' Then
   feigning sickness, and appearing as if he wanted to vomit violently,
   he held his hand before his mouth, and hurried to the centre of the
   courtyard. The negro said to him, `God bless you! oh, so and so! any
   other woman would have been sick into the bed!'
   
   `The King then went to the inner door of the house, and opened it; he
   closed it behind him, and so from one door to the other, till he came
   to the seventh, which opened upon the street. Here he found his
   companions agaIn, who had been in great anxiety, and who asked him
   what he had seen?
   
   Then said the King: `This is not the time to answer. Let us go into
   this house with the blessing of God and with his help.'
   
   They resolved to be upon their guard, there being in the house seven
   negroes twelve maidens, and seven women, beautiful as moons.
   
   The Vizir asked the King, `What garments are these?' And the King
   answered, `Be silent; without them I should never have got the keys.'
   
   He then went to the chamber where were the two women, with whom he had
   been lying, took off the clothes in which he was dressed, and resumed
   his own, taking good care of his sword. Repairing to the saloon, where
   the negroes and the women were, he and his companions ranged
   themselves behind the door curtain.
   
   After having looked into the saloon, they said, `Amongst all these
   women there is none more beautiful than the one seated on the elevated
   cushion!' The King said, `I reserve her for myself, if she does not
   belong to someone else.'
   
   While they were examining the interior of the saloon, Dorérame
   descended from the bed, and after him one of those beautiful women.
   Then another negro got on the bed with another woman, and soon till
   the seventh. They rode them in this way, one after the other,
   excepting the beautiful woman mentioned above, and the maidens. Each
   of these women appeared to mount upon the bed with marked reluctance,
   and descended, after the coition was finished, with her head bent
   down.
   
   The negroes, however, were lusting after, and pressing one after the
   other, the beautiful woman. But she spurned them all, saying, `I shall
   never consent to it, and as to these virgins, I take them also under
   my protection.'
   
   Dorérame then rose and went up to her, holding in his hands his member
   in full erection, stiff as a pillar. He hit her with it on the face
   and head, saying, `Six times this night I have pressed you to cede to
   my desires, and you always refuse; but now I must have you, even this
   night.'
   
   When the woman saw the stubbornness of the negro and the state of
   drunkenness he was in, she tried to soften him by promises. `Sit down
   here by me,' she said, `and tonight thy desires shall be contented.'
   
   The negro sat down near her with his member still erect as a column.
   The King could scarcely master his surprise.
   
   Then the woman began to sing the following verses, intoning them from
   the bottom of her heart:
   
     I prefer a young man for coition, and him only;
     He is full of courage - he is my sole ambition,
     His member is strong to deflower the virgin,
     And richly proportioned in all its dimensions;
     It has a head like to a brazier.
     Enormous, and none like it in creation;
     Strong it is and hard, with the head rounded off.
     It is always ready for action and does not die down;
     It never sleeps, owing to the violence of its love.
     It sighs to enter my vulva, and sheds tears on my belly;
     It asks not fur help, not being in want of any;
     It has no need of an ally, and stands alone the greatest fatigues,
     And nobody can be sure of what will result from its efforts.
     Full of vigour and life, it bores into my vagina,
     And it works about there in action constant and splendid.
     First from the front to the back, and then from the right to the
     left;
     Now it is crammed hard in by vigorous pressure,
     Now it rubs its head on the orifice of my vagina.
     And he strokes my back, my stomach, my sides,
     Kisses my cheeks, and anon begins to suck at my lips.
     He embraces me close, and makes me roll on the bed,
     And between his arms I am like a corpse without life.
     Every part of my body receives in turn his love-bites,
     And he covers me with kisses of fire;
     When he sees me in heat he quickly comes to me,
     Then he opens my thighs and kisses my belly,
     And puts his tool in my hand to make it knock at my door.
     Soon he is in the cave, and I feel pleasure approaching.
     He shakes me and trills me, and hotly we both are working,
     And he says, `Receive my seed!' and I answer, `Oh give it beloved
     one!
     It shall be welcome to me, you light of my eyes!
     Oh, you man of all men, who fillest me with pleasure.
     Oh, you soul of my soul, go on with fresh vigour,
     For you must not yet withdraw it from me; leave it there,
     And this day will then be free of all sorrow.
     He had sworn to God to have me for seventy nights,
     And what he wished for he did, in the way of kisses and embraces,
     during all those nights.
     
   When she had finished, the King, in great surprise, said, `How
   lascivious has God made this woman.' And turning to his companions,
   `There is no doubt that this woman has no husband, and has not been
   debauched, for, certainly that negro is in love with her, and she has
   nevertheless repulsed him.'
   
   Omar ben Isad took the word, `This is true, O King! Her husband has
   been now away for nearly a year, and many men have endeavoured to
   debauch her, but she has resisted.'
   
   The King asked, `Who is her husband?' And his companions answered,
   `She is the wife of the son of your father's Vizir.'
   
   The King replied, `You speak true; I have indeed heard it said that
   the son of my father's Vizir had a wife without fault, endowed with
   beauty and perfection and of exquisite shape; not adulterous and
   innocent of debauchery.'
   
   `This is the same woman,' said they.
   
   The King said, `No matter how, but I must have her,' and turning to
   Omar, he added, `Where, amongst these women, is your mistress?' Omar
   answered, `I do not see her, O King!' upon which the King said, `Have
   patience, I will show her to you.' Omar was quite surprised to find
   that the King knew so much. `And this then is the negro Dorérame?'
   asked the King. `Yes, and he is a slave of mine,' answered the Vizir.
   `Be silent, this is not the time to speak,' said the King.
   
   While this of course was going on, the negro Dorérame, still desirous
   of obtaining the favours of that lady, said to her, `I am tired of
   your lies, O Beder el Bedour' (full moon of the full moons), for so
   she called herself.
   
   The King said, `He who called her so called her by her true name, for
   she is the fall moon of the full moons, afore God!'
   
   However, the negro wanted to draw the woman away with him, and hit her
   in the face.
   
   The King, mad with jealousy, and with his heart full of ire, said to
   the Vizir, `Look what your negro is doing! By God! he shall die the
   death of a villain, and I shall make an example of him, and a warning
   to those who would imitate him!'
   
   At that moment the King heard the lady say to the negro, `You are
   betraying your master the Vizir with his wife, and now you betray her,
   in spite of your intimacy with her and the favours she grants to you.
   And surely she loves you passionately, and you are pursuing another
   woman!'
   
   The King said to the Vizir, `Listen, and do not speak a word.' The
   lady then rose and returned to the place where she had been before,
   and began to recite:
   
     Oh, men! listen to what I say on the subject of woman,
     Her thirst for coition is written between her eyes.
     Do not put trust in her vows, even were she the Sultan's daughter.
     Woman's malice is boundless; not even the king of kings
     Would suffice to subdue it, whate'er be his might.
     Men, take heed and shun the love of woman!
     Do not say, `Such a one is my well beloved';
     Do not say, `She is my life's companion.'
     If I deceive you, then say my words are untruths.
     As long as she is with you in bed, you have her love,
     But a woman's love is not enduring, believe me.
     Lying upon her breast, you are her love-treasure;
     Whilst the coition goes on, you have her love, poor fool!
     But, anon, she looks upon you as a fiend;
     And this is a fact undoubted and certain.
     The wife receives the slave in the bed of the master,
     And the serving-men allay upon her their lust
     Certain it is, such conduct is not to be praised and honoured.
     But the virtue of women is frail and changeful,
     And the man thus deceived is looked upon with contempt.
     Therefore a man with a heart should not put trust in a woman.
     
   At these words the Vizir began to cry, but the King bade him to be
   quiet. Then the negro recited the following verses in response to
   those of the lady:
   
     We negroes have had our fill of women,
     We fear not their tricks, however subtle they be.
     Men confide in us with regard to what they cherish.
     This is no lie, remember, but is the truth, as you know.
     Oh, you women all! for sure you have no patience when the virile
     member you are wanting,
     For in the same resides your life and death;
     It is the end and all of your wishes, secret or open.
     If your choler and ire are aroused against your husbands,
     They appease you simply by introducing their members.
     Your religion resides in your vulva, and the manly member is your
     soul.
     Such you will always find is the nature of woman.
     
   With that, the negro threw himself upon the woman, who pushed him
   back.
   
   At this moment, the King felt his heart oppressed; he drew his sword,
   as did his companions, and they entered the room. The negroes and
   women saw nothing but brandished swords.
   
   One of the negroes rose, and rushed upon the King and his companions,
   but the Chaouch severed with one blow his head from his body. The King
   cried, `God's blessing upon you! Your arm is not withered and your
   mother has not borne a weakling. You have struck down your enemies,
   and paradise shall be your dwelling and place of rest!'
   
   Another negro got up and aimed a blow at the Chaouch, which broke the
   sword of the Chaouch in twain. It had been a beautiful weapon, and the
   Chaouch, on seeing it ruined, broke out into the most violent passion;
   he seized the negro by the arm, lifted him up, and threw him against
   the wall, breaking his bones. Then the King cried, `God is great. He
   has not dried up your hand. Oh, what a Chaouch! God grant you his
   blessing.'
   
   `The negroes, when they saw this, were cowed and silent, and the King,
   master now of their lives, said, `The man that lifts his hand only,
   shall lose his head!' And he commanded that the remaining five negroes
   should have their hands tied behind their backs.
   
   This having been done, he turned to Beder el Bedour and asked her,
   `Whose wife are you, and who is this negro?'
   
   She then told him on that subject what he had heard already from Omar.
   And the King thanked her, saying, `May God give you his blessing.' He
   then asked her, `How long can a woman patiently do without coition?'
   She seemed amazed, but the King said, `Speak, and do not be abashed.'
   
   She then answered, `A well-born lady of high origin can remain for six
   months without; but a lowly woman of no race nor high blood, who does
   not respect herself when she can lay her hand upon a man, will have
   him upon her; his stomach and his member will know her vagina.'
   
   Then said the King, pointing to one of the women, `Who is this one?'
   She answered, `This is the wife of the Cadi.' `And this one?' `The
   wife of the second Vizir.' `And this?' `The wife of the Chief of the
   Muftis.' `And that one?' `The Treasurer's.' `And those two women that
   are in the other room?' She answered, `They have received the
   hospitality of the house, and one of them was brought here yesterday
   by an old woman; the negro has so far not got possession of her.'
   
   Then said Omar, `This is the one I spoke to you about, O my master.'
   
   `And the other woman? To whom does she belong?' said the King.
   
   `She is the wife of the Amine of the Carpenters,' answered she.
   
   Then said the King, `And these girls, who are they?'
   
   She answered, `This one is the daughter of the clerk of the treasury;
   this other one the daughter of the Mohtesib, the third is the daughter
   of the Bouab, the next one the daughter of the Athine of the Moueddin;
   that one the daughter of the colour-keeper.' At the invitation of the
   King, she passed them thus all in review.
   
   The King then asked for the reason of so many women being brought
   together there.
   
   Beder el Bedour replied, `O master of ours, the negro knows no other
   passions than for coition and good wine. He keeps making love night
   and day, and his member rests only when he himself is asleep.
   
   The King asked further, `What does he live upon?'
   
   She said, `Upon yolks of eggs fried in fat and swimming in honey, and
   upon white bread; he drinks nothing but old muscatel wine.'
   
   The King said, `Who has brought these women here, who, all of them,
   belong to officials of the State?'
   
   She replied `O master of ours, he has in his service an old woman who
   has had the run of the houses in the town; she chooses and brings to
   him any woman of superior beauty and perfection; but she serves him
   only against good consideration in silver, dresses, etc., precious
   stones, rubies, and other objects of value.'
   
   `And whence does the negro get that silver?' asked the King. The lady
   remaining silent, he added, `Give me some information, please.'
   
   She signified with a sign from the corner of her eye that he had got
   it all from the wife of the Grand Vizir.
   
   The King understood her, and continued, `O Beder el Bedour! I have
   faith and confidence in you, and your testimony will have in my eyes
   the value of that of the two Adels. Speak to me without reserve as to
   what concerns yourself.'
   
   She answered him, `I have not been touched, and however long this
   might have lasted the negro would not have had his desire satisfied.'
   
   `Is this so?' asked the King.
   
   She replied `It is so!' She had understood what the King wanted to
   say, and the King had seized the meaning of her words.
   
   `Has the negro respected my honour? Inform me about that,' said the
   King.
   
   She answered, `He has respected your honour as far as your wives are
   concerned. He has not pushed his criminal deeds that far; but if God
   had spared his days there is no certainty that he would not have tried
   to soil what he should have respected.'
   
   The King having asked her then who those negroes were, she answered,
   `They are his companions. Alter he had quite surfeited himself with
   the women he had caused to be brought to him, he handed them over to
   them, as you have seen. If it were not for the protection of a woman,
   where would that man be?'
   
   Then spoke the King, `O Beder el Bedour, why did not your husband ask
   my help against this oppression? Why did you not complain?'
   
   She replied, `O King of the time, O beloved Sultan, O master of
   numerous armies and allies! As regards my husband I was so far unable
   to inform him of my lot; as to myself I have nothing to say but what
   you know by the verses I sang just now. I have given advice to men
   about women from the first verse to the last.'
   
   The King said, `O Beder el Bedour! I like you, I have put the question
   to you in the name of the chosen Prophet (the benediction and mercy of
   God be with him!). Inform me of everything; you have nothing to fear;
   I give you the aman complete. Has this negro not enjoyed you? For I
   presume that none of you were out of reach of his attempts and had her
   honour safe.'
   
   She replied, `O King of our time, in the name of your high rank and
   your power! Look! He, about whom you ask me, I would not have accepted
   him as a legitimate husband; how could I have consented to grant him
   the favour of an illicit love?'
   
   The King said, `You appear to be sincere, but the verses I heard you
   sing have roused doubts in my soul.'
   
   She replied, `I had three motives for employing that language.
   Firstly, I was at that moment in heat, like a young mare; secondly,
   Eblis had excited my natural parts; and lastly, I wanted to quiet the
   negro and make him have patience, so that he should grant me some
   delay and leave me in peace until God would deliver me of him.'
   
   The King said, `Do you speak seriously?' She was silent. Then the King
   cried, `O Beder el Bedour, you alone shall be pardoned!' She
   understood that it was she only that the King would spare from the
   punishment of death. He then cautioned her that she must keep the
   secret, and said he wanted to leave now.
   
   Then all the women and virgins approached Beder el Bedour and implored
   her, saying, `Intercede for us, for you have power over the King'; and
   they shed tears over her hands, and in despair threw themselves down.
   
   Beder el Bedour then called the King back, as he was going, and said
   to him, `O our master! you have not granted me any favour yet. `How,'
   said he, `I have sent for a beautiful mule for you; you will mount her
   and come with us. As for these women, they must all of them die.'
   
   She then said, `O our master! I ask you and conjure you to authorise
   me to make a stipulation which you will accept.' The King made oath
   that he would fulfil it. Then she said, `I ask as a gift the pardon of
   all these women and of all these maidens. Their deaths would moreover
   throw the most terrible consternation over the whole town.'
   
   The King said, `There is no might nor power but in God, the merciful!'
   He then ordered the negroes to be taken out and beheaded. The only
   exception he made was with the negro Dorérame, who was enormously
   stout and had a neck like a bull. They cut off his ears, nose, and
   lips; likewise his virile member, which they put into his mouth, and
   then hung him on a gallows.
   
   Then the King ordered the seven doors of the house to be closed, and
   returned to his palace.
   
   At sunrise he sent a mule to Beder el Bedour, in order to let her be
   brought to him. He made her dwell with him, and found her to be
   excelling all those who excel.
   
   `Then the King caused the wife of Omar ben Isad to be restored to him,
   and he made him his private secretary. After which he ordered the
   Vizir to repudiate his wife. He did not forget the Chaouch and the
   Commander of the Guards, to whom he made large presents, as he had
   promised, using for that purpose the negro's hoards. He sent the son
   of his father's Vizir to prison. He also caused the old go-between to
   be brought before him, and asked her, `Give me all the particulars
   about the conduct of the negro, and tell me whether it was well done
   to bring in that way women to men.' She answered, `This is the trade
   of nearly all old women.' He then had her executed, as well as all old
   women who followed that trade, and thus cut off in his State the tree
   of panderism at the root, and burnt the trunk.
   
   He besides sent back to their families all the women and girls, and
   bade them repent in the name of God.
   
   This story presents but a small part of the tricks and stratagems used
   by women against their husbands.
   
   The moral of the tale is, that a man who falls in love with a woman
   imperils himself, and exposes himself to the greatest troubles.

                                      
CHAPTER 3

  About Men Who Are To Be Held in Contempt
  
   Know, O My Brother (to whom God be merciful), that a man who is
   misshapen, of coarse appearance, and whose member is short, thin and
   flabby, is contemptible in the eyes of women.
   
   When such a man has a bout with a woman, he does not do his business
   with vigour and in a manner to give her enjoyment. He lays himself
   down upon her without previous toying, he does not kiss her, nor twine
   himself round her; he does not bite her, nor suck her lips, nor tickle
   her.
   
   He gets upon her before she has begun to long for pleasure, and then
   he introduces with infinite trouble a member soft and nerveless.
   Scarcely has he commenced when he is already done for; he makes one or
   two movements, and then sinks upon the woman's breast to spend his
   sperm; and that is the most he can do. This done he withdraws his
   affair, and makes all haste to get down again from her.
   
   Such a man - as was said by a writer - is quick in ejaculation and
   slow as to erection; after the trembling, which follows the
   ejaculation of the seed, his chest is heavy and his sides ache.
   
   Qualities like these are no recommendation with women. Despicable also
   is the man who is false in his words; who does not fulfil the promise
   he has made; who never speaks without telling lies, and who conceals
   from his wife all his doings, except the adulterous exploits which he
   commits.
   
   Women cannot esteem such men, as they cannot procure them any
   enjoyment.
   
   It is said that a man of the name of Abbes, whose member was extremely
   small and slight, had a very corpulent wife, whom he could not
   contrive to satisfy in coition, so that she soon began to complain to
   her female friends about it.
   
   This woman possessed a considerable fortune, whilst Abbes was very
   poor and when he wanted anything, she was sure not to let him have
   what he wanted.
   
   One day he went to see a wise man, and submitted his case to him.
   
   The sage told him: `If you had a fine member you might dispose of her
   fortune. Do you not know that women's religion is in their vulvas? But
   I will prescribe you a remedy which will do away with your troubles.'
   
   Abbes lost no time in making up the remedy according to the recipe of
   the wise man, and after he had used it his member grew to be long and
   thick. When his wife saw it in that state she was surprised; but it
   was still better when he made her feel in the matter of enjoyment
   quite another thing than she had been accustomed to experience; he
   began in fact to work her with his tool in quite a remarkable manner,
   to such a point that she trembled and sighed and sobbed and cried out
   during the operation.
   
   As soon as the wife found in her husband such eminently good qualities
   she gave him her fortune, and placed her person and all she had at his
   disposal.

                                      
CHAPTER 4

  About Women Who Are To Be Held in Contempt
  
   Know, O Vizir (to whom God be merciful), that women differ in their
   natural dispositions: there are women who are worthy of all praise;
   and there are, on the other hand, women who only merit contempt.
   
   The woman who merits the contempt of men is ugly and garrulous; her
   hair is woolly, her forehead projecting, her eyes are small and blear,
   her nose is enormous, the lips lead-coloured, the mouth large, the
   cheeks wrinkled and she shows gaps in her teeth; her cheekbones shine
   purple, and she sports bristles on her chin; her head sits on a meagre
   neck, with very much developed tendons; her shoulders are contracted
   and her chest is narrow, with flabby pendulous breasts, and her belly
   is like an empty leather-bottle, with the navel standing out like a
   heap of stones; her flanks are shaped like arcades; the bones of her
   spinal column may be counted; there is no flesh upon her croup; her
   vulva is large and cold.
   
   Finally, such a woman has large knees and feet, big hands and
   emaciated legs.
   
   A woman with such blemishes can give no pleasure to men in general,
   and least of all to him who is her husband or who enjoys her favours.
   
   The man who approaches a woman like that with his member in erection
   will find it presently soft and relaxed, as though he was only close
   to a beast of burden. May God keep us from a woman of that
   description!
   
   Contemptible likewise is the woman who is constantly laughing out;
   for, as it was said by an author, `If you see a woman who is always
   laughing, fond of gaming and jesting, always ruling to her neighbours,
   meddling with matters that are no concern of hers, plaguing her
   husband with constant complaints, leaguing herself with other women
   against him, playing the grand lady, accepting gifts from everybody,
   know that that woman is a whore without shame.'
   
   And again to be despised is the woman of a sombre, frowning nature,
   and one who is prolific in talk; the woman who is light-headed in her
   relations with men, or contentious, or fond of tittle-tattle and
   unable to keep her husband's secrets, or who is malicious. The woman
   of a malicious nature talks only to tell lies; if she makes a promise
   she does so only to break it, and if anybody confides in her, she
   betrays him; she is debauched, thievish, a scold, coarse and violent;
   she cannot give good advice; she is always occupied with the affairs
   of other people, and with such as bring harm, and is always on the
   watch for frivolous news; she is fond of repose, but not of work; she
   uses unbecoming words in addressing a Mussulman, even to her husband;
   invectives are always at her tongue's end; she exhales a bad odour
   which infects you, and sticks to you even after you have left her.
   
   And not less contemptible is she who talks to no purpose, who is a
   hypocrite and does no good act; she, who, when her husband asks her to
   fulfil the conjugal office, refuses to listen to his demand; the woman
   who does not assist her husband in his affairs; and finally, she who
   fatigues him with unceasing complaints and tears.
   
   A woman of that sort, seeing her husband irritated or in trouble does
   not share his affliction; on the contrary, she laughs and jests all
   the more, and does not try to drive away his ill-humour by
   endearments. She is more prodigal with her person to other men than to
   her husband; it is not for his sake that she adorns herself, and it is
   not to please him that she tries to look well. Far from that; with him
   she is very untidy, and does not mind letting him see things and
   habits about her person which must be repugnant to him. Lastly, she
   never uses either atsmed nor souak.
   
   No happiness can be hoped for a man with such a wife. God keep us from
   such a one!

                                      
CHAPTER 5

  Relating to the Act of Generation
  
   Know, O Vizir (and God protect you!), that if you wish for coition, in
   joining the woman you should not have your stomach loaded with food
   and drink, only in that condition will your cohabitation be wholesome
   and good. If your stomach is full, only harm can come of it to both of
   you; you will have threatening symptoms of apoplexy and gout, and the
   least evil that may result from it will be the inability of passing
   your urine, or weakness of sight.
   
   Let your stomach then be free from excessive food and drink, and you
   need not apprehend any illness.
   
   Before setting to work with your wife excite her with toying, so that
   the copulation will finish to your mutual satisfaction.
   
   Thus it will be well to play with her before you introduce your verge
   and accomplish the cohabitation. You will excite her by kissing her
   cheeks, sucking her lips and nibbling at her breasts. You will lavish
   kisses on her navel and thighs, and titillate the lower parts. Bite at
   her arms, and neglect no part of her body; cling close to her bosom,
   and show her your love and submission. Interlace your legs with hers,
   and press her in your arms, for, as the poet has said:
   
     Under her neck my right hand
     Has served her for a cushion,
     And to draw her to me
     I have sent out my left hand,
     Which bore her up as a bed.
     
     When you are close to a woman, and you see her eyes getting dim,
     and hear her, yearning for coition, heave deep sighs, then let your
     and her yearning be joined into one, and let your lubricity rise to
     the highest point; for this will be the moment most favourable to
     the game of love. The pleasure which the woman then feels will be
     extreme; as for yourself, you will cherish her all the more, and
     she will continue her affection for you, for it has been said:
     
     If you see a woman heaving deep sighs, with her lips getting red
     and her eyes languishing, when her mouth half opens and her
     movements grow heedless; when she appears to be disposed to go to
     sleep, vacillating in her steps and prone to yawn, know that this
     is the moment for coition; and if you there and then make your way
     into her you will procure for her an unquestionable treat. You
     yourself will find the mouth of her womb clasping your article,
     which is undoubtedly the crowning pleasure for both, for this
     before everything begets affection and love.
     
     The following precepts, coming from a profound connoisseur in love
     affairs, are well known:
     
     Woman is like a fruit, which will not yield its sweetness until you
     rub it between your hands. Look at the basil plant; if you do not
     rub it warm with your fingers it will not emit any scent. Do you
     not know that the amber, unless it be handled and warmed, keeps
     hidden within its pores the aroma contained in it. It is the same
     with woman. If you do not animate her with your toying, intermixed
     with Kissing, nibbling and touching, you will not obtain from her
     what you are wishing; you will feel no enjoyment when you share her
     couch, and you will waken in her heart neither inclination nor
     affection, nor love for you; all her qualities will remain hidden.
     
     It is reported that a man, having asked a woman what means were the
     most likely to create affection in the female heart, with respect
     to the pleasures of coition, received the following answer:
     
     O you who question me, those things which develop the taste for
     coition are the toyings and touches which precede it, and then the
     close embrace at the moment of ejaculation!
     
     Believe me, the kisses, nibblings, suction of the lips, the close
     embrace, the visits of the mouth to the nipples of the bosom, and
     the sipping of the fresh saliva, these are the things to render
     affection lasting.
     
     In acting thus, the two orgasms take place simultaneously, and
     enjoyment comes to the man and woman at the same moment. Then the
     man feels the womb grasping his member, which gives to each of them
     the most exquisite pleasure.
     
     This it is which gives birth to love, and if matters have not been
     managed this way the woman has not had her full share of pleasure,
     and the delights of the womb are wanting. Know that the woman will
     not feel her desires satisfied, and will not love her rider unless
     he is able to act up to her womb; but when the womb is made to
     enter into action she will feel the most violent love for her
     cavalier, even if he be unsightly in appearance.
     
     Then do all you can to provoke a simultaneous discharge of the two
     spermal fluids; herein lies the secret of love.
     
     One of the savants who have occupied themselves with this subject
     has thus related the confidences which one of them made to him:
     
     O you men, one and all, who are soliciting the love of woman and
     her affection, and who wish that sentiment in her heart to be of an
     enduring nature, toy with her previous to coition; prepare her for
     enjoyment, and neglect nothing to attain that end. Explore her with
     the greater assiduity, and, entirely occupied with her, let nothing
     else engage your thoughts. Do not let the moment propitious for
     pleasure pass away; that moment will be when you see her eyes
     humid, half open. Then go to work, but, remember, not till your
     kisses and toyings have taken effect.
     
     After you have got the woman into a proper state of excitement, O
     men! put your member into her, and, if you then observe the proper
     movements, she will experience a pleasure which will satisfy all
     her desires.
     
     Lie on her breast, rain kisses on her cheeks, and let not your
     member quit her vagina. Push for the mouth of her womb. This will
     crown your labour.
     
     If, by God's favour, you have found this delight, take good care
     not to withdraw your member, but let it remain there, and imbibe an
     endless pleasure! Listen to the sighs and heavy breathing of the
     woman. They witness the violence of the bliss you have given her.
     
     And after the enjoyment is over, and your amorous struggle has come
     to an end, be careful not to get up at once, but withdraw your
     member cautiously. Remain close to the woman, and lie down on the
     right side of the bed that witnessed your enjoyment. You will find
     this pleasant, and you will not be like a fellow who mounts the
     woman after the fashion of a mule, without any regard to
     refinement, and who, after the emission, hastens to get his member
     out and to rise. Avoid such manners, for they rob the woman of all
     her lasting delight.
     
     In short, the true lover of coition will not fail to observe all
     that I have recommended; for, from the observance of my
     recommendations will result the pleasure of the woman, and these
     rules comprise everything essential in that respect.
     
     God has made everything for the best!

                                      
CHAPTER 6

  Concerning Everything That Is Favourable to the Act of Coition
  
   KNOW, O Vizir (God be good to you!), if you would have pleasant
   coition, which ought to give an equal share of happiness to the two
   combatants and be satisfactory to both, you must first of all toy with
   the woman, excite her with kisses, by nibbling and sucking her lips,
   by caressing her neck and cheeks. Turn her over in the bed, now on her
   back, now on her stomach, till you see by her eyes that the time for
   pleasure is near, as I have mentioned in the preceding chapter, and
   certainly I have not been sparing with my observations thereupon.
   
   Then when you observe the lips of a woman to tremble and get red, and
   her eyes to become languishing, and her sighs to become quicker, know
   that she is hot for coition; then get between her thighs, so that your
   member can enter into her vagina. If you allow my advice, you will
   enjoy a pleasant embrace, which will give you the greatest
   satisfaction, and leave with you a delicious remembrance.
   
   Someone has said:
   
     If you desire coition, place the woman on the ground, cling closely
     to her bosom, with her lips close to yours; then clasp her to you,
     suck her breath, bite her; kiss her breasts, her stomach, her
     flanks, press her close in your arms, so as to make her faint with
     pleasure; when you see her so far gone, then push your member into
     her. If you have done as I said, the enjoyment will come to both of
     you simultaneously. This it is which makes the pleasure of the
     woman so sweet. But if you neglect my advice the woman will not be
     satisfied and you will not have procured her any pleasure.
     
     The coition being finished, do not get up at once, but come down
     softly on her right side, and if she has conceived, she will bear a
     male child, if it please God on high!
     
   Sages and Savants (may God grant to all his forgiveness!) have said:
   
     If anyone placing his hand upon the vulva of a woman that is with
     child pronounces the following words: `In the name of God! may he
     grant salutation and mercy to his Prophet (salutation and mercy be
     with him). Oh! my God! I pray to thee in the name of the Prophet to
     let a boy issue from this conception,' it will come to pass by the
     will of God, and in consideration for our lord Mohammed (the
     salutation and grace of God be with him), the woman will be
     delivered of a boy.
     
   Do not drink rain-water directly after copulation, because this
   beverage weakens the kidneys.
   
   If you want to repeat the coition, perfume yourself with sweet scents,
   then close with the woman, and you will arrive at a happy result.
   
   Do not let the woman perform the act of coition mounted upon you, for
   fear that in that position some drops of her seminal fluid might enter
   the canal of your verge and cause a sharp urethritis.
   
   Do not work hard directly after coition as this might affect your
   health adversely, but go to rest for some time.
   
   Do not wash your verge directly after having withdrawn it from the
   vagina of the woman, until the irritation has gone down somewhat; then
   wash it and its opening carefully. Otherwise, do not wash your member
   frequently. Do not leave the vulva directly after the emission, as
   this may cause canker.
   
      Sundry Positions for the Coitus
      
   The ways of doing it to women are numerous and variable. And now is
   the time to make known to you the different positions which are usual.
   
   God, the magnificent, has said: `Women are your field. Go upon your
   field as you like.'
   
   According to your wish you can choose the position you like best,
   provided, of course, that coition takes place in the spot destined for
   it, that is, in the vulva.
   
   MANNER THE FIRST - Make the woman lie upon her back, with her thighs
   raised, then, getting between her legs, introduce your member into
   her. Pressing your toes to the ground, you can rummage her in a
   convenient, measured way. This is a good position for a man with a
   long verge.
   
   MANNER THE SECOND - If your member is a short one, let the woman lie
   on her back, lift her legs into the air, so that her right leg be near
   her right ear, and the left one near her left ear, and in this
   posture, with her buttocks lifted up, her vulva will project forward.
   Then put in your member.
   
   MANNER THE THIRD - Let the woman stretch herself upon the ground, and
   place yourself between her thighs; then putting one of her legs upon
   your shoulder, and the other under your arm, near the armpit, get into
   her.
   
   MANNER THE FOURTH - Let her lie down, and put her legs on your
   shoulders; in this position your member will just face her vulva,
   which must not touch the ground. And then introduce your member.
   
   MANNER THE FIFTH - Let her lie down on her side, then lie yourself
   down by her on your side, and getting between her thighs, put your
   member into her vagina. But sidelong coition predisposes for rheumatic
   pains and sciatica.
   
   MANNER THE SIXTH - Make her get down on her knees and elbows, as if
   kneeling in prayer. In this position the vulva is projected backwards;
   you then attack her from that side, and put your member into her.
   
   MANNER THE SEVENTH - Place the woman on her side, and squat between
   her thighs, with one of her legs on your shoulder and the other
   between your thighs, while she remains lying on her side. Then you
   enter her vagina, and make her move by drawing her towards your chest
   by means of your hands, with which you hold her embraced.
   
   MANNER THE EIGHTH - Let her stretch herself upon the ground, on her
   back, with her legs crossed; then mount her like a cavalier on
   horseback, being on your knees, while her legs are placed under her
   thighs, and put your member into her vagina.
   
   MANNER THE NINTH - Place the woman so that she leans with her front,
   or, if you prefer it, her back upon a moderate elevation, with her
   feet set upon the ground. She thus offers her vulva to the
   introduction of your member.
   
   MANNER THE TENTH - Place the woman near to a low divan, the back of
   which she can take hold of with her hands; then, getting under her,
   lift her legs to the height of your navel, and let her clasp you with
   her legs on each side of your body; in this position plant your verge
   into her, seizing with your hands the back of the divan. When you
   begin the action your movements must respond to those of the woman.
   
   MANNER THE ELEVENTH - Let her lie upon her back on the ground with a
   cushion under her posterior; then getting between her legs, and
   letting her place the sole of her right foot against the sole of her
   left foot, introduce your member.
   
   There are other positions besides the above named in use among the
   peoples of India. It is well for you to know that the inhabitants of
   those parts have multiplied the different ways to enjoy women, and
   they have advanced farther than we in the knowledge and investigation
   of coitus.
   
   Amongst those manners are the following, called:
   
    1. El asemeud, the stopperage
    2. El modefedâ frog fashion
    3. El mokefâ, with the toes cramped
    4. El mokeurmeutt, with legs in the air
    5. El setouri, he-goat fashion
    6. El loulabi, the screw of Archimedes
    7. El kelouci, the summersault
    8. Hachou en nekanok, the tail of the ostrich
    9. Lebeuss el djoureb, fitting on of the sock
   10. Kechef el astine, reciprocal sight of the posteriors

   FIRST MANNER - Et asemeud (the stopperage). Place the woman on her
   back, with a cushion under her buttocks, then get between her legs,
   resting the points of your feet against the ground; bend her two
   thighs against her chest as far as you can; place your hands under her
   arms so as to enfold her or cramp her shoulders. Then introduce your
   member, and at the moment of ejaculation draw her towards you. This
   position is painful for the woman, for her thighs being bent upwards
   and her buttocks raised by the cushion, the walls of her vagina
   tighten, and the uterus tending forward there is not much room for
   movement, and scarcely space enough for the intruder; consequently the
   latter enters with difficulty and strikes against the uterus. This
   position should therefore not be adopted, unless the man's member is
   short or soft.
   
   SECOND MANNER - El modefedâ (frog fashion). Place the woman on her
   back, and arrange her thighs so that they touch the heels, which
   latter are thus coming close to the buttocks; then down you sit in
   this kind of merry thought, facing the vulva, in which you insert your
   member; you then place her knees under your arm-pits; and taking firm
   hold of the upper part of her arms, you draw her towards you at the
   crisis.
   
   THIRD MANNER - El mokefâ (with the toes cramped). Place the woman on
   her back, and squat on your knees, between her thighs, gripping the
   ground with your toes; raise her knees as high as your sides, in order
   that she may cross her legs over your back, and then pass her arms
   round your neck.
   
   FOURTH MANNER - El mokeurmeutt (with legs in the air). The woman lying
   on her back, you put her thighs together and raise her legs up until
   the soles of her feet look at the ceiling; then enfolding her within
   your thighs you insert your member, holding her legs up with your
   hands.
   
   FIFTH MANNER - El setouri (he-goat fashion). The woman being crouched
   on her side, you let her stretch out the leg on which she is resting,
   and squat down between her thighs with your calves bent under you.
   Then you lift her uppermost leg so that it rests on your back, and
   introduce your member. During the action you take hold of her
   shoulders, or, if you prefer it, her arms.
   
   SIXTH MANNER - El loulabi (the screw of Archimedes). The man being
   stretched on his back the woman sits on his member, facing him; she
   then places her hands upon the bed so that she can keep her stomach
   from touching the man's, and moves up and downwards, and if the man is
   supple he assists her from below. If in this position she wants to
   kiss him, she need only stretch her arms along the bed.
   
   SEVENTH MANNER - El kelouci (the somersault). The woman must wear a
   pair of pantaloons, which she lets drop upon her heels; then she
   stoops, placing her head between her feet, so that her neck is in the
   opening of her pantaloons. At that moment, the man, seizing her legs,
   turns her upon her back, making her perform a summersault; then with
   his legs curved under him he brings his member right against her vulva
   and, slipping it between her legs, inserts it.
   
   It is alleged that there are women who, while lying on their back, can
   place their feet behind their head without the help of pantaloons or
   hands.
   
   EIGHTH MANNER - Hachou en nekanok (the tail of the ostrich). The woman
   lying on her back along the bed, the man kneels in front of her,
   lifting up her legs until her head and shoulders only are resting on
   the bed; his member having penetrated into her vagina, he seizes and
   sets into motion the buttocks of the woman who, on her part, twines
   her legs around his neck.
   
   NINTH MANNER - Lebeuss el djoureb (fitting on of the sock). The woman
   lies on her back. You sit down between her legs and place your member
   between the lips of her vulva, which you fit over it with your thumb
   and first finger; then you move so as to procure for your member, as
   far as it is in contact with the woman, a lively rubbing, which action
   you continue until her vulva gets moistened with the liquid emitted
   from your verge. When she is thus amply prepared for enjoyment by the
   alternate coming and going of your weapon in her scabbard, put it into
   her in full length.
   
   TENTH MANNER - Kechef el astine (reciprocal sight of the posteriors).
   The man lying stretched out on his back, the woman sits down upon his
   member with her back to the man's face, who presses her sides between
   his thighs and legs, whilst she places her hands upon the bed as a
   support for her movements and, lowering her head, her eyes are turned
   towards the buttocks of the man.
   
   ELEVENTH MANNER - Nezâ el kouss (the rainbow arch). The woman is lying
   on her side; the man also on his side, with his face towards her back,
   pushes in between her legs and introduces his member, with his hands
   lying on the upper part of her back. As to the woman, she then gets
   hold of the man's feet, which she lifts up as far as she can, drawing
   him close to her; thus she forms with the body of the man an arch, of
   which she is the rise.
   
   TWELFTH MANNER - Nesedj el kheuzz (the alternate movement of
   piercing). The man in sitting attitude places the soles of his feet
   together, and lowering his thighs, draws his feet nearer to his
   member; the woman sits down upon his feet, which he takes care to keep
   firm together. In this position the two thighs of the woman are
   pressed against the man's flanks, and she puts her arms round his
   neck. Then the man clasps the woman's ankles, and drawing his feet
   nearer to his body, brings the woman, who is sitting on them, within
   range of his member, which then enters her vagina. By moving his feet
   he sends her back and brings her forward again, without ever
   withdrawing his member entirely.
   
   The woman makes herself as light as possible, and assists as well as
   she can in this come-and-go movement; her co-operation is, in fact,
   indispensable for it. If the man apprehends that his member may come
   out entirely, he takes her round the waist, and she receives no other
   impulse than that which is imparted to her by the feet of the man upon
   which she is sitting.
   
   THIRTEENTH MANNER - Dok el arz (pounding on the spot). The man sits
   down with his legs stretched out; the woman then places herself
   astride on his thighs, crossing her legs behind the back of the man,
   and places her vulva opposite his member, which latter she guides into
   her vagina; she then places her arms round his neck, and he embraces
   her sides and waist, and helps her to rise and descend upon his verge.
   She must assist in his work.
   
   FOURTEENTH MANNER - Nik el kohoul (coitus from the back). The woman
   lies down on her stomach and raises her buttocks by help of a cushion;
   the man approaches from behind, stretches himself on her back and
   inserts his tool, while the woman twines her arms round the man's
   elbows. This is the easiest of all methods.
   
   FIFTEENTH MANNER - El keurchi (belly to belly). The man and the woman
   are standing upright, face to face; she opens her thighs; the man then
   brings his feet forward between those of the woman, who also advances
   hers a little. In this position the man must have one of his feet
   somewhat in advance of the other. Each of the two has the arms round
   the other's hips; the man introduces his verge, and the two move thus
   intertwined after a manner called Neza el dela, which I shall explain
   later, if it please God the Almighty. [See FIRST MOVEMENT]
   
   SIXTEENTH MANNER - El kebachi (after the fashion of the ram). The
   woman is on her knees, with her forearms on the ground; the man
   approaches from behind, kneels down, and lets his member penetrate
   into her vagina, which she presses out as much as possible; he will do
   well in placing his hands on the woman's shoulders.
   
   SEVENTEENTH MANNER - Dok el outed (driving the peg home). The woman
   enlaces with her legs the waist of the man, who is standing, with her
   arms passed round his neck, steadying herself by leaning against the
   wall. Whilst she is thus suspended the man insinuates his pin into her
   vulva.
   
   EIGHTEENTH MANNER - Sebek el heub (love's fusion). While the woman is
   lying on her right side, extend yourself on your left side; your left
   leg remains extended, and you raise your right one till it is up to
   her flank, when you lay her upper leg upon your side. Thus her
   uppermost leg serves the woman as a support for her back. After having
   introduced your member you move as you please, and she responds to
   your action as she pleases.
   
   NINETEENTH MANNER - Tred ech chate (coitus of the sheep). The woman is
   on her hands and knees; the man, behind her, lifts her thighs till her
   vulva is on a level with his member, which he then inserts. In this
   position she ought to place her head between her arms.
   
   TWENTIETH MANNER - Kalen el miche (interchange in coition). The man
   lies on his back. The woman, gliding in between his legs, places
   herself upon him with her toe-nails against the ground; she lifts up
   the man's thighs, turning them against his own body, so that his
   virile member faces her vulva, into which she guides it; she then
   places her hands upon the bed by the sides of the man. It is, however,
   indispensable that the woman's feet rest upon a cushion to enable her
   to keep her vulva in concordance with his member.
   
   In this position the parts are exchanged, the woman fulfilling that of
   the man, and vice-versa.
   
   There is a variation to this manner. The man stretches himself out
   upon his back, while the woman kneels with her legs under her, but
   between his legs. The remainder conforms exactly to what has been said
   above.
   
   TWENTY-FIRST MANNER - Rekeud el aïr (the race of the member). The man,
   on his back, supports himself with a cushion under his shoulders, but
   his posterior must retain contact with the bed. Thus placed, he draws
   up his thighs until his knees are on a level with his face; then the
   woman sits down, impaling herself on his member; she must not lie
   down, but keep seated as if on horseback, the saddle being represented
   by the knees and the stomach of the man. In that position she can, by
   the play of her knees, work up and down and down and up. She can also
   place her knees on the bed, in which case the man accentuates the
   movement by plying his thighs, whilst she holds with her left hand on
   to his right shoulder.
   
   TWENTY-SECOND MANNER - El modakheli (the fitter-in). The woman is
   seated on her coccyx, with only the points of her buttocks touching
   the ground; the man takes the same position, her vulva facing his
   member. Then the woman puts her right thigh over the left thigh of the
   man, whilst he on his part puts his right thigh over her left one.
   
   The woman, seizing with her hands her partner's arms, gets his member
   into her vulva; and each of them leaning alternately a little back,
   and holding each other by the upper part of the arms, they initiate a
   swaying movement, moving with little concussions, and keeping their
   movements in exact rhythm by the assistance of their heels. which are
   resting on the ground.
   
   TWENTY-THIRD MANNER - El khouariki (the one who stops at home). he
   woman being couched on her back, the man lies down upon her, with
   cushions held in his hands.
   
   After his member is in, the woman raises her buttocks as high as she
   can off the bed, the man following her up with his member well inside;
   then the woman lowers herself again upon the bed, giving some short
   shocks, and although they do not embrace, the man must stick like glue
   to her. This movement they continue, but the man must make himself
   light and must not be ponderous, and the bed must be soft; in default
   of which the exercise cannot be kept up without break
   
   TWENTY-FOURTH MANNER - Nik el haddadi (the coition of the blacksmith).
   The woman lies on her back with a cushion under her buttocks, and her
   knees raised as far as possible towards her chest, so that her vulva
   stands out as a target; she then guides her partner's member in.
   
   The man executes for some time the usual action of coition, then draws
   his tool out of the vulva, and glides it for a moment between the
   thighs of the woman, as the smith withdraws the glowing iron from the
   furnace in order to plunge it into cold water. This manner is called
   sferdgeli, position of the quince.
   
   TWENTY-FIFTH MANNER - El moheundi (the seducer). The woman lying on
   her back, the man sits between her legs, with his croupe on his feet;
   then he raises and separates the women's thighs, placing her legs
   under his arms, or over his shoulders; he then takes her round the
   waist, or seizes her shoulders.
   
   The preceding descriptions furnish a large number of procedures, that
   cannot well be all put to the proof; but with such a variety to choose
   from, the man who finds one of them difficult to practise, can easily
   find plenty of others more to his convenience.
   
   I have not made mention of positions which it appeared to me
   impossible to realize, and if there be anybody who thinks that those
   which I have described are not exhaustive, he has only to look for new
   ones.
   
   It cannot be gainsaid that the Indians have surmounted the greatest
   difficulties in respect to coition. As a grand exploit, originating
   with them, the following may be cited:
   
     The woman being stretched out on her back, the man sits down on her
     chest, with his back turned to her face, his knees turned forward
     and his nails gripping the ground; he then raises her hips, arching
     her back until he has brought her vulva face to face with his
     member, which he then inserts, and thus gains his purpose.
     
   This position, as you perceive, is very fatiguing and very difficult
   to attain. I even believe that the only realization of it consists in
   words and designs. With regard to the other methods described above,
   they can only be practised if both man and woman are free from
   physical defects, and of analogous construction; for instance, one or
   the other of them must not be hunchbacked, or very little, or very
   tall, or too obese. And I repeat, that both must be in perfect health.
   
   I shall now treat of coition between two persons of different
   conformation. I shall particularise the positions that will suit them
   in treating each of them severally.
   
   I shall first discourse of the coition of a lean man and a corpulent
   woman, and the different postures they may assume for the act,
   assuming the woman to be lying down, and being turned successively
   over on her four sides.
   
   If the man wants to work her sideways he takes the thigh of the woman
   which is uppermost, and raises it as high as possible on his flank, so
   that it rests over his waist; he employs her undermost arm as a pillow
   for the support of his head, and he takes care to place a stout
   cushion beneath his undermost hip, so as to elevate his member to the
   necessary height, which is indispensable on account of the thickness
   of the woman's thighs.
   
   But if the woman has an enormous abdomen, projecting by reason of its
   obesity over her thighs and flanks, it will be best to lay her on her
   hack, and to lift up her thighs towards her belly; the man kneels
   between them, having hold of her waist with his hands, and drawing her
   towards him; and if he cannot manage her in consequence of the obesity
   of her belly and thighs, he must with his two arms encircle her
   buttocks, But it is thus impossible for him to work her conveniently,
   owing to the want of mobility of her thighs, which are impeded by her
   belly. He may, however, support them with his hands, but let him take
   care not to place them over his own thighs, as, owing to their weight,
   he would not have the power nor the facility to move. As the poet has
   said:
   
     If you have to explore her, lift up her buttocks,
     In order to work like the rope thrown to a drowning man.
     You will then seem between her thighs
     Like a rower seated at the end of the boat.
     
   The man can likewise couch the woman on her side, with the innermost
   leg in front; then he sits down on the thigh of that leg, his member
   being opposite her vulva, and lets her raise the upper leg, which she
   must bend at the knee. Then, with his hands seizing her legs bind
   thighs, he introduces his member, with his body lying between her
   legs, his knees bent, and the points of his feet against the ground,
   so that he can elevate his posterior, and prevent her thighs from
   impeding the entrance. In this attitude they can enter into action.
   
   If the woman's belly is enlarged by reason of her being with child,
   the man lets her lie down on one side; then placing one of her thighs
   over the other, he raises them both towards the stomach, without their
   touching the latter; he then lies down behind her on the same side,
   and can thus fit his member in. In this way he can thrust his tool in
   entirely, particularly by raising his foot, which is under the woman's
   leg, to the height of her thigh. The same may be done with a barren
   woman; but It is particularly to be recommended for the woman who is
   enceinte, as the above position offers the advantage of procuring her
   the pleasure she desires, without exposing her to any danger.
   
   In the case of the man being obese, with a very pronounced rotundity
   of stomach, and the woman being thin, the best course to follow is to
   let the woman take the active part. To this end, the man lies down on
   his back with his thighs close together, and the woman lowers herself
   upon his member, astride of him; she rests her hands upon the bed, and
   he seizes her arms with his hands. If she knows how to move, she can
   thus, in turn, rise and sink upon his member; if she is not adroit
   enough for that movement, the man imparts a movement to her buttocks
   by the play of one of his thighs behind them. But if the man assumes
   this position, it may sometimes become prejudicial to him, inasmuch as
   some of the female sperm may penetrate into his urethra, and grave
   malady may ensue therefrom. It may also happen - and that is just as
   bad - that the man's sperm cannot pass out, and returns into the
   urethra.
   
   If the man prefers that the woman should lie on her back, he places
   himself, with his legs folded under him, between her legs, which she
   parts only moderately. Thus, his buttocks are between the woman's
   legs, with his heels touching them. In performing this way he will,
   however, feel fatigue, owing to the position of his stomach resting
   upon the woman's, and the inconvenience resulting therefrom; and,
   besides, he will not be able to get his whole member in the vulva.
   
   It will be similar when both he on their sides, as mentioned above in
   the case of pregnant women.
   
   When both man and woman are fat, and wish to unite in coition, they
   cannot contrive to do it without trouble, particularly when both have
   prominent stomachs. In these circumstances the best way to go about it
   is for the woman to be on her knees with her hands on the ground, so
   that her posterior is elevated; then the man separates her legs,
   leaving the points of the feet close together and the heels parted
   asunder; he then attacks her from behind, kneeling and holding up his
   stomach with his hand, and so introduces his member. Resting his
   stomach upon her buttocks during the act he holds the thighs or the
   waist of the woman with his hands. If her posterior is too low for his
   stomach to rest upon, he must place a cushion under her knees to
   remedy this.
   
   I know of no other position so favourable as this for the coition of a
   fat man with a fat woman.
   
   If, in fact, the man gets between the legs of a woman on her back
   under the above-named circumstances, his stomach, encountering the
   woman's thighs, will not allow him to make free use of his tool. He
   cannot even see her vulva, or only in part; it may be almost said that
   it will be impossible for him to accomplish the act.
   
   On the other hand, if the man makes the woman lie upon her side, and
   then places himself, with his legs bent behind her, pressing his
   stomach upon the upper part of her posterior, she must draw her legs
   and thighs up to her stomach, in order to lay bare her vagina and
   allow the introduction of his member; but if she cannot sufficiently
   bend her knees, the man can neither see her vulva, nor explore it.
   
   If, however, the stomach of each person is not exaggeratedly large,
   they can manage very well all positions. Only they must not be too
   long in coming to the crisis, as they will soon feel fatigued and lose
   their breath.
   
   In the case of a very big man and a very little woman, the difficulty
   to be solved is how to contrive that their organs of generation and
   their mouths can meet at the same time. To gain this end the woman had
   best lie on her back; the man places himself on his side near her,
   passes one of his hands under her neck, and with the other raises her
   thighs till he can put his member against her vulva from behind, the
   woman remaining still on her back. In this position he holds her up
   with his hands by the neck and the thighs. He can then enter her body,
   while the woman on her part puts her arms round his neck, and
   approaches her lips to his.
   
   If the man wishes the woman to lie on her side, he gets between her
   legs, and, placing her thighs so that they are `in contact with his
   sides, one above and one under, he glides in between them till his
   member is lacing her vulva from behind; he then presses his thighs
   against her buttocks, which he seizes with one hand in order to impart
   movement to them; the other hand he has round her neck. If the man
   then likes, he can get his thighs over those of the woman, and press
   her towards him; this will make it easier for him to move.
   
   As regards the copulation of a very small man and a tall woman, the
   two actors cannot kiss each other while in action unless they take one
   of the three following positions, and even then they will become
   fatigued.
   
   FIRST POSITION - The woman lies on her back, with a thick cushion
   under her buttocks, and a similar one under her head; she then draws
   up her thighs as far as possible towards her chest. The man lies down
   upon her, introduces his member, and takes hold of her shoulders,
   drawing himself up towards them. The woman winds her arms and legs
   round his back, whilst he holds on to her shoulders, or, if he can, to
   her neck.
   
   SECOND POSITION - Man and woman lie both on their side, face to face;
   the woman slips her undermost thigh under the man's flank, drawing it
   at the same time higher up; she does the like with her other thigh
   over his; then she arches her stomach out, while his member is
   penetrating into her. Both should have hold of the other's neck, and
   the woman, crossing her legs over his back, should draw the man
   towards her.
   
   THIRD POSITION - The man lies on his back, with his legs stretched
   out; the woman sits on his member, and, stretching herself down over
   him, draws up her knees to the height of her stomach; then, laying her
   hands over his shoulders, she draws herself up, and presses her lips
   to his.
   
   All these postures are more or less fatiguing for both; people can,
   however, choose any other position they like; but they must be able to
   Kiss each other during the act.
   
   I will now speak to you of those who are little, in consequence of
   being humpbacked. Of these there are several kinds.
   
   First, there is the man who is crookbacked, but whose spine and neck
   are straight. For him it is most convenient to unite himself with a
   little woman, but not otherwise than from behind. Placing himself
   behind her posterior, he thus introduces his member into her vulva.
   But if the woman is in a stooping attitude, on her hands and feet, he
   will do still better. If the woman be afflicted with a hump and the
   man is straight, the same position is suitable.
   
   If both of them are crookbacked they can take what position they like
   for coition. They cannot, however, embrace; and if they lie on their
   side, face to face, there will be left an empty space between them.
   And if one or the other lies down on the back, a cushion must be
   placed under the head and the shoulder, to hold them up, and fill the
   place which is left vacant.
   
   In the case of a man whose malformation affects only his neck, so as
   to press his chin towards his chest, but who is otherwise straight, he
   can take any position he likes for doing the business, and give
   himself up to any embraces and caresses, always excepting kisses on
   the mouth. If the woman is lying on her back, he will appear in action
   as if he were butting at her like a ram. If the woman has her neck
   deformed in similar manner, their coition will resemble the mutual
   attack of two horned beasts with their heads. The most convenient
   position fur them will be that the woman should stoop down, and he
   attack her from behind. The man whose hump appears on his back in the
   shape of only the half of a jar is not so much disfigured as the one
   of whom the poet has said:
   
     Lying on his back he is a dish;
     Turn him over, and you have a dish-cover
     
   In his case coition can take place as with any other man who is small
   in stature and straight; he cannot, however, easily lie on his back.
   
   If a little woman is lying on her back, with a humpbacked man upon her
   belly, he will look like the cover over a vase. If, on the contrary,
   the woman is large-sized, he will have the appearance of a carpenter's
   plane in action. I have made the following verses on this subject:
   
     The humpback is vaulted like an arch; And seeing him you cry,
     `Glory be to God!' You ask him how he manages in coitus? `It is the
     retribution for my sins,' he says. The woman under him is like a
     board of deal; The humpback, who explores her, does the planing.
     
   I have also said in verse:
   
     The humpback's dorsal cord is tied in knots, The Angels tire with
     writing all his sins; In trying for a wife of proper shape, And for
     her favours, she repulses him, And says, `Who bears the wrongs we
     shall commit?' And he, `I bear them well upon my hump!' And then
     she mocks him saying, `Oh, you plane Destined for making shavings!
     Take a deal board!'
     
   If the woman has a hump as well as the man, they may take any of the
   various positions for coition, always observing that if one of them
   lies on the back, the hump must be environed with cushion, as with a
   turban, thus having a nest to lie in, which guards its top, which is
   very tender. In this way they can embrace closely.
   
   If the man is humped both on back and chest he must renounce the
   embrace and the clinging, but can otherwise take any position he likes
   for coition. Yet generally speaking, the action must always be
   troublesome for himself and the woman. I have written on this subject:
   
     The humpback engaged in the act of coition Is like a vase provided
     with two handles. If he is burning fur a woman, she will tell him,
     `Your hump is in the way; you cannot do it; Your verge would find a
     place to rummage in, But on your chest the hump where would it be?'
     
   If both the woman and the man have double humps, the best position
   they can assume for coitus is the following: Whilst the woman is lying
   on her side, the man introduces his member after the fashion described
   previously in respect to pregnant women. Thus the two humps do not
   encounter one another. Both are lying on their sides, and the man
   attacks from behind. Should the woman be on her back, her hump must be
   supported by a cushion, whilst the man kneels between her legs, she
   holding up her posterior. Thus placed, their two humps are not near
   each other, and all inconvenience is avoided.
   
   The same is the case if the woman stoops down with her head, with her
   croup in the air, after the manner of el kouri, which position will
   suit both of them, if they have the chest malformed, but not the back.
   One of them then performs the action of come-and-go.
   
   But the most curious and amusing description which I have ever met in
   this respect, is contained in these verses:
   
     Their two extremities are close together, And nature made a
     laughing stock of them; Foreshortened he appears as if cut off; He
     looks like someone bending to escape a blow, Or like a man who has
     received a blow And shrivels down so as to miss a second.
     
   If a man's spine is curved about the hips and his back is straight, so
   that he looks as though he was in prayer, half prostrated, coition for
   him is very difficult; owing to the reciprocal positions of his thighs
   and his stomach, he cannot possibly insert his member entirely, as it
   lies so far back between his thighs. The best for him to do is to
   stand up. The woman stoops down before him with her hands to the
   ground and her posterior in the air; he can thus introduce his member
   as a pivot for the woman to move upon, for, be it observed, he cannot
   well move himself. It is the manner el kouri, with the difference,
   that it is the woman who moves.
   
   A man may be attacked by the illness called ikaad, or zomana
   (paralysis), which compels him to be constantly seated. If this malady
   only affects his knees and legs, his thighs and spinal column
   remaining sound, he can use all the sundry positions for coition,
   except those where he would have to stand up. In the case of his
   buttocks being affected, even if he is otherwise perfectly well, it is
   the woman who will have to make all the movements.
   
   Know that the most enjoyable coitus does not always exist in the
   manners described here; I only give them, so as to render this work as
   complete as possible. Sometimes most enjoyable coition takes place
   between lovers, who, not quite perfect in their proportions, find
   their own means for their mutual gratification.
   
   It is said that there are women of great experience who, lying with a
   man, elevate one of their feet vertically in the air, and upon that
   foot a lamp is set full of oil, and with the wick burning. While the
   man is ramming them, they keep the lamp steady and burning, and the
   oil is not spilled. Their coition is in no way impeded by this
   exhibition, but it must require great previous practice on the part of
   both.
   
   Assuredly the Indian writers have in their works described a great
   many ways of making love, but the majority of them do not yield
   enjoyment, and give more pain than pleasure. That which is to be
   looked for in coition, the crowning point of it, is the enjoyment, the
   embrace, the kisses. This is the distinction between the coitus of men
   and that of animals. No one is indifferent to the enjoyment which
   proceeds from the difference between the sexes, and the man finds his
   highest felicity in it.
   
   If the desire of love in man is roused to its highest pitch, all the
   pleasure of coition becomes easy for him, and he satisfies his
   yearning in anyway.
   
   It is well for the lover of coition to put all these manners to the
   proof, o as to ascertain which is the position that gives the greatest
   pleasure to both combatants. Then he will know which to choose for the
   tryst, bind in satisfying his desires retain the woman's affection.
   
   Many people have essayed all the positions I have described, but none
   has been as much approved of as the dok el arz.
   
   A story is told on this subject of a man who had a wife of
   incomparable beauty, graceful and accomplished. He used to explore her
   in the ordinary manner, never having recourse to any other. The woman
   experienced none of the pleasure which ought to accompany the act, and
   was consequently generally very moody after the coition was over.
   
   The man complained about this to an old dame, who told him, `Try
   different ways in uniting yourself to her, until you find the one
   which best satisfies her. Then work her in this fashion only, and her
   affection tor you will know no limit.'
   
   He then tried upon his wife various manners of coition, and when he
   came to the one called dok el arz he saw her overcome by violent
   transports of love, and at the crisis of pleasure he felt her womb
   grasp his verge energetically; and she said to him, biting his lips,
   `This is the veritable manner of making love!'
   
   These demonstrations proved to the lover, in fact, that his mistress
   felt in that position the most lively pleasure, and he always
   thenceforward worked with her in that way. Thus he attained his end,
   and caused the woman to love him to folly.
   
   Therefore try different manners; for every woman likes one in
   preference to all other for her pleasure. The majority of them have,
   however, a predilection for the dok el arz, as, in the application of
   the same, belly is pressed to belly, mouth glued to mouth, and the
   action of the womb is rarely absent.
   
   I have now only to mention the various movements practised during
   coitus, and shall describe some of them.
   
   FIRST MOVEMENT - Neza el dela (the bucket in the well). The man and
   woman join in close embrace after the introduction. Then he gives a
   push, and withdraws a little; the woman follows him with a push, and
   also retires. So they continue their alternate movement, keeping
   proper time. Placing foot against foot, and hand against hand, they
   keep up the motion of a bucket in a well.
   
   SECOND MOVEMENT - El netahi (the mutual shock). After the
   introduction, they each draw back, but without dislodging the member
   completely. Then they both push tightly together, and thus go on
   keeping time.
   
   THIRD MOVEMENT - El motadani (the approach). The man moves as usual,
   and then stops. Then the woman, with the member in her receptacle,
   begins to move like the man, and then stops. And they continue this
   way until the ejaculation comes.
   
   FOURTH MOVEMENT - Khiate el heub (love's tailor). The man, with his
   member being only partially inserted in the vulva, keeps up a sort of
   quick friction with the part that is in, and then suddenly plunges his
   whole member in up to its root. This is the movement of the needle in
   the hands of die tailor, of which the man and woman must take
   cognisance.
   
   Such a movement only suits those men and women who can at will retard
   the crisis. With those who are otherwise constituted it would act too
   quickly.
   
   FIFTH MOVEMENT - Souak el feurdj (the toothpick in the vulva). The man
   introduces his member between the walls of the vulva, and then drives
   it up and down, and right and left. Only a man with a very vigorous
   member can execute this movement.
   
   SIXTH MOVEMENT - Tâhik el heub (the boxing up of love). The man
   introduces his member entirely into the vagina, so closely that his
   hairs are completely mixed up with the woman's. In that position he
   must now move forcibly, without withdrawing his tool in the least.
   
   This is the best of all the movements, and is particularly well
   adapted to the position dok el arz. Women prefer it to any other kind,
   as it procures them the extreme pleasure of seizing the member with
   their womb; and appeases their lust most completely.
   
   Those women called tribades always use this movement m their mutual
   caresses. And it provokes prompt ejaculation both with man and woman.
   
   Without kissing, no kind of position or movement procures the fullest
   pleasure; and those positions in which the kiss is not practicable are
   not entirely satisfactory, considering that the kiss is one of the
   most powerful stimulants to the work of love.
   
   I have said in verse:
   
     The languishing eye
     Puts in connection soul with soul,
     And the tender kiss
     Takes the message from member to vulva.
     
   The kiss is assumed to be an integral part of coition. The best kiss
   is the one impressed on humid lips combined with the suction of the
   lips and tongue, which latter particularly provokes the flow of sweet
   and fresh saliva. It is for the man to bring this about by slightly
   and softly nibbling his partner's tongue, when her saliva will flow
   sweet and exquisite, more pleasant than refined honey, and which will
   not mix with the saliva of her mouth. This manoeuvre will give the man
   a trembling sensation, which will run all through his body, and is
   more intoxicating than wine drink to excess.
   
   A poet has said:
   
     In kissing her, I have drunk from her mouth Like a camel that
     drinks from the redir; Her embrace and the freshness of her mouth
     Give me a languor that goes to my marrow.
     
   The kiss should be sonorous; it originates with the tongue touching
   the palate, lubricated by saliva. It is produced by the movement of
   the tongue in the mouth and by the displacement of the saliva,
   provoked by the suction.
   
   The kiss given to the superficial outer part of the lips, and making a
   noise comparable to the one by which you call your cat, gives no
   pleasure. It is well enough thus applied to children and hands.
   
   The kiss I have described above is the one for coitus and is full of
   voluptuousness.
   
   A vulgar proverb says:
   
     A humid kiss
     Is better than a hurried coitus.
     
   I have composed on this subject the following lines:
   
     You kiss my hand - my mouth should be the place!
     O woman, thou who art my idol!
     It was a fond kiss you gave me, but it is lost,
     The hand cannot appreciate the nature of a kiss.
     
   The three words, kobla, letsem, and bouss are used indifferently to
   indicate the kiss on the hand or on the mouth. The word ferame means
   specially the kiss on the mouth.
   
   An Arab poet has said:
   
     The heart of love can find no remedy
     In witching sorcery nor amulets,
     Nor in the fond embrace without a kiss,
     Nor in a kiss without coitus.
     
   And the author of the work, The Jewels of the Bride and the Rejoicing
   of Souls, has added to the above, as complement and commentary, the
   two following verses:
   
     Nor in converse, however unrestrained,
     But in the placing of legs on legs (coition).
     
   Remember that all caresses and all sorts of kisses, as described, are
   of no account without the introduction of the member. Therefore
   abstain from then,, if you do not want action; they only fan a fire to
   no purpose. The passion which is excited resembles in fact a fire
   which is being lighted; and just as water only can extinguish the
   latter, so only the emission of the sperm can calm the lust and
   appease the heat.
   
   The woman is not more advantaged than the man by caresses without
   coition.
   
   It is said that Dahama bent Mesedjel appeared before the Governor of
   the province of Yamama, with her father and her husband, El Adjadje,
   alleging that the latter was impotent, and did not cohabit with her
   nor come near her.
   
   Her father, who assisted her in her case, was reproached for mixing
   himself up with her plaint by the people of Yamama, who said to him,
   `Are you not ashamed to help your daughter in bringing a claim for
   coition?'
   
   To which he answered, `It is my wish that she should have children; if
   she loses them it will be by God's will; if she brings them up they
   will be useful to her.'
   
   Dahama formulated her claim thus in coming before the Governor: `There
   stands my husband, and until now he has never touched me.' The
   Governor interposed, saying, `No doubt this is because you have been
   unwilling?' `On the contrary,' she replied, `it is for him that I open
   my thighs and lie down on my back' Then cried the husband, `O Emir,
   she tells untruth; in order to possess her I have to fight with her.'
   The Emir pronounced the following judgment: `I give you,' he said, `a
   year's time to prove her allegation to be false.' He decided thus out
   of regard for the man. El Adjadje then went away reciting those
   verses:
   
     Dahama and her father Mesedjel thought
     The Emir would decide upon my impotence.
     Is not the stallion sometimes lazy-minded?
     And yet he is so large and vigorous.
     
   Returned to his house he began to kiss and caress his wife; but his
   efforts went no farther, he remained incapable of giving proof of his
   virility. Dahama said to him, `Keep your caresses and embraces; they
   do not satisfy love. What I desire is a solid and stiff member, the
   sperm of which will flow into my matrix.' And she recited to him the
   following verses:
   
     Before God! it is in vain to try with kisses
     To entertain me, and with your embracings!
     To still my torments I must feel a member,
     Ejaculating sperm into my uterus.
     
   El Adjadje, in despair, conducted her forthwith back to her family,
   and, to hide his shame, repudiated her that very night.
   
   A poet said on that occasion:
   
     What are caresses to an ardent woman,
     Or costly vestments and fine jewellery,
     If the man's organs do not meet her own,
     And she is yearning for the virile verge?
     
   Know then that the majority of women do not find full satisfaction in
   kisses and embraces without coition. For them satisfaction resides
   only in the member, and they like the man who rummages them, even if
   he is ugly and misshapen.
   
   A story also goes on this subject that Moussa ben Mesâb betook himself
   one day to a woman in the town who had a female slave, an excellent
   singer, whom he wanted to buy from her. This woman was resplendently
   beautiful, and independent of her charming appearance, she had a large
   fortune. He saw at the same time in the house a young man of bad shape
   and ungainly appearance, who went to and fro giving orders.
   
   Moussa asked who the man was, she told him, `This is my husband, and
   for him I would give my life!' `This is a hard slavery,' he said, `to
   which you are reduced, and I am sorry for you. We belong to God, and
   shall return to him but what a misfortune it is that such incomparable
   beauty and such delightful forms as I see in you should be for such a
   man!'
   
   She made answer, `O son of my mother, if he could do to you from
   behind what he does for me in front, you would sell your lately
   acquired fortune as well as your patrimony. He would appear to you
   beautiful, and his plain looks would be changed into beauty.'
   
   `May God preserve him to you!' said Moussa
   
   It s also said that the poet Farazdak met one day a woman on whom he
   cast a glance burning with love, and who for that reason thus
   addressed him: `What makes you look at me in this fashion? Had I a
   thousand vulvas, there would be nothing to hope for for you!' `And
   why?' said the poet. `Because your appearance is not prepossessing,'
   she said, `and what you keep hidden will be no better.' He replied,
   `If you would put me to the proof, you would find that my interior
   qualities are of a nature to make you forget my outer appearance.' He
   then uncovered himself, and let her see a member the size of the arm
   of a young girl. At that sight she felt herself burning hot with
   amorous desire. He saw this, and asked her to let him caress her. Then
   she uncovered herself and showed him her mount of Venus, vaulted like
   a cupola.
   
   He then did the business for her, and recited these verses:
   
     I have plied in her my member, big as a virgin's arm;
     A member with a round head, and prompt to attack;
     Measuring in length a span and a half,
     And, oh! I felt as though I had put it in a brazier.
     
   He who seeks the pleasure a woman can give must satisfy her amorous
   desire for hot caresses, as described. He will see her swooning with
   lust, her vulva will get moist, her womb will stretch forward, and the
   two sperms will come together.

                                      
CHAPTER 7

  O Matters Which Are Injurious in the Act of Generation
  
   Know, O Vizir (to whom God be good!), that the ills caused by coition
   are numerous. I will mention to you some of them, which to know is
   essential, in order to be able to avoid them.
   
   Let me tell you in the first place that coition if performed standing
   affects the knee-joints and brings about nervous shiverings; and if
   performed sideways will predispose your system for gout and sciatica,
   which resides chiefly in the hip joint.
   
   Do not mount upon a woman fasting or immediately before making a meal,
   or else you will have pains in your back, you will lose your vigour,
   and your eyesight will get weaker.
   
   If you do it with the woman bestriding you, your dorsal cord will
   suffer and your heart will be affected; and if in that position the
   smallest drop of the usual secretions of the vagina enters your
   urethral canal, a painful stricture may supervene.
   
   Do not leave your member in the vulva after ejaculation, as this might
   cause gravel, or softening of the vertebral column, or the rupture of
   blood vessels or, lastly, inflammation of the lungs.
   
   Too much exercise after coition is also detrimental.
   
   Avoid washing your member after the copulation, as this may cause
   canker.
   
   As to coition with old women, it acts like a fatal poison, and it has
   been said, `Do not rummage old women, were they as rich as Karoun.'
   And it has further been said, `Beware of mounting old women; even if
   they cover you with favours.' And again, `The coitus of old women is a
   venomous meal.'
   
   Know that the man who works a woman younger than he is himself
   acquires new vigour; if she is of the same age as he is he will derive
   no advantage from it; and, finally, if it is a woman older than
   himself she will take all his strength out of him for herself. The
   following verses treat on this subject:
   
     Be on your guard and shun coition with old women;
     In her bosom she bears the poison of the arakime.
     
   A proverb says also, `Do not serve an old woman, even if she offered
   to feed you with semolina and almond bread.'
   
   The excessive practice of coition injures the health on account of the
   expenditure of too much sperm. For as butter made of cream represents
   the quintessence of the milk, and if you take the cream off, the milk
   loses its qualities, even so does the sperm form the quintessence of
   nutrition, and its loss is debilitating. On the other hand, the
   condition of the body, and consequently the quality of the sperm
   depends directly upon the food you take. If, therefore, a man will
   passionately give himself up to the enjoyment of coition, without
   undergoing too great fatigue, he must live upon strengthening food,
   exciting comfits, aromatic plants, meat, honey, eggs, and other
   similar viands. He who follows such a regime is protected against the
   following accidents, to which excessive coition may lead.
   
   Firstly, the loss of generative power.
   
   Secondly, the deterioration of his sight; for although he may not
   become blind, he will at least have to suffer from eye diseases if he
   does not follow my advice.
   
   Thirdly, the loss of his physical strength; he may become like the man
   who wants to fly but cannot, who pursuing somebody cannot catch him,
   or who carrying a burden, or working, soon gets tired and prostrated.
   
   He who does not want to feel the necessity for coition uses camphor.
   Half of a mitskal of this substance, macerated in water, makes the man
   who drinks of it insensible to the pleasures of copulation. Many women
   use this remedy when in fits of jealousy against rivals, or when they
   need repose after great excesses. Then they try to procure camphor
   that has been left after a burial, and shrink from no expense of money
   to get such from the old women who have the charge of the corpses.
   They also make use of the flower of henna, which is called faria; they
   macerate the same in water, until it turns yellow, and thus supply
   themselves with a beverage which has almost the same effect as
   camphor.
   
   I have treated of these remedies in the present chapter, although this
   is not their proper place; but I thought that this information, as
   here given, may be of use to many persons.
   
   There are certain things which will become injurious if constantly
   indulged in and which in the end affect the health. Such are: too much
   sleep, long voyages in unfavourable season, which latter, particularly
   in cold countries, may weaken the body and cause disease of the spine.
   The same effects may arise from the habitual handling of those bodies
   which engender cold and humidity, like plaster, etc.
   
   For people who have difficulty in passing water, coitus is hurtful.
   
   The habit of consuming acid food is debilitating.
   
   To keep one's member in the vulva of a woman after ejaculation has
   taken place, be it for a long or a short time, enfeebles that organ
   and makes it less fit for coition.
   
   If you are lying with a woman, do her business several times if you
   feel inclined, but take care not to overdo it, for it is a true word
   that, `He who plays the game of love for his own sake, and to satisfy
   his desires, feels the most intense and durable pleasure; but he who
   does it to satisfy the lust of another person will languish, lose all
   his desire, and finish by becoming impotent for coition.'
   
   The sense of these words is, that a man when he feels disposed for it
   can give himself up to the exercise of coitus with more or less ardour
   according to his desires, and at the time which best suits him,
   without any fear of future impotence, if his enjoyment is provoked and
   regulated only by his feeling the want of lying with a woman.
   
   But he who makes love for the sake of somebody else, that is to say
   only to satisfy the passion of his mistress, and tries all he can to
   attain that impossibility, that man will act against his own interest
   and imperil his health to please another person.
   
   As injurious may be considered coition in the bath or immediately
   after leaving the bath; after having been bled or purged or suchlike.
   Coitus after a heavy bout of drinking is likewise to be avoided. To
   indulge coitus with a woman during her courses is as detrimental to
   the man as to the woman herself, as at that time her blood is vitiated
   and her womb cold, and if the least drop of blood should get in the
   man's urinary canal numerous maladies may supervene. As to the woman,
   she feels no pleasure during her courses, and at such time holds
   coitus in aversion.
   
   As regards copulation in the bath, some say that there is no pleasure
   to be derived from it, if, as is believed, the degree of enjoyment is
   dependent upon the warmth of the vulva; for in the bath the vulva
   cannot be otherwise than cold, and consequently unfit for giving
   pleasure. And it is besides not to be forgotten that the water
   penetrating into the sexual parts of man or woman may lead to grave
   consequences.'
   
   Coitus after a full meal may occasion rupture of the intestines. It is
   also to be avoided after undergoing much fatigue, or at a time of very
   hot or very cold weather.
   
   Amongst the accidents which may attend the act of coition in hot
   countries may be mentioned sudden blindness without any previous
   symptoms.
   
   The repetition of the coitus without washing the parts ought to be
   shunned, as it may enfeeble the virile power.
   
   The man must also abstain from copulation with his wife if he is in a
   state of legal impurity, for if she should become pregnant by such
   coition the child could not be sound.
   
   After ejaculation do not remain close to the woman, as the disposition
   for recommencing will suffer by doing so.
   
   Care is to be taken not to carry heavy loads on one's back or to
   over-exert the mind, if one does not want the coitus to be impeded. It
   is also not good constantly to wear vestments made of silk, as they
   impair all the energy for copulation.
   
   Silken cloths worn by women also affect injuriously the capacity for
   erection of the virile member.
   
   Fasting, if prolonged, calms sexual desire; but in the beginning it
   excites the same.
   
   Abstain from greasy liquids, as in the course of time they diminish
   the strength necessary for coition.
   
   The effect of snuff, whether plain or scented, is similar.
   
   It is bad to wash the sexual parts with cold water directly after
   copulation; in general, washing with cold water calms down the desire,
   while warm water strengthens it.
   
   Conversation with a young woman excites in a man the erection and
   passion commensurate with the youthfulness of the woman.
   
   An Arab addressed the following recommendation to his daughter at the
   time when he conducted her to her husband: `Perfume yourself with
   water!' meaning that she should frequently wash her body with water in
   preference to perfumes; the latter, moreover, not being suitable for
   everyone.
   
   It is also reported that a woman having said to her husband, `You are
   then a nobody, as you never perfume yourself!' he made answer, `Oh,
   you sloven! it is for the woman to emit a sweet odour.'
   
   The abuse of coition is followed by loss of the taste for its
   pleasures; and to remedy this loss the sufferer must anoint his member
   with a mixture of the blood of a he-goat with honey. This will procure
   for him a marvellous effect in making love.
   
   It is said that reading the Koran also predisposes for copulation.
   
   Remember that a prudent man will beware of abusing the enjoyment of
   coition. The sperm is the water of life; if you use it economically
   you will always be ready for love's pleasures; it is the light of your
   eye; do not be lavish with it at all times and whenever you have a
   fancy for enjoyment, for if you are not sparing with it you will
   expose yourself to many ills. Wise medical men say, `A robust
   constitution is indispensable for copulation, and he who is endowed
   with it may give himself up to the pleasure without danger; but it is
   otherwise with the weakly man; he runs into danger by indulging freely
   with women.
   
   The sage, Es Sakli, has thus determined the limits to be observed by
   man as to the indulgence of the pleasures of coition: Man, be he
   phlegmatic or sanguine, should not make love more than twice or thrice
   a month; bilious or hypochondriac men only once or twice a month. It
   is nevertheless a well-established fact that nowadays men of any of
   these four temperaments are insatiable as to coition, and give
   themselves up to it day and night, taking no heed how they expose
   themselves to numerous ills, both internal and external.
   
   Women are more favoured than men in indulging their passion for
   coition. it is in fact their speciality; and for them it is all
   pleasure; while men run many risks in abandoning themselves without
   reserve to the pleasures of love.
   
   Having thus treated of the dangers which may occur from the coitus, I
   have considered it useful to bring to your knowledge the following
   verses, which contain hygienic advice in their respect. These verses
   were composed by the order of Haroun er Rachid by the most celebrated
   physicians of his time, whom he had asked to inform him of the
   remedies for successfully combating the ills caused by coition.
   
     Eat slowly, if your food shall do you good,
     And take good care, that it be well digested.
     Beware of things which want hard mastication;
     They are bad nourishment, so keep from them.
     Drink not directly after finishing your meal,
     Or else you go halfway to meet an illness.
     Keep not within you what is of excess,
     And if you were in most susceptible circles,
     Attend to this well before seeking your bed,
     For rest this is the first necessity.
     From medicines and drugs keep well away,
     And do not use them unless very ill.
     Use all precautions proper, for they keep
     Your body sound, and are the best support.
     Don't be too eager for round-breasted women;
     Excess of pleasure soon will make you feeble,
     And in coition you may find a sickness;
     And then you find too late that in coition
     Our spring of life runs into woman's vulva.
     And before all beware of aged women,
     For their embraces will to you be poison.
     Each second day a bath should wash you clean;
     Remember these precepts and follow them.
     
   Those were the rules given by the sages to the master of benevolence
   and goodness, to the generous of the generous.
   
   All sages and physicians agree in saying that the ills which afflict
   man originate with the abuse of coition. The man therefore who wishes
   to preserve his health, and particularly his sight, and who wants to
   lead a pleasant life, will indulge with moderation in love's
   pleasures, aware that the greatest evils may spring therefrom.

                                      
CHAPTER 8

  The Sundry Names Given to the Sexual Parts of Man
  
   KNOW, O Vizir (to whom God be good!), that man's member bears
   different names, as:
   
   El dekeur, the virile member El fortass, the bald one El kamera, the
   penis Abou aïne, he with one eye El aïr, the member for generation El
   atsar, the pusher El hamama, the pigeon El dommar, the odd-headed El
   teunnana, the tinkler Abou rokba, the one with a neck El heurmak, the
   indomitable Abou quetaïa, the hairy one El ahlil, the liberator El
   besiss, the impudent one El zeub, the verge El mostahi, the
   shame-faced one El hammache, the exciter El nâsse, the sleeper El
   bekkaï, the weeping one El zodamme, the crowbar El hezzaz, the
   rummager El khiade, the tailor El lezzaz, the unionist Mochefi el
   relil, the extinguisher of passion Abou lâaba, the expectorant El
   fattache, the searcher El khorrate, the turnabout El hakkak, the
   rubber El deukkak, the striker El mourekhi, the flabby one El âouame,
   the swimmer El motelâ, the ransacker El dekhal, the housebreaker El
   mokcheuf the discoverer El âouar, the one-eyed
   
   As regards the names of kamera and dekeur, their meaning is plain.
   Dekeur is a word which signifies the male of all creatures, and is
   also used in the sense of `mention' and `memory'. When a man has met
   with an accident to his member, when it has been amputated, or has
   become weak, and he can, in consequence, no longer fulfil his conjugal
   duties, they say of him: `the member of such an one is dead'; which
   means: the remembrance of him will be lost, and his generation is cut
   off by the root. When he dies they will say, `His member has been cut
   off,' meaning, `His memory is departed from the world.'
   
   The dekeur plays also an important part in dreams. The man who dreams
   that his member has been cut off is certain not to live long after
   that dream, for, as said above, it presages the loss of his memory and
   the extinction of his race.
   
   I shall treat this subject more particularly in the explication of
   dreams. The teeth (senane) represent years (senine); if therefore a
   man sees in a dream a fine set of teeth, this is for him the sign of
   along life.
   
   If he sees his nail (defeur) reversed or upside down, this is an
   indication that the victory (defeur) which he has gained over his
   enemies will change sides; and from a victor, he will become the
   vanquished; inversely, if he sees the nail of his enemy turned the
   wrong way, he can conclude that the victory which had been with his
   enemy will soon return to him.
   
   The sight of a lily (sonsana) is the prognostication of a misfortune
   which will last a year (son, misfortune; sena, year).
   
   The appearance of ostriches (nâmate) in dreams is of bad augury,
   because their name being formed of nâb and mate, signifies `news of
   death,' namely, peril.
   
   To dream of a shield (henafa) means the coming on of all sorts of
   misfortune, for this word, by a change of letters, gives koul afa,
   `all bad luck.'
   
   The sight of a fresh rose (ouarde) announces the arrival (ouroud) of a
   pleasure to make the heart tremble with joy; whilst a faded rose
   indicates deceitful news. It is the same with baldness of the temples,
   and similar things.
   
   The jessamine (yasmine) is formed of yas, signifying deception, or the
   happening of a thing contrary to your wish, and mine, which means
   untruth. The man, then, who sees a jessamine in his dream is to
   conclude that the deception, yas, in the name yasmine, is an untruth,
   and will thus be assured of the success of his enterprise. However,
   the prognostications furnished by the jessamine have not the same
   character of certainty as those given by the rose. It differs, in
   fact, greatly from this latter flower, inasmuch as the slightest
   breath of wind will upset it.
   
   The sight of a saucepan (beurma) announces the conclusion (anuberame)
   of affairs in which one is engaged. Abou Djahel (God's curse be upon
   him!) has added that such conclusion would take place during the
   night.
   
   A jar (khabia) is the sign of turpitude (khebets) in every kind of
   affair, unless it is one that has fallen into a pit or a river and got
   broken, so as to let escape all the calamities contained in it.
   
   The sawing of wood (nechara) means good news (bechara).
   
   The inkstand (douaïa) indicates the remedy (doua), namely, the cure of
   a malady, unless it be burnt, broken or lost, when it means the
   contrary.
   
   The turban (âmama) if seen to fall over the face and cover the eyes is
   a presage of blindness (âina), from which God preserve us!
   
   The finding again in good condition a gem that has been lost or
   forgotten is a sign of success.
   
   If one dreams that he gets out of a window (taga) he may know that he
   will come with advantage out of all transactions he may have, whether
   important or not. But if the window seen in the dream is narrow so
   that he had some trouble to get out of it, this will be to him a sign
   that in order to be successful he will have to make efforts in
   proportion to the difficulty experienced by him in getting out.
   
   The bitter orange signifies that from the place where it was seen
   calumnies will be issuing.
   
   Trees (achedjar) means discussions (mechadjera).
   
   The carrot (asefnaria) prognosticates misfortune (asef) and sorrow.
   
   The turnip (cufte) means for the man that has seen it a matter that is
   past and gone (ameur fate), so that there is no going back to it. The
   matter is weighty if it appeared large, of no importance if seen
   small; in short, important in proportion to the size of the turnip
   that has been seen.
   
   A musket seen without its being fired means a complot contrived in
   secret, and of no importance. But if it is seen going off it is a sign
   that the moment has arrived for the realisation of the complot.
   
   The sight of fire is of bad augury.
   
   If the pitcher (brik) of a man who has turned to God breaks, this is a
   sign that his repentance is in vain, but if the glass out of which he
   drinks wine breaks, this means that he returns to God.
   
   If you have dreamed of feasts and sumptuous banquets, be sure that
   quite contrary things will come to pass.
   
   If you have seen somebody bidding adieu to people on their going away
   you may be certain that it will be the latter who will shortly wish
   him a good journey; for the poet says:
   
     If you have seen your friend saying goodbye, rejoice;
     Let your soul be content as to him who is far away,
     For you may look forward to his speedy return,
     And the heart of him who said adieu will come back to you.
     
   The coriander (keusbeur) signifies that the vulva (keuss) is in proper
   condition.
   
   On this subject there is a story that the Sultan Haroun er Rachid,
   having with him several persons of mark with whom he was familiar,
   rose and left them to go to one of his wives, whom he wanted to enjoy.
   He found her suffering from her courses, and returned to his
   companions to sit down with them, resigned to his disappointment.
   
   Now it so happened that a moment afterwards the woman found herself
   free from her discharge. When she had assured herself of this, she
   made forthwith her ablutions, and sent to the Sultan, by one of her
   negresses, a plate of coriander.
   
   Haroun er Rachid was seated amongst his friends when the negress
   brought the plate to him. He took it and examined it, but did not
   understand the meaning of its being sent to him by his wife. At last
   he handed it to one of his poets, who, having looked at it
   attentively, recited to him the following verses:
   
     `She has sent you coriander
     White as sugar;
     I have placed it in my palm,
     And concentrated all my thoughts upon it,
     In order to find out its meaning;
     And I have seized it.
     O my master, what she wants to say,
     Is, "My vulva is restored to health."'
     
   Er Rachid was surprised at the wit shown by the woman, and at the
   poet's penetration. Thus that which was to remain a mystery remained
   hidden, and that which was to be known was divulged.
   
   A drawn sword is a sign of war, and the victory will remain with him
   who holds its hilt.
   
   A bridle means servitude and oppression.
   
   A long beard points to good fortune and prosperity; but it is said
   that it is a sign of death if it reaches down to the ground.
   
   Others pretend that the intelligence of each man is in an inverse
   proportion to the length of his beard; that is to say, a big beard
   denotes a small mind. A story goes in this respect, that a man who had
   a long beard saw one day a book with the following sentence inscribed
   on its back: `He whose chin is garnished with a large beard is as
   foolish as his beard is long.' Afraid of being taken for a fool by his
   acquaintances, he thought of getting rid of what there was too much
   of, and to this end, it being night-time, he grasped a handful of his
   beard close to the chin, and set the remainder on fire by the light of
   the lamp. The flame ran rapidly up the beard and reached his hand,
   which he had to withdraw precipitately on account of the heat. Thus
   his beard was burnt off entirely. Then he wrote on the back of the
   book, under the above-mentioned sentence, `These words are entirely
   true. I, who am now writing this, have proved their truth.' Being
   himself convinced that the weakness of the intellect is proportioned
   to the length of the beard.
   
   On the same subject it is related that Haroun er Rachid, being in a
   kiosk, saw a man with a long beard. He ordered the man to be brought
   before him, and when he was there he asked him, `What is your name?'
   
   `Abou Arouba,' replied the man.
   
   `What is your profession?'
   
   `I am a master in controversy.'
   
   Haroun then gave him the following case to solve. A man buys a
   he-goat, who, in voiding his excrements, hits the buyer's eye with
   part of it and injures the same. `Who has to pay for damages?' `The
   seller,' promptly says Abou Arouba. `And why?' asked the Caliph.
   `Because he has sold the animal without warning the buyer that it has
   a catapult in its anus,' answered the man. At these words the Caliph
   began to laugh immoderately, and recited the following verses:
   
     When the beard of the young man
     Has grown down to his navel,
     The shortness of his intellect is, in my eyes,
     Proportioned to the length his beard has grown.
     
   It is averred by many authors that amongst proper names there are such
   as bring luck, and others that bring ill luck, according to the
   meaning they bear.
   
   The names Ahmed, Mohammed, Hamdonna and Hamdoun indicate in encounters
   and in dreams the lucky issue arrived at in a transaction. Ali and
   Alia, indicate the height and elevation of rank. Naserouna, Naseur,
   Mansour and Naseur Allah signify triumph over enemies. Salem, Salema,
   Selim and Selimane indicate success in all affairs; also security for
   him who is in danger. Fetah Allah and Fetah indicate victory, like all
   the other names which in their meaning speak of lucky things. The
   names Râd and Râda signify thunder, tumult, and comprise everything in
   connection with this meaning. Abou el Feurdj and Ferendj indicate joy;
   Ranem and Renime success, Khalf Allah and Khaleuf compensation for a
   loss, and benediction. The sense of Abder Rassi, Hafid and Mahfond is
   favourable. The names in which are the words latif (benevolent),
   mourits (helpful), hanine (compassionate) and aziz (beloved), carry
   with them, in conformity with the sense of these words, the ideas of
   benevolence, lateuf (charity), iratsa (compassion), hanana, and aiz
   (favour). As an example of words of an unfavourable omen I will cite
   el ouar and el ouara, which imply the idea of difficulties.
   
   As supporting the truth of the preceding observations I will refer to
   this saying of the Prophet (the salutation and benevolence of God to
   him!), `Compare the names appearing in your dreams with their
   signification, so that you may draw therefrom your conclusions.'
   
   I must confess that this was not the place for treating of this
   subject, but one word leads on to more. I now return to the object of
   this chapter, viz: the different names of the sexual parts of man.
   
   The name of el aïr is derived from el kir (the smith's bellows). In
   fact if you turn in the latter word the k, kef, so that it faces the
   opposite way, you will find the word to read el aïr. The member is so
   called on account of its alternate swelling and subsiding again. If
   swollen up it stands erect, and if not it sinks down flaccid.
   
   It is called el hamama (the pigeon), because after having been swelled
   out it resembles at the moment when it returns to repose a pigeon
   sitting on her eggs.
   
   El teunnana (the tinkler) - So called because every time it enters or
   comes out of the vulva in coition it makes a noise.
   
   El heurmak (the indomitable) - It has received this name because when
   in a state of erection it begins to move its head, searching for the
   entrance to the vulva till it has found it, and it then walks in quite
   insolently, without asking leave.
   
   El ahlil (the liberator) - Thus called because in penetrating into the
   vulva of a woman thrice repudiated it gives her the liberty to return
   to her first husband.
   
   El zeub (the verge) - From the word deub, which means creeping. This
   name was given to the member because when it gets between a woman's
   thighs and feels a plump vulva it begins to creep upon the thighs and
   the Mount of Venus, then approaches the entrance of the vulva, and
   keeps creeping in until it is in possession and is comfortably lodged,
   and having it all its own way penetrates into the middle of the vulva,
   there to ejaculate.
   
   El hammache (the exciter) - It has received this name because it
   irritates the vulva by its frequent entries and exits.
   
   El nâasse (the sleeper) - From its deceitful appearance. When it gets
   into erection, it lengthens out and stiffens itself to such an extent
   that one might think it would never get soft again. But when it has
   left the vulva, after having satisfied its passion, it goes to sleep.
   
   There are members that fan asleep while inside the vulva, but the
   majority of them come out still firm but at that moment they get
   drowsy, and little by little they go to sleep.
   
   El zoddame (the crowbar) - It is called so because when it meets the
   vulva and the same will not let it pass in directly, it forces the
   entrance with its head, breaking and tearing everything, like a wild
   beast in the rutting season.
   
   El khiade (the tailor) - It takes this name from the circumstance that
   it does not enter the vulva until it has manoeuvred about the
   entrance, like a needle in the hand of a tailor, creeping and rubbing
   against it until it is sufficiently roused, after which it enters.
   
   Mochefi el relil (the extinguisher of passion) - This name is given to
   a member which is large, strong, and slow to ejaculate; such a member
   satisfies most completely the amorous wishes of a woman; for, after
   having wrought her up to the highest pitch, it allays her excitement
   better than any other. And, in the same way, it calms the ardour of
   the man. When it wants to get into the vulva, and arriving at the
   portal finds it closed, it laments, begs and promises: `Oh! my love!
   let me come in, I will not stay long.' And when it has been admitted,
   it breaks its word, and makes a long stay, and does not take its leave
   till it has satisfied its ardour by the ejaculation of the sperm,
   coming and going, tilting high and low, and rummaging right and left.
   The vulva protests, `How about your word, you deceiver?' she says;
   `you said you would only stop in for a moment.' And the member
   answers, `Oh, certainly! I shall not retire till I have encountered
   your womb; but after having found it, I will engage to withdraw at
   once.' At these words, the vulva takes pity on him, and advances her
   matrix, which clasps and kisses its head, as if saluting it. `The
   member then retires with its passion cooled down.
   
   El khorrate (the turnabout) - This name was given to it because on
   arriving at the vulva it pretends to come on important business,
   knocks at the door, turns about everywhere, without shame or
   bashfulness, investigating every corner to the right and left, forward
   and backward, and then all at once darts right to the bottom of the
   vagina for the ejaculation.
   
   El deukkak (the striker) - Thus called because on arriving at the
   entrance of the vulva it gives a slight knock. If the vulva opens the
   door, it enters; if there is no response, it begins to knock again,
   and does not cease until it is admitted. The parasite who wants to get
   into the house of a rich man to be present at a feast does the same:
   he knocks at the door; and if it is opened, he walks in; but if there
   is no response to his knock, he repeats it again and again until the
   door is opened. And similarly the deukkak with the door of the vulva.
   
   By `knocking at the door' is meant the friction of the member against
   the entrance of the vulva until the latter becomes moist. The
   appearance of this moisture is the phenomenon alluded to by the
   expression `opening the door.
   
   El âouame (the swimmer) - Because when it enters the vulva it does not
   remain in one favourite place, but, on the contrary, turns to the
   right, to the left, goes forward, draws back, and then moves like a
   swimmer in the middle amongst its own sperm and the fluid furnished by
   the vulva, as if in fear of drowning and trying to save itself.
   
   El dekhal (the housebreaker) - Merits that name because on coming to
   the door of the vulva this one asks, `What do you want?' `I want to
   come in!' `Impossible! I cannot take you in on account of your size.'
   Then the member insists that the other one should only receive its
   head, promising not to come in entirely; it then approaches, rubs its
   head twice or thrice between the vulva's lips, till they get humid and
   thus lubricated, then introduces first its head, and after, with one
   push, plunges in up to the testicles.
   
   El âouar (the one-eyed) - Because it has but one eye, which eye is not
   like other eyes, and does not see clearly.
   
   El fordyce (the bald one) - Because there is no hair on its head,
   which makes it look bald.
   
   Abou aïne (he with one eye) - It has received this name because it has
   one eye which presents the peculiarity of being without pupil and
   eyelashes.
   
   El âtsar (the stumbler) - It is called so because if it wants to
   penetrate into the vulva but does not see the door, it beats about
   above and below, bind thus continues to stumble as over stones in the
   road, until the lips of the vulva get humid, when it manages to get
   inside. The vulva then says, What has happened to you that made you
   stumble about so?' The member answers, `O my love, it was a stone
   lying in the road.'
   
   El dommar (the odd-headed) - Because its head is different from all
   ether heads.
   
   Abou rokba (the one with a neck) - That is the being with a short
   neck, a well-developed throat, thick at the end, and a bald head, and
   who, moreover, has coarse and bristly hair from the navel to the
   pubis.
   
   Abou quetaïa (the hairy one; who has a forest of hail) - This name is
   given to it when the hair is abundant about it.
   
   El besiss (the impudent one) - It has received this name because from
   the moment that it gets stiff and long it does not care for anybody,
   lifts impudently the clothing of its master by raising its head
   fiercely, and makes him ashamed while itself feels no shame. It acts
   in the same unabashed way with women, turning up their clothes and
   laying bare their thighs. Its master may blush at this conduct, but as
   to itself its stiffness and determination to plunge into a vulva only
   increase.
   
   El mostahi (the shame-faced one) - This sort of member which is met
   with sometimes, is capable of feeling ashamed and timid when facing a
   vulva which it does not know, and it is only after a little time that
   it gets bolder and stiffens. Sometimes it is even so much troubled
   that it remains incompetent for the coitus, which happens in
   particular when a stranger is present, in which case it becomes quite
   incapable of moving.
   
   El bekkaï (the weeper) - So called on account of the many tears it
   sheds: as soon as it gets m erection, it weeps; when it sees a pretty
   face, it weeps; handling a woman, it weeps. It goes even so far as to
   weep tears sacred to memory.
   
   El hezzaz (the rummager) - It is named thus because as soon as it
   penetrates into the vulva it begins to rummage about vigorously, until
   it has appeased its passion.
   
   El lezzaz (the unionist) - Received that name because as soon as it is
   in the vulva it pushes and works till fur meets fur, and even makes
   efforts to force the testicles into it.
   
   Abou lâaba (the expectorant) - Has received this name because when
   coming near a vulva, or when it sees one, or even when merely thinking
   of it, or when its master touches a woman or plays with her or kisses
   her, its saliva begins to move and it has tears in its eye; this
   saliva is particularly abundant when it has been for some time out of
   work, and it will even wet then his master's dress. This member is
   very common, and there are but few people who are not furnished with
   it.
   
   The liquid it sheds is cited by lawyers under the name of medi. Its
   production is the result of toyings and of lascivious thoughts. With
   some people it is so abundant as to fill the vulva, so that they
   erroneously believe that it comes from the woman.
   
   El fattache (the searcher) - From its habit, when in the vulva, of
   turning in every direction as if in search of something; and that
   something is the matrix. It will know no rest until it has found it.
   
   El hakkak (the rubber) - It has got this name because it will not
   enter the vagina until it has rubbed its head against the entrance and
   the lower part of the belly. It is frequently mistaken for the next
   one.
   
   El mourekhi (the flabby one) - This one can never get in because it is
   too soft, and it is therefore content to rub its head against the
   entrance to the vulva until it ejaculates. It gives no pleasure to
   woman, but only inflames her passion without being able to satisfy it,
   and makes cross and irritable.
   
   El motelâ (the ransacker) - So named because it penetrates into the
   unusual places, makes itself well acquainted with the state of vulvas,
   and can distinguish their qualities and faults.
   
   El mokcheuf (the discoverer) - Has been thus denominated because in
   getting up and raising its head, it raises the vestments which hide
   it, and uncovers its master's nudities, and because it is also not
   afraid to lay bare the vulvas which it does not yet know, and to lift
   up the clothes which cover them without shame. It is not accessible to
   any sense of bashfulness, cares for nothing and respects nothing.
   Nothing which concerns the coitus is strange to it; it has a profound
   knowledge of vulvas state of humidity, freshness, dryness, rightness
   or warmth of vulvas which it explores assiduously. There are, in fact,
   certain vulvas o exquisite exterior, plump and fine outside, whose
   insides leave much to wish for, and they give no pleasure, owing to
   their being not warm, but very humid, and having other similar faults.
   It is for this reason that the mokcheuf tries to find out about things
   concerning the coitus, and received this name.
   
   These are the principal names that have been given to the virile
   member according to its qualities. Those who think that the number of
   these names is not exhaustive can look for more; but I think I have
   given a nomenclature long enough to satisfy my readers.

   As regards the vulva called el feurdj, the slit, it has this name
   because it opens and shuts again when hotly yearning for coitus, like
   the one of a mare in heat at the approach of the stallion. This word,
   however, is applied indiscriminately to the natural parts of men and
   women, for God the Supreme has used this expression in the Koran,
   chap. xxxiii. v. 35, `El hafidine feuroudjahoum ou el hafidate.' The
   proper meaning of feurdj is slit, opening, passage; people say, `I
   have found a feurdj in the mountains,' viz., a passage; there is then
   a soukoune upon the ra and a fatcha upon the djïne, and in this sense
   it means also the natural parts of woman. But if the ra is marked with
   a fatcha it signifies deliverance from misfortunes.
   
   `The person who dreams of having seen the vulva, feurdj, of a woman
   will know that `if he isintrouble God will freehimof it; if he is in a
   perplexity he will soon get out of it; and lastly if he is in poverty
   he will soon become wealthy, because feurdj, by transposing the
   vowels, will mean the deliverance from evil. By analogy, if he wants a
   thing he will get it: if he has debts, they will be paid.'
   
   It is considered more lucky to dream of the vulva as open. But if the
   one seen belongs to a young virgin it indicates that the door of
   consolation will remain closed, and the thing which is desired is not
   obtainable. It is a proved fact that the man who sees in his dream the
   vulva of a virgin that has never been touched will certainly be
   involved in difficulties, and will not be lucky in his affairs. But if
   the vulva is open so that he can look well into it, or even if it is
   hidden but he is free to enter it, he will bring the most difficult
   tasks to a successful end after having first failed in them, and this
   after a short delay, by the help of a person whom he never thought of.
   
   He who has seen in his dream a man busy upon a young girl, and when
   the same is getting off her has managed to see at that moment her
   vulva, will bring his business to a happy end, after having first
   failed to do so, by the help of the man he has seen. If it is himself
   who did the girl's business, and he has seen her vulva, he will
   succeed by his own exertions to realize the most difficult problems,
   and be successful in every respect. Generally speaking, to see the
   vulva in dreams is a good sign; so it is of good augury to dream of
   coition, and he who sees himself in the act, and finishing with the
   ejaculation, will meet success in all his affairs. But it is not the
   same with the man who merely begins coition and does not finish it.
   He, on the contrary, will be unlucky in every enterprise.
   
   It is supposed that the man who dreams of being busy with a woman will
   afterwards obtain from her what he wants.
   
   The man who dreams of cohabiting with women with whom to have sexual
   intercourse is forbidden by religion, as for instance his mother,
   sister, etc. (maharine), must consider this as a presage that he will
   go to sacred places (moharreme); and, perhaps, even journey to the
   holy house of God, and look there upon the grave of the Prophet.
   
   As regards the virile member, it has been previously mentioned that to
   dream of accident occurring to that organ means the loss of all
   remembrance and the extinction of the race.
   
   The sight of a pair of pantaloons (seronal) prognosticates the
   appointment to a post (oulaïa), by reason of the analogy of the
   letters composing the word seronal with those arming by transposition
   the two words sir, go, and ouali, named: `Go to the post for which you
   are named.' It is related that a man who had dreamed that the Emir had
   given him a pair of pantaloons became Cadi. Dreaming of pantaloons is
   also a sign of protection for the natural parts, and foretells success
   in business.
   
   The almond (louze), a word composed of the same letters as zal, to
   cease, seen in a dream by a man in trouble means that he will be
   liberated from it; to a man who is ill, that he will be cured; in
   short that all misfortunes will give way. Somebody having dreamed that
   he was eating almonds, asked a wise man the meaning of it; he received
   the answer, that by reason of the analogy of the letters in louze and
   zal, the ills that beset him would disappear; and the event justified
   the explanation.
   
   The sight of a molar tooth (deurss) in a dream indicates eternity. The
   man, therefore, who has seen his tooth drop out may be sure that his
   enemy is dead. This arises from the word deurss, signifying both an
   enemy and a molar, and one can say at the same time, It is my tooth
   and it is my enemy.
   
   The window (taga) and the shoe (medassa) reminds you of women. The
   vulva resembles in fact, when invaded by the verge, a window with a
   man putting his head in to look about, or a shoe that is being put on.
   Consequently, he who sees himself in dreaming in the act of going in
   at a window, or putting on a shoe, has the certainty of getting
   possession of a young woman or a virgin, if the window is newly built,
   or the shoe new and in good condition; but that woman will be old
   according to the state of the window or shoe.
   
   The loss of a shoe foretells to a man the loss of his wife.
   
   To dream of something folded together, and which get:s open, predicts
   that a secret will be divulged and made public. The same remaining
   folded up indicates, on the other hand, that the secret will be kept
   
   If you dream of reading a letter you will know that you will have
   news, which will be, according to the nature of the contents of the
   letter, good or bad.
   
   The man who dreams of passages in the Koran or the Traditions, Hadits,
   will from the subjects treated therein draw his conclusions. For
   instance the passage, `He will grant you the help of God and immediate
   victory,' will signify to him victory and triumph. `Certainly he (God)
   has the decision in his hands', `Heaven will open and offer its
   numerous portals', and other similar passages, indicate success.
   
   A passage treating of punishments prognosticates punishment; from
   those treating of benefits a lucky event may be concluded. Such is the
   passage in the Koran, which says: `He who forgives sins is terrible in
   his inflictions.'
   
   Dreams about poetry and songs contain their explanation in the
   contents of the objects of the dream.
   
   He who dreams of horses, mules, or asses may hope for good, for the
   Prophet (God's salutation and goodness be with him!) has said, `Men's
   fortunes are attached to the forelocks of their horses till the day of
   resurrection!' and it is written in the Koran, `God the Highest has
   thus willed it that they serve you for mounts and for state.'
   
   The correctness of these prognostications is not subject to any doubt.
   
   He who dreams of seeing himself mounted upon an ass as a courier, and
   arriving at his destination, will be lucky in all things; but he who
   tumbles off the ass on his way is advised that he will be subject to
   accidents and misfortunes.
   
   The fall of the turban from the head predicts ignominy, the turban
   being the Arab's crown.
   
   If you see yourself in a dream with naked feet it means a loss; and
   the bare head has the same significance.
   
   By transposing the letters other analogies may be arrived at.
   
   These explanations are not here in their place; but I have been
   induced to give them in this chapter on account of the use to which
   they may be put. Persons who would wish to know more on this subject
   have only to consult the treatise of Ben Sirine. I now return to the
   names given to the sexual parts of woman.
   
   El keuss (the vulva) - This word serves as the name of a young woman's
   vulva in particular. Such a vulva is very plump and round in every
   direction, with long lips, grand slit, the edges well divided and
   symmetrical and rounded; it is soft, seductive, perfect throughout. It
   is the most pleasant and no doubt the best of all the different sorts.
   May God grant `is the possession of such a vulva! Amen. It is warm,
   tight, and dry; so much so that one might expect to see fire burst
   from it. Its form is graceful, its odour pleasant; the whiteness of
   its outside sets off its carmine-red middle. There is no imperfection
   about it.
   
   El kehmoune (the voluptuous) - The name given to the vulva of a young
   virgin.
   
   El ass (the primitive) - This is a name applicable to every kind of
   vulva.
   
   El zerzour (the starling) - The vulva of a very young girl, or, as
   others pretend, of a brunette.
   
   El cheukk (the chink) - The vulva of a bony, lean woman. It is like a
   chink in a wall, with not a vestige of flesh. May God keep us from it!
   
   Abou tertour (the crested one) - It is the name given to a vulva
   furnished with a red comb, like that of a cock, which rises at the
   moment of enjoyment.
   
   Abou khochime (the snub-nose) - Is a vulva with thin lips and a small
   tongue.
   
   El gueunfond (the hedgehog) - The vulva of the old, decrepit woman,
   dried up with age and with bristly hail.
   
   El sakouti (the silent one) - This name has been given to the vulva
   that is noiseless. The member may enter it a hundred times a day but
   it will not say a word, and will be content to look on without a
   murmur.
   
   El deukkak (the crusher) - So called from its crushing movements upon
   the member. It generally begins to push the member, directly it
   enters, to the right and to the left, and to grip it with the matrix,
   and would, if it could, absorb also the two testicles.
   
   El tseguil (the importunate) - This is the vulva which is never tired
   of taking in the member. This latter might pass a hundred nights with
   it, and walk in a hundred times every night, still that vulva would
   not be sated - nay, it would want still more, and would not allow the
   member to come out again at all, if it was possible. With such a vulva
   the parts are exchanged; the vulva is the pursuer, the member the
   pursued. Luckily it is a rarity, and only found in a small number of
   women, who are wild with passion, all on fire, and in flame.
   
   El taleb (the yearning one) - This vagina is met with in a few women
   only. With some it is natural; with others it becomes what it is by
   long abstinence. It is burning for a member, and, having got one in
   its embrace, it refuses to part with it until its fire is completely
   extinguished.
   
   El hacene (the beautiful) - This is the vulva which is white, plump,
   in form vaulted like a dome, firm, and without any deformity. You
   cannot take your eyes off it, and to look at it changes a feeble
   erection into a strong one.
   
   El neuffakh (the swelling one) - So called because a torpid member
   coming near it, and rubbing its head against it a few times, at once
   swells and stands upright. To the woman who has such a one it procures
   excessive pleasure, for, at the moment of the crisis, it opens and
   shuts convulsively, like the vulva of a mare.
   
   Abou djebaha (one with a projection) - Some women have this sort of
   vulva, which is very large, with a pubis prominent like a projecting,
   fleshy forehead.
   
   El ouasâ (the vast one) - A vulva surrounded by a very large pubis.
   Women of that build are said to be of large vagina, because, although
   on the approach of the member it appears find and impenetrable to such
   a degree that not even a meroud seems likely to be passed in, as soon
   as it feels the friction of the glans against its centre it opens wide
   at once.
   
   El aride (the large one) - This is the vulva which is as wide as it is
   long; that is to say, fully developed all round, from side to side,
   and from the pubis to the perineum. It is the most beautiful to look
   upon. As the poet said:
   
     It has the splendid whiteness of a forehead,
     In its dimensions it is like the moon,
     The fire that radiates from it is like the sun's,
     And seems to burn the member which approaches;
     Unless first moistened with saliva the member cannot enter,
     The odour it emits is full of charms.
     
   It is also said that this name applies to the vagina of women who are
   plump and fat. When such a one crosses her thighs one over the other
   the vulva stands out like the head of a calf. If she lays it bare it
   resembles a saâ for corn placed between her thighs; and, if she walks,
   it is apparent under her clothes by its wary movement at each step.
   May God, in his goodness and generosity, let us enjoy such a vagina!
   It is of all the most pleasing, the most celebrated, the most wished
   for.
   
   Abou Belâoum (the glutton) - The vulva with a vast capacity for
   swallowing. If such a vulva has not been able to get coitus for some
   time it fairly engulf the member that then comes near it, without
   leaving any trace of it outside, like as a man who is famished flings
   himself upon viands that are offered to him, and would swallow them
   without mastication.
   
   El mokâour (the bottomless) - This is the vagina of indefinite length,
   having, in consequence, the matrix lying very far back. It requires a
   member of the largest dimensions; any other could not succeed in
   rousing its amorous sensibilities.
   
   Abou cheufrine (the two-lipped) - This name is given to the amply
   developed vagina of an excessively stout woman. Also to the vagina the
   lips of which having become flaccid, owing to weakness, are long and
   pendulous.
   
   Abou âungra (the humpbacked) - This vulva has the mount of Venus
   prominent and hard, standing out like the hump on the back of the
   camel, and reaching down between the thighs like the head of a calf.
   May God let us enjoy such a vulva! Amen!
   
   El rorbal (the sieve) - This vulva on receiving a member seems to sift
   it all over, below, right and left, fore and aft, until the moment of
   pleasure arrives.
   
   El hezzaz (the restless) - When this vagina has received the member it
   begins to move violently and without interruption until the member
   touches the matrix, and then knows no repose till it has hastened on
   the enjoyment and finished its world.
   
   El lezzaz (the unionist) - The vagina which, having taken in the
   member, clings to it and pushes itself forward upon it so closely
   that, if the thing were possible, it would enfold the two testicles.
   
   El moudd (the accommodating) - This name is applied to the vagina of a
   woman who has felt for a long time an ardent wish for coition. In
   rapture with the member it sees, it is glad to second its movements of
   come and go; it offers its matrix to the member by pressing it forward
   within reach, which is, after all, the best gift it can offer.
   Whatever place inside of it the member wants to explore, this vulva
   will make him welcome to, gracefully according to its wish; there is
   no corner it will not help the member to reach.
   
   El mouâïne (the assistant) - This vulva is thus named because it
   assists the member to go in and out, to go up and down, in short, in
   all its movements, in such a way that if it desires to do a thing, to
   enter or to retire, to move about, etc., the vulva hastens to give it
   all facilities, and answers to its appeal. By this aid the ejaculation
   is facilitated, and the enjoyment heightened.
   
   El meusboul (the long one) - This name applies only to some vulvas;
   everyone knows that vulvas are far from being all of the same
   conformation and aspect This vulva extends from the pubis to the anus.
   It lengthens out when the woman is lying down or standing, and
   contracts when she is sitting, differing in this respect from the
   vulva of a round shape. It looks like a splendid cucumber lying
   between the thighs. With some women it shows projecting under light
   clothing, or when they are bending back.
   
   El molki (the duellist) - This is the vulva which, on the introduction
   of a member, executes the movement of coming and going, pushes itself
   upon it for fear of its retiring before the pleasure arrives. There is
   no enjoyment for it but the shock given to its matrix by the member,
   and it is for this that it projects its matrix to grip and suck the
   member's gland when the ejaculation takes place. Certain vulvas, wild
   with desire and lust, be it natural or a consequence of long
   abstention, throw themselves upon the approaching member, opening the
   mouth like a famished infant to whom the mother offers the breast. In
   the same way this vulva advances and retires upon the member to bring
   it face to face with the matrix, as if in fear that, unaided, it could
   not find the same.
   
   The vulva and the member resemble thus two skilful duellists, each
   time that one of them rushes its antagonist, the latter opposes its
   shield to parry the blow and repulse the assault. The member
   represents the sword, and the matrix the shield. The one who first
   ejaculates the sperm is vanquished; while the one who is slowest is
   the victor; and, assuredly, it is a fine fight! I should like thus to
   fight without stopping to the day of my death.
   
   As the poet says:
   
     I have let them see the effect of a subtle shadow,
     Spinning like an ever busy spider.
     They said to me, `How long will you go on?'
     I answered them, `I will work till I am dead.'
     
   El harrab (the fugitive) - The vagina which, being very tight and
   short, is hurt by the penetration of a very large and soft member; it
   tries to escape to the right and left. It is thus, people say, like
   the vagina of most virgins, which, not yet having made the
   acquaintance of the member and fearful of its approach, tries to get
   out of its way when it glides in between the thighs and wants to be
   admitted.
   
   El sabeur (the resigned) - This is the vulva which, having admitted
   the member, submits patiently to all its whims, and movements. It is
   also said that this vulva is strong enough to suffer resignedly the
   most violent and prolonged coitus. If it were assaulted a hundred
   times it would not be vexed or annoyed; and instead of venting
   reproaches, it would give thanks to God. It will show the same
   patience if it has to do with several members who visit it
   successively.
   
   This kind of vagina is found in women of a glowing temperament. If
   they only knew how to do it, they would not allow the man to dismount,
   nor his member to retire for a single moment.
   
   El mouseuffah (the barred one) - This kind of vagina is not often met
   with. The defect which distinguished it is sometimes natural,
   sometimes it is the result of an unskilfully executed operation of
   circumcision upon the woman. It can happen that the operator makes a
   false move with his instrument and injures the two lips, or even only
   one of them. In healing there forms a thick scar, which bars the
   passage, and in order to make the vagina accessible to the member, a
   surgical operation and the use of the bistouri will have to be
   resorted to.
   
   El merour (the deep one) - The vagina which always has the mouth open,
   and the bottom of which is beyond sight. The longest members only can
   reach it.
   
   El âddad (the biter) - The vulva which, when the member has got into
   it and is burning with passion, opens and shuts again upon the same
   fiercely. It is chiefly when the ejaculation is coming that the man
   feels the head of his member bitten by the mouth of the matrix. And
   certainly there is an attractive power in the same when it clings,
   yearning for sperm, to the gland, and draws it in as far as it can. If
   God in his power has decreed that the woman shall become pregnant the
   sperm gets concentrated in the matrix, where it is gradually vivified;
   but if, on the contrary, God does not permit the conception, the
   matrix expels the seed, which then runs over the vagina.
   
   El meusass (the sucker) - This is a vagina which in its amorous heat
   in consequence of voluptuous toyings, or of long abstinence, begins to
   suck the member which has entered it so forcibly as to deprive it of
   all its sperm, dealing with it as a child drawing on the breast of the
   mother.
   
   The poets have described it in the following verse:
   
     She - the woman shows in turning up her robe
     An object - the vulva - developed full and round,
     In semblance like a cup turned upside down.
     In placing thereupon your hand, you seem to feel
     A well-formed bosom, springy, firm, and full.
     In boring in your lance it gets well bitten,
     And drawn in by a suction, as the breast is by a child.
     And after having finished, if you wish to recommence,
     You'll find it flaming hot as any furnace.
     
   Another poet (may God grant all his wishes in Paradise!) has composed
   on the same theme the following lines:
   
     Like to a man extended on his chest, she - the vulva - fills the
     hand
     Which has to be well stretched to cover it.
     The place it occupies is standing forth
     Like an unopened bud of the blossom of a plum tree.
     Assuredly the smoothness of its skin
     Is like the beardless cheek of adolescence;
     Its conduit is but narrow,
     The entrance to it is not easy,
     And he who essays to get in
     Feels as though he was butting against a coat of mail.
     And at the introduction it emits a sound
     Like to the tearing of a woven stuff.
     The member having filled its cavity,
     Receives the lively welcome of a bite,
     Such as the nipple of the nurse receives
     When placed between the nursling's lips for suction.
     Its lips are burning,
     Like a fire that is lighted,
     And how sweet it is, this fire!
     How delicious for me.
     
   El zeunbour (the wasp) - This kind of vulva is known by the strength
   and roughness of its fur. When the member approaches and tries to
   enter it gets stung by the hairs as if by a wasp.
   
   El harr (the hot one) - This is one of the most praiseworthy vulvas.
   Warmth is in fact very much esteemed in a vulva, and it may be said
   that the intensity of the enjoyment afforded by it is in proportion to
   the heat it develops.
   
   Poets have praised it in the following verses:
   
     The vulva possesses an intrinsic heat;
     Shut in a solid heart (interior) and pent up breast (matrix).
     Its fire communicates itself to him that enters it;
     It equals in intensity the fire of love.
     She is as tight as a well-fitting shoe,
     Smaller than the circle of the apple of the eye.
     
   El ladid (the delicious) - It has the reputation of procuring an
   unexampled pleasure, comparable only to the one felt by the beasts and
   birds of prey, and for which they fight sanguinary combats. And if
   such effects are produced upon animals, what must they be for man? And
   so it is that all wars spring from the search for the voluptuous
   pleasure which the vagina procures, and which is the highest fortune
   of this world; it is a part of the delights of paradise awarded to us
   by God as a foretaste of what is waiting for us, namely, delights a
   thousand times superior, and above which only the sight of the
   Benevolent (God) is to be placed.
   
   More names might certainly be found applicable to the sexual organs of
   woman, but the number of those mentioned above appears to me ample.
   The principal object of this work is to collect together all the
   remarkable and attractive matters concerning coitus, so that he who is
   in trouble may find consolation in it, and the man to whom erection
   offers difficulties may be able to look into it for a remedy against
   his weakness. Wise physicians have written that people whose members
   have lost their strength, and are afflicted with impotence, should
   assiduously read books treating of coition, and study carefully the
   different kind of lovemaking, in order to recover their former vigour.
   A certain means of provoking erection is to look at animals in the act
   of coition. As it is not always everywhere possible to see animals
   whilst in the act of copulation, books on the subject of generation
   are indispensable. In every country, large or small, both the rich and
   poor have a taste for this sort of book, which may be compared to the
   stone of philosophy transforming common metals into gold.
   
   It is related (and God penetrates the most obscure matters, and is
   most wise!) that once upon a time, before the reign of the great
   Caliph Haroun er Rachid, there lived a buffoon, who was the amusement
   of women, old people and children. His name was Djoâidi. Many women
   granted him their favours freely, and he was much liked and well
   received by all. By princes, vizirs and caïds he was likewise very
   well treated; in general all the world pampered him; at that time,
   indeed, any man that was a buffoon enjoyed the greatest consideration,
   for which reason the poet has said:
   
     Oh, Time! Of all the dwellers here below
     You only elevate buffoons or fools,
     Or him whose mother was a prostitute,
     Or him whose anus as an inkstand serves,
     Or him who from his youth has been a pander;
     Who has no other work but to bring the two sexes together.
     
   Djoâidi related the following story:
   
    The History of Djoâidi and Fadehat el Djemal
    
   I was in love with a woman who was all grace and perfection, beautiful
   of shape, and gifted with all imaginable charms. Her cheeks were like
   roses, her forehead lily white, her lips like coral; she had teeth
   like pearls, and breasts like pomegranates. Her mouth opened round
   like a ring; her tongue seemed to be incrusted with precious gems; her
   eyes, black and finely slit, had the languor of slumber, and her voice
   the sweetness of sugar. With her form pleasantly filled out, her flesh
   was mellow like fresh butter, and pure as the diamond.
   
   As to her vulva, it was white, prominent, round as an arch; the centre
   of it was red, and breathed fire, without a trace of humidity; for,
   sweet :o the touch, it was quite dry. When she walked it showed in
   relief like a dome or an inverted cup. In reclining it was visible
   between her thighs, looking like a kid couched on a hillock.
   
   This woman was my neighbour. All the others played and laughed with
   me, jested with me, and met my suggestions with great pleasure. I
   revelled in their kisses, their close embraces and nibbling, and in
   sucking their lips, breasts, and necks. I had coition with all of
   them, except my neighbour, and it was exactly her I wanted to possess
   in preference to all the rest; but instead of being kind to me, she
   avoided me rather. When I contrived to take her aside to trifle with
   her and try to rouse her gaiety, and spoke to her of my desires, she
   recited to me the following verses, the sense of which was a mystery
   to me:
   
     Among the mountain tops I saw a tent placed firmly,
     Apparent to all eyes high up in mid-air.
     But, oh! the pole that held it up was gone.
     And like a vase without a handle it remained,
     With all its cords undone, its centre sinking in,
     Forming a hollow like that of a kettle.
     
   Every time I told her of my passion she answered me with these verses,
   which to me were void of meaning, and to which I could make no reply,
   which, however, only excited my love all the more. I therefore
   inquired of all those I knew - amongst wise men, philosophers, and
   savants - the meaning, but not one of them could solve the riddle for
   me, so as to satisfy my heat and appease my passion.
   
   Nevertheless I continued my investigations, until at last I heard of a
   savant named Abou Nouass, who lived in a far-off country, and who, I
   was told, was the only man capable of solving the enigma. I betook to
   him, apprised him of the distress I had with the woman, and recited to
   him the above-mentioned verses.
   
   Abou Nouass said to me, `This woman loves you to the exclusion of
   every other man. She is very corpulent and plump.' I answered, `It is
   exactly as you say. You have given her likeness as if she were before
   you, excepting what you say in respect of her love for me, for, until
   now, she has never given me any proof of it.'
   
   `She has no husband.'
   
   `This is so,' I said.
   
   Then he added, `I have reason to believe that your member is of small
   dimensions, and such a member cannot give her pleasure nor quench her
   fire; for what she wants is a lover with a member like that of an ass.
   Perhaps it may not be so. Tell me the truth about this!' When I had
   reassured him on that point, affirming that my member, which began to
   rise at the expression of his doubtings, was full-sized, he told me
   that in that case all difficulties would disappear, and explained to
   me the sense of the verses as follows:
   
   `The tent, firmly planted, represents the vulva of grand dimension and
   placed well forward, the mountains, between which it rises, are the
   thighs. The stake which supported its centre and has been torn up
   means that she has no husband, comparing the stake or pole that
   supports the tent to the virile member holding up the lips of the
   vulva. She is like a vase without a handle; this means if the pail is
   without a handle to hang it up by it is good for nothing, the pail
   representing the vulva, and the handle the verge. The cords are undone
   and its centre is sinking in; that is to say, as the tent without a
   supporting pole caves in at the centre, inferior in this respect to
   the vault which remains upright without support, so can the woman who
   has no husband not enjoy complete happiness. From the words, It forms
   a hollow like that of a kettle, you may judge how lascivious God has
   made that woman in her comparisons; she likens her vulva to a kettle,
   which serves to prepare the tserid. Listen; if the tserid is placed in
   the kettle, to turn out well it must be stirred by means of a
   medeleuk, long and solid, whilst the kettle is steadied by the feet
   and hands. Only in that way can it be properly prepared. It cannot be
   done with a small spoon; the cook would burn her hands, owing to the
   shortness of the handle, and the dish would not be well prepared. This
   is the symbol of this woman's nature, O Djoâidi. If your member has
   not the dimensions of a respectable medeleuk, serviceable for the good
   preparation of the tserid, it will not give her satisfaction, and,
   moreover, if you do not hold her close to your chest, enlacing her
   with your hands and feet, it is useless to solicit her favours;
   finally if you let her consume herself by her own fire, like the
   bottom of the kettle which gets burnt if the medeleuk is not stirred
   upon it, you will not gratis her desire by the result.
   
   `You see now what prevented her from acceding to your wishes; she was
   afraid that you would not be able to quench her flame after having
   fanned it.
   
   `But what is the name of this woman, O Djoâidi?'
   
   `Fadehat el Djemal' (the sunrise of beauty), I replied.
   
   `Return to her,' said the sage, `and take her these verses, and your
   affair will come to a happy issue, please God! You will then come back
   to me, and inform me of what will have come to pass between you two.'
   
   I gave my promise, and Abou Nouass recited to me the following lines:
   
     Have patience now, O Fadehat el Djemal,
     I understand your words, and all shall see howl obey them.
     O you! beloved and cherished by whoever
     Can revel in your charms and glory in them!
     O apple of my eye! You thought I was embarrassed
     About the answer which I had to give you
     Yes, certainly! It was the love I bore you
     Made me look foolish in the eyes of all you know.
     They thought I was possessed of a demon;
     Called me a Merry Andrew and buffoon.
     For God! What of buffoonery I've got,
     Should it be that
     No other member is like mine?
     Here! see it, measure it!
     What woman tastes it falls in love with me,
     In violent love. It is a well-known fact
     That you from far may see it like a column.
     If it erects itself it lifts my robe and shames me.
     Now take it kindly, put it in your tent,
     Which is between the well-known mountains placed.
     It will be quite at home there, you will find it
     Not softening while inside, but sticking like a nail;
     Take it to form a handle to your vase.
     Come and examine it, and notice well
     How vigorous it is and long in its erect:ion!
     If you but want a proper medeleuk,
     A medeleuk to use between your thighs,
     Take this to stir the centre of your kettle.
     It will do good to you, O mistress mine!
     Your kettle be it plated will be satisfied!
     
   Having learnt these verses by heart, I took my leave of Abou Nouass
   and returned to Fadehat el Djemal. She was, as usual, alone. I gave a
   slight knock at her door; she came out at once, beautiful as the
   rising sun, and coming up to me, she said, `Oh! enemy of God, what
   business has brought you here to me at this time?'
   
   I answered her, `O my mistress! a business of great importance.'
   
   `Explain yourself, and I will see whether I can help you,' she said.
   
   `I shall not speak to you about it until the door is locked,' I
   answered.
   
   `Your boldness today is very great,' she said.
   
   And I, `True, O my mistress! boldness is one of my qualities.'
   
   She then addressed me thus, `O enemy of yourself! O you most miserable
   of your race! If I were to lock the door, and you have nothing
   wherewith to satisfy my desires, what should I do with you? face of a
   Jew!'
   
   `You will let me share your couch, and grant me your favours.
   
   She began to laugh; and after we had entered the house, she told a
   slave to lock the house door. As usual, I asked her to respond to my
   proposals; she then recited to me again the above-mentioned verses.
   When she had finished I began to recite to her those which Abou Nouass
   had taught me.
   
   As I proceeded I saw her more and more moved, I observed her giving
   way to yawns, to stretch herself, to sigh. I knew now I should arrive
   at the desired result. When I had finished, my member was in such a
   state of erection that it became like a pillar, still lengthening.
   When Fadehat el Djemal saw it in that condition she precipitated
   herself upon it' took it into her hands, and drew it towards her
   thighs. I then said, `O apple of my eyes! this may not be done here,
   let us go into your chamber.'
   
   She replied, `Leave me alone, O son of a debauched woman! Before God!
   I am losing my senses in seeing your member getting longer and longer,
   and lifting your robe. Oh, what a member! I never saw a finer one! Let
   it penetrate into this delicious, plump vulva, which maddens all who
   hear it described; for the sake of which so many have died of love;
   and of which your superiors and masters themselves have not been able
   to get possession.'
   
   I repeated, `I shall not do it anywhere else than in your chamber.'
   
   She answered, `If you do not enter this minute this tender vulva, I
   shall die.'
   
   As I still insisted upon repairing to her room, she cried, `No, it is
   quite impossible; I cannot wait so long!'
   
   I saw in fact her lips tremble, her eyes filling with tears. A general
   tremor ran over her, she changed colour, and laid herself down upon
   her back, baring her thighs, the whiteness of which made her flesh
   appear like crystal tinged with carmine.
   
   Then I examined her vulva - a white cupola with a purple centre, soft
   and charming. It opened like that of a mare on the approach of a
   stallion.
   
   At that moment she seized my member and kissed it, saying, `By the
   religion of my father! it must penetrate into my vulva!' and drawing
   nearer to me she pulled it towards her vagina.
   
   I now hesitated no longer to assist her with my member, and placed it
   against the entrance to her vulva. As soon as the head of my member
   touched the lips, the whole body of Fadehat el Djemal trembled with
   excitement. Sighing and sobbing, she held me pressed to her bosom.
   
   Again I profited by this moment to admire the beauties of her vulva.
   It was magnificent, its purple centre setting off its whiteness all
   the more. It was round, and without any imperfection; projecting like
   a splendidly curved dome over her belly. In one word, it was a
   masterpiece of creation as fine as could be seen. The blessing of God,
   the best creator, upon it.
   
   And the woman who possessed this wonder had in her time no superior.
   
   Seeing her then in such transports, trembling like a bird, the throat
   of which is being cut, I pushed my dart into her. Thinking she might
   not be able to take in the whole of my member, I had entered
   cautiously, but she moved her buttocks furiously, saying to me, `This
   is not enough for my contentment.' Making a strong push, I lodged my
   member completely in her, which made her utter a painful cry, but the
   moment after she moved with greater fury than before. She cried, `Do
   not miss the comers, neither high nor low, but above all things do not
   neglect the centre! The centre!' she repeated. `If you feel it coming,
   let it go into my matrix so as to extinguish my fire.' Then we moved
   alternately in and out, which was delicious. Our legs were interlaced,
   our muscles unbent, and so we went on with kisses and claspings until
   the crisis came upon us simultaneously. We then rested and took breath
   after this mutual conflict.
   
   I wanted to withdraw my member, but she would not consent to this and
   begged of me not to take it out. I acceded to her wish, but a moment
   later she took it out herself, dried it, and replaced it in her vulva.
   We renewed our game, kissing, pressing, and moving in rhythm. After a
   short time, we rose and entered her chamber, without having this time
   accomplished the enjoyment. She gave me now a piece of an aromatic
   root, which she recommended me to keep in my mouth, assuring me that
   as long as I had it there my member would remain on the alert. Then
   she asked me to lie down, which I did. She mounted upon me, and taking
   my member into her hands, she made it enter entirely into her vagina.
   I was astonished at the vigour of her vulva and at the heat emitted
   from it. The opening of her matrix in particular excited my
   admiration. I never had any experience like it; it closely clasped my
   member and pinched the gland.
   
   With the exception of Fadehat el Djemal no woman had until then taken
   in my member to its full length. She was able to do so, I believe,
   owing to her being very plump and corpulent, and her vulva being large
   and deep.
   
   Fadehat el Djemal, astride upon me, began to rise and descend; she
   kept crying out, wept, went slower, then accelerated her movements
   again, ceased to move altogether; when part of my member became
   visible she looked at it' then took it out altogether to examine it
   closely, then plunged it in again until it had appeared completely. So
   she continued until the enjoyment overcame her again. At last, having
   dismounted from me, she now laid herself down, and asked me to get on
   to her. I did so, and she introduced my member entirely into her
   vulva.
   
   We thus continued our caresses, changing our positions in turns, until
   night came on. I thought it proper to show a wish to go now, but she
   would not agree to this, and I had to give her my word that I would
   remain. I said to myself. `This woman will not let me go at any price,
   but when daylight comes God will advise me.' I remained with her, and
   all night long we kept caressing each other, and took but scanty rest.
   
   I counted that during that day and night, I accomplished twenty-seven
   times the act of coitus, and I became afraid that I should nevermore
   be able to leave the house of that woman.
   
   Having at last made good my escape, I went to visit Abou Nouass again,
   and informed him of all that had happened. He was surprised and
   stupefied, and his first words were, `O Djoâidi, you can have neither
   authority nor power over such a woman, and she would make you do
   penance for all the pleasure you have had with other women!'
   
   However, Fadehat el Djemal proposed to me to become her legitimate
   husband, in order to put a stop to the vexatious rumours that were
   circulating about her conduct. I, on the other hand, was only on the
   look out for adultery. Asking the advice of Abou Nouass about it, he
   told me, `If you marry Fadehat el Djemal you will ruin your health,
   and God will withdraw his protection from you, and the worst of all
   will be that she will cuckold you, for she is insatiable with respect
   to the coitus, and would cover you with shame.' And I answered him,
   `Such is the nature of women; they are insatiable as far as their
   vulvas are concerned, and so long as their lust is satisfied they do
   not care whether it be with a buffoon, a negro, a valet, or even with
   a man that is despised and reprobated by society.'
   
   On this occasion Abou Nouass depicted the character of women in the
   following verses:
   
     Women are demons, and were born as such; No one can trust them, as
     is known to all; If they love a man, it is only out of caprice; And
     he to whom they are most cruel loves them most; Beings full of
     treachery and trickery, I aver The man that loves you truly is a
     lost man; He who believes me not can prove my word By letting
     woman's love get hold of him for years! If in your own generous
     mood you have given them Your all and everything for years and
     years, They will say afterwards, `I swear by God! my eyes Have
     never seen a thing he gave me!' After you have impoverished
     yourself for their sake, Their cry from day to day will be for
     ever, `Give! Give, man. Get up and buy and borrow.' If they cannot
     profit by you they'll turn against you; They will tell lies about
     you and calumniate you. They do not recoil to use a slave in the
     master's absence, If once their passions are aroused, and they play
     tricks; Assuredly, if once their vulva is in rut, They only think
     of getting in some member in erection. Preserve us, God! from
     woman's trickery; And of old women in particular. So be it.

                                      
CHAPTER 10

  Concerning the Organs of Generation of animals Know, O Vizir (God's blessing
  be with you!), that the sexual organs of the various male animals are not
  analogous with the different natures of the virile members which I have
  mentioned.
  
   The verges of animals are classed according to the species to which
   they belong, and these species are four in number.
   
   1. The verges of animals with hoofs, as the horse, mule, ass, which
   verges are of large size.
   
   El vermoul, the colossus Abou dommar, the one with a head El kass, the
   serpent rolled up Abou beurnita, the one with a hat El fellag, the
   splitter El keurkite, the pointed staff El zellate, the club El
   keuntra, the bridge El heurmak, the indomitable El rezama, the mallet
   El meunefoukh, the swollen Abou sella, the fighter
   
   2. The verges of animals which have the kind of feet called akhefaf
   as, for instance, the camel.
   
   El mâloum, the well-known El beurkal, the swinging one El tonil, the
   long one El mokheubbi, the hidden one El cherita, the riband El châaf
   the tuft El mostakime, the firm one Tsequil el ifaha, the slow-coach
   
   3. The verges of animals with split hoofs, like the ox, the sheep,
   etc.
   
   El aceub, the nerve Requig er ras, the small head El heurbadj, the rod
   El tonil, the long one El sonte, the whip El aïcoub, the nervous (for
   the ram)
   
   4. And lastly, the members of animals with claws, as the lion, fox,
   dog, and other animals of this species.
   
   El kedib, the verge El metemerole, the one that will lengthen El
   kibouss, the great gland
   
   It is believed that of all the animals of God's creation the lion is
   the most expert in respect to coition. If he meets the lioness he
   examines her before copulation. He will know if she has already been
   covered by a male. When she comes to him he smells at her, and if she
   has allowed herself to be crossed by a boar he knows it immediately by
   the odour that animal has left upon her. He then smells her urine, and
   if the examination proves unfavourable, he gets into a rage, and
   begins to lash with his tail right and left. Woe to the animal that
   comes at that time near him; it is certain to be torn to pieces. He
   then returns to the lioness, who, seeing that he knows all, trembles
   with terror. He smells again at her, utters a roar which makes the
   mountains shake, and, falling upon her, lacerates her back with his
   claws. He even will go so far as to kill her, and then befoul her body
   with his urine.
   
   It is said that the lion is the most jealous and most intelligent of
   all animals. It is also averred that he is generous, and spares him
   who gets round him by fair words.
   
   A man who on meeting a lion uncovers his sexual parts causes him to
   take to flight.
   
   Whoever pronounces before a lion the name of Daniel (hail be to him!)
   also sends him flying, because the prophet (hail be to him!) has
   enjoined this upon the lion in respect to the invocation of his name.
   Therefore, when this name is pronounced, the lion departs without
   doing any Ii arm. Several cases which prove this fact are cited.

                                      
CHAPTER 11

  On the Deceits and Treacheries of Women
  
   Know, O Vizir (to whom God be good!), that the stratagems of women are
   numerous and ingenious. Their tricks will deceive Satan himself, for
   God the Highest has said Koran, chapter xii, verse 28) that the
   deceptive faculties of women are great, and he has likewise said
   (Koran, chapter vi, verse 38) that the stratagems of Satan are weak.
   Comparing the word of God as to the ruses of Satan and woman,
   contained in those two verses, it is easy to see how great these
   latter ones are.
   
    Deceived Husband being Convicted Himself of Infidelity
    
   It is related that a man fell in love with a woman of great beauty,
   and possessing all perfections imaginable. He had made many advances
   to her, which were repulsed; then he had endeavoured to seduce her by
   rich presents, which were likewise declined. He lamented, complained,
   and was prodigal with his money in order to conquer her, but to no
   purpose. and he grew lean as a spectre.
   
   This lasted for some time, when he made the acquaintance of an old
   woman, whom he took into his confidence, complaining bitterly about
   it. She said to him, `I shall help you, please God.'
   
   Forthwith she made her way to the house of the woman, in order to get
   an interview with her; but on arriving there the neighbours told her
   that she could not get in, because the house was guarded by a
   ferocious bitch, who did not allow anyone to come in or to depart, and
   in her malignity always flew at the faces of people.
   
   Hearing this, the old woman rejoiced, and said to herself, `I shall
   succeed, please God.' She then went home, and filled a basket with
   bits of meat. Thus provided, she returned to the woman's house, and
   went in.
   
   The bitch, on seeing her, rose to spring at her; but she produced the
   basket with its contents, and showed it her. As soon as the brute saw
   the viands, it showed its satisfaction by the movements of its tail
   and nostrils. The old woman putting down the basket before it, spoke
   to it as follows, `Eat, O my sister. Your absence has been painful to
   me; I did not know what had become of you, and I have been looking for
   you a long time. Appease your hunger!'
   
   While the animal was eating, and she stroked its back, the mistress of
   the house came to see who was there, and was not a little surprised to
   see the bitch, which would never suffer anybody to come near her, so
   friendly with a strange person. She said, `O old woman, how is it that
   you know our dog?' The old woman gave no reply, but continued to
   caress the animal, and utter lamentations.
   
   Then said the mistress of the house to h, er, `My heart aches to see
   you thus. Tell me the cause of your sorrow.
   
   `This bitch,' said the woman, `was formerly a woman, and my best
   friend. One fine day she was invited with me to a wedding; she put on
   her best clothes, and adorned herself with her finest ornaments. We
   then went together. On our way we were accosted by a man, who at her
   sight was seized with the most violent love; but she would not listen
   to him. Then he offered brilliant presents, which she also declined.
   This man, meeting her some days later, said to her, "Surrender
   yourself to my passion, or else I shall conjure God to change you into
   a bitch." She answered, "Conjure as much as you like." The man then
   called the maledictions of heaven upon that woman, and she was changed
   into a bitch, as you see here.
   
   At these words the mistress of the house began to cry and lament,
   saying, `O my mother! I am afraid that I shaD meet the same fate as
   this bitch.' `Why what have you done?' said the old woman. The other
   answered, `There is a man who has loved me since a long time, and I
   have refused to accede to his desires, nor did I listen to him, though
   the saliva was dried up in his mouth by his supplications; and in
   spite of the large expenses he had gone to in order to gain my favour,
   I have always answered him that I should not consent; and now, O my
   mother, lam afraid that he might call to God to curse me.
   
   `Tell me how to know this man,' said the old woman, `for fear that you
   might become like this animal.'
   
   `But how will you he able to find him, and whom could I send to him?'
   
   The old woman answered, `Me, daughter of mine! I shall render you this
   service, and find him.'
   
   `Make haste, O my mother, and see him before he conjures God against
   me.'
   
   `I shall find him still this day,' answered the old woman, `and please
   God, you shall meet him tomorrow.'
   
   With this, the old woman took her leave, went on the same day to the
   man who had made her his confidant, and told him of the meeting
   arranged for next day.
   
   So the next day the mistress of the house went to the old woman, for
   they had agreed that the rendezvous should take place there. When she
   arrived at the house she waited for some time, but the lover did not
   come. No doubt he had been prevented from making his appearance by
   some matter of importance.
   
   The old woman, reflecting upon this mischance, thought to herself,
   `There is no might nor power but in God, the Great.' But she could not
   imagine what might have kept him away. Looking at the woman, she saw
   that she was agitated, and it was apparent that she wanted coition
   hotly. She got more and more restless, and presently asked, `Why does
   he not come?' The old woman made answer, `O my daughter, some serious
   affair must have interfered, probably necessitating a journey. But I
   shall help you under these circumstances.' She then put on her
   melahfa, and went to look for the young man. But it was to no
   purpose, as she could not find out anything about him.
   
   Still continuing her search, the old woman was thinking, `This woman
   is at this moment eagerly coveting a man. Why not try today another
   young man, who might calm her ardour? Tomorrow I shall find the right
   one.' As she was thus walking and thinking she met a young man of very
   pleasing exterior. She saw, at once, that he was a fit lover, and
   likely to help her out of her perplexity; and she spoke to him: `O my
   son, if I were to set you in connection with a lady, beautiful,
   graceful and perfect, would you make love to her?' `If your words are
   truth, I would give you this golden dinar!' said he. The old woman,
   quite enchanted, took the money, and conducted him to her house.
   
   Now, it so happened that this young man was the husband of the lady,
   which the old woman did not know till she had brought him. And the way
   she found it out was this: She went first into the house and said to
   the lady, `I have not been able to find the slightest trace of your
   lover; but, failing him, I hake brought you somebody to quench your
   fire for today. We will save the other for tomorrow. God has inspired
   me to do so.'
   
   The lady then went to the window to take a look at him whom the old
   woman wanted to bring to her, and, getting sight of him, she
   recognized her husband, just on the point of entering the house. She
   did not hesitate, but hastily donning her melahfa, she went straight
   to meet him, and striking him in the face, she exclaimed, `O! enemy of
   God and of yourself, what are you doing here? You surely came with the
   intention to commit adultery. I have been suspecting you for a long
   time, and waited here every day, while I was sending out the old woman
   to inveigle you to come in. This day I have found you out, and denial
   is of no use. And you always told me that you were not a rake! I shall
   demand a divorce this very day, now I know your conduct!'
   
   The husband, believing that his wife spoke the truth, remained silent
   and abashed.
   
   Learn from this the deceitfulness of woman, and what she is capable
   of.
   
    Story of the Lover against His Will
    
   A story is told of a certain woman who was desperately in love with
   one of her neighbours, whose virtue and piety were well known. She
   declared to him her passion; but, finding all her advances constantly
   repulsed, in spite of all her wiles, she resolved to have her
   satisfaction nevertheless, and this is the way she went to work her
   purpose:
   
   One evening she apprised her negress that she intended to set a snare
   for that man, and the negress, by her order, left the street door
   open; then, in the middle of the night, she called the negress and
   gave her the following instructions: `Go and knock with this stone at
   our street door as hard as you can, without taking any notice of the
   cries which I shall utter, or the noise I make; as soon as you hear
   the neighbour opening his door, come back and knock the same way at
   the inner door. Take care that he does not see you, and come in at
   once if you observe somebody coming.' The negress executed this order
   punctually.
   
   Now, the neighbour was by nature a compassionate man, always disposed
   to assist people in distress, and his help was never asked in vain. On
   hearing the noise of the blows struck at the door and the cries of his
   neighbour, he asked his wife what this might mean, and she replied,
   `It is our neighbour so and so, who is attacked in her house by
   thieves.' He went in great haste to her aid; but scarcely had he
   entered the house when the negress closed the door upon him. The woman
   seized him, and uttered loud screams. He protested, but the mistress
   of the house put, without any more ado, this condition before him. `If
   you do not consent to do with me so and so, I shall tell that you have
   come in here to violate me, and hence all this noise.' `The will of
   God be done!' said the man, `nobody can go against him, nor escape
   from His might.' He then tried sundry subterfuges in order to escape,
   but in vain, for the mistress of the house recommenced to scream and
   make a row, which brought a good many people to the spot. He saw that
   his reputation would be compromised if he continued his resistance,
   and surrendered, saying, `Save me, and I am ready to satisfy you!' `Go
   into this chamber and close the door behind you,' said the lady of the
   house, `if you want to leave this house with honour, and do not
   attempt escape unless you wish those people to know that you are the
   author of all this commotion.' When he saw how determined she was to
   have her way, he did as she had told him. She, on her part, went out
   to the neighbours that had come to help her, and giving them some kind
   of explanation, dismissed them. They went away condoling with her.
   
   Left alone, she shut the doors and returned to her unwilling lover.
   She kept him in X for a whole week, and only set him free after she
   had completely drained him.
   
   Learn from this the deceitfulness of women, and what they are capable
   of.
   
    A Larceny of Love
    
   The following story is told of two women who inhabited the same house.
   The husband of one of them had a member long, thick and hard; while
   the husband of the other had, on the contrary, that organ little,
   insignificant and soft. The first one rose always pleasant and
   smiling: the other one got up in the morning in tears and vexation.
   
   One day the two women were together, and spoke of their husbands.
   
   The first one said, `I live in the greatest happiness. My bed is a
   couch of bliss. When my husband and I are together in it it is the
   witness of our supreme pleasure; of our kisses and embraces, of our
   joys and amorous sighs. When my husband's member is in my vulva it
   stops it up completely; it stretches itself out until it touches the
   bottom of my vagina, and it does not take its leave until it has
   visited every corner - threshold, vestibule, ceiling and centre. When
   the crisis arrives it takes its position in the very centre of the
   vagina, which it floods with tears. It is in this way we quench our
   fire and appease our passion.'
   
   The second answered, `I live in the greatest grief our bed is a bed of
   misery, and our coition is a union of fatigue and trouble, of hate and
   malediction. When my husband's member enters my vulva there is a space
   left open, and it is so short it cannot touch the bottom. When it is
   in erection it is twisted all ways, and cannot procure any pleasure.
   Feeble and meagre, it can scarcely ejaculate a drop, and its service
   cannot afford pleasure to any woman.'
   
   Such was the almost daily conversation which the two women had
   together.
   
   It happened, however, that the woman who had so much cause for
   complaint thought in her heart how delightful it would be to commit
   adultery with the other one's husband. She thought to herself, `It
   must be brought about, if it be only for once.' Then she watched her
   opportunity until her husband had to be absent for a night from the
   house.
   
   In the evening she made preparation to get her project carried out,
   and perfumed herself with sweet scents and essences. When the night
   was advanced to about a third of its duration, she noiselessly entered
   the chamber in which the other woman and her husband were sleeping,
   and groped her way to their couch. Finding that there was a free space
   between them, she slipped in. There was scant room, but each of the
   spouses thought it was the pressure of the other, and gave way a
   little; and so she contrived to glide between them. She then quietly
   waited until the other woman was in a profound sleep, and then,
   approaching the husband, she brought her flesh in contact with his. He
   awoke, and smelling the perfumed odours which she exhaled, he was in
   erection at once. He drew her towards him, but she said, in a low
   voice, Let me go to sleep!' He answered, `Be quiet, and let me do! The
   children will not hear anything!' She then pressed close up to him, so
   as to get him farther away from his wife, and said, `Do as you like,
   but do not awaken the children, who are close by.' She took these
   precautions for fear that his wife should wake up.
   
   The man, however, roused by the odour of the perfumes, drew her
   ardently towards himself. She was plump and mellow, and her vulva
   projecting. He mounted upon her and said, `Take it' (the member) `in
   your hand, as usual!' She took it, and was astonished at its size and
   magnificence, then introduced it into her vulva.
   
   The man, however, observed that his member had been taken in entirely,
   which he had never been able to do with his wife. The woman, on her
   part, found that she had never received such a benefit from her
   husband.
   
   The man was quite surprised. He worked his will upon her a second and
   third time, but his astonishment only increased. At last he got off
   her, and stretched himself along her side.
   
   As soon as the woman found that he was asleep, she slipped out, left
   the chamber, and returned to her own.
   
   In the morning, the husband, on rising, said to his wife, `Your
   embraces have never seemed so sweet to me as last night, and I never
   breathed such sweet perfumes as those you exhaled.' `What embraces and
   what perfumes are you speaking of' asked the wife. `I have not a
   particle of perfume in the house.' She called him a storyteller, and
   assured him that he must have been dreaming. He then began to consider
   whether he might not have deceived himself, and agreed with his wife
   that he must actually have dreamed it all.
   
   Appreciate, after this, the deceitfulness of women, and what they are
   capable of.
   
    Story of the Woman with Two Husbands
    
   It is related that a man, after having lived for some time in a
   country to which he had gone, became desirous of getting married. He
   addressed himself to an old woman who had experience in such matters,
   asking her whether she could find him a wife, and she replied, `I can
   find you a girl gifted with great beauty, and perfect in shape and
   comeliness. She will surely suit you, for besides having these
   qualities, she is virtuous and pure. Only mark, her business occupies
   her all the day, but during the night she will be yours completely. It
   is for this reason she keeps herself reserved, as she apprehends that
   a husband might not agree to this.'
   
   The man replied, `This girl need not be afraid. I, too, am not at
   liberty during the day, and I only want her for the night.'
   
   He then asked her in marriage. The old woman brought her to him, and
   he liked her. From that time they lived together, observing the
   conditions under which they had come together.
   
   This man had an intimate friend whom he introduced to the old woman
   who had arranged his marriage according to the conditions mentioned,
   and which friend had requested the man to ask her to do him the same
   service. They went to the old woman and solicited her assistance in
   the matter. `This is a very easy matter,' she said. `I know a girl of
   great beauty, who will dissipate your heaviest troubles. Only the
   business she is carrying on keeps her at work all night, but she will
   be with your friend all day long.' `This shall be no hindrance,'
   replied the friend. She then brought the young girl to him. He was
   well pleased with her, and married her on the conditions agreed upon.
   
   But before long the two friends found out that the two wives which the
   old harridan had procured for them were only one woman.
   
   Appreciate, after this, the deceitfulness of women, and what they are
   capable of.
   
    Story of Bahia
    
   It is related that a married woman of the name of Bahia (splendid
   beauty) had a lover whose relations to her were soon a mystery to no
   one, for which reason she had to leave him. Her absence affected him
   to such a degree that he fell ill, because he could not see her.
   
   One day he went to see one of his friends, and said to him, `Oh, my
   brother! an ungovernable desire has seized me, and I can wait no more.
   Could you accompany me on a visit I am going to pay to Bahia, the
   well-beloved of my heart?' The friend declared himself willing.
   
   `The next day they mounted their horses; and after a journey of two
   days, they arrived near the place where Bahia dwelt. There they
   stopped. The lover said to his friend, `Go and see the people that
   live about here, and ask for their hospitality, but take good care not
   to divulge our intentions, and try in particular to find the
   servant-girl of Bahia, to whom you can say that I am here, and whom
   you will charge with the message to her mistress that I would like to
   see her.' He then described the servant-maid to him.
   
   `The friend went, met the servant, and told her all that was
   necessary. She went at once to Bahia, and repeated to her what she had
   been told.
   
   Bahia sent to the friend the message, `Inform him who sent you that
   the meeting will take place tonight, near such and such a tree, at
   such and such an hour.'
   
   Returning to the lover, the friend communicated to him the decision of
   Bahia about the rendezvous.
   
   At the hour that had been fixed, the two friends were near to the
   tree. They had not to wait long for Bahia. As soon as her lover saw
   her coming, he rushed to meet her, kissed her, pressed her to his
   heart, and they began to embrace and caress each other.
   
   The lover said to her, `O Bahia, is there no way to enable us to pass
   the night together without rousing the suspicions of your husband?'
   She answered, `Oh, before God! if it will give you pleasure, the means
   to contrive this are not wanting.' `Hasten,' said her lover, `to let
   me know how it may be done.' She then asked him, `Your friend here, is
   he devoted to you, and intelligent?' He answered, `Yes.' She then
   rose, took off her garments, and handed them to the friend, who gave
   her his, in which she then dressed herself; then she made the friend
   put on her clothes. The lover said, surprised, `What are you going to
   do?' `Be silent,' she answered, and addressing herself to the friend,
   she gave him the following explanations: `Go to my house and lie down
   in my bed. After a third part of the night is passed, my husband will
   come to you and ask you for the pot into which they milk the camels.
   You will then take up the vase, but you must keep it in your hands
   until he takes it from you. This is our usual way. Then he will go and
   return with the pot filled with milk, and say to you, "Here is the
   pot!" But you must not take it from him until he has repeated these
   words. Then take it out of his hands. or let him put it on the ground
   himself. After that, you will not see anything more of him till the
   morning. After the pot has been put on the ground, and my husband is
   gone, drink the third part of the milk, and replace the pot on the
   ground.'
   
   The friend went, observed all these recommendations, and when the
   husband returned with the pot full of milk he did not take it out of
   his hands until he had said twice, `Here is the pot!' Unfortunately he
   withdrew his hands `, hen the husband was going to set it down, the
   latter thinking the pot was being held, let it go, and the vase fell
   upon the ground and was broken. The husband, in the belief that he was
   speaking to his wife, exclaimed, `What have you been thinking of?' and
   beat him with a switch till it broke; then took another, and continued
   to batter him stroke on stroke enough to break his back The mother and
   sister of Bahia came running to the spot to tear her from his hands.
   He had fainted. Luckily they succeeded in getting the husband away.
   
   The mother of Bahia soon came back, and talked to him so long that he
   was fairly sick of her talk; but he could do nothing but be silent and
   weep. At last she finished, saying, `Have confidence in God, and obey
   your husband. As for your lover, he cannot come now to see and console
   you, but I will send your sister to keep you company.' And so she went
   away.
   
   She did send, indeed, the sister of Bahia, who began to console her
   and curse him who had beaten her. He felt his heart warming towards
   her, for he had seen that she was of resplendent beauty, endowed with
   all perfections, and like the full moon in the night. He placed his
   hand over her mouth, so as to prevent her from speaking, and said to
   her, `O, lady! I am not what you think. Your sister Bahia is at
   present with her lover, and I have run into danger to do her a
   service. Will you not take me under your protection? If you denounce
   me, your sister will be covered with shame; as for me, I have done my
   part, but the evil may fall back upon you!'
   
   The young girl then began to tremble like a leaf, in thinking of the
   consequences of her sister's doings, and then, beginning to laugh,
   surrendered herself to the friend who had proved himself so true. They
   passed the remainder of the night in bliss, kisses, embraces, and
   mutual enjoyment. He found her the best of the best. In her arms he
   forgot the beating he had received, and they did not cease to play,
   toy, and make love till daybreak.
   
   He then returned to his companion. Bahia asked him how he had fared,
   and he said to her, `Ask your sister. By my faith! she knows it all!
   Only know, that we have passed the night in mutual pleasures, kissing
   and enjoying ourselves until now.
   
   Then they changed clothes again, each one taking his own, and the
   friend told Bahia all the particulars of what had happened to him.
   
   Appreciate, after this, the deceitfulness of women, and what they are
   capable of.
   
    The Story of the Man Who Was an Expert in Stratagems, and Was Duped by a
    Woman
    
   A story is told of a man who had studied all the ruses and all the
   stratagems invented by women for the deception of men, and boasted
   that no woman could dupe him.
   
   A woman of great beauty, and full of charms, got to hear of his
   conceit. She, therefore, prepared for him in the medjélés a collation,
   in which several kinds of wine figured, and nothing was wanting in the
   way of rare and choice viands. Then she sent for him, and invited him
   to come and see her. As she was famed for her great beauty and the
   rare perfection of her person, she had roused his desires, and he made
   haste to avail himself of her invitation.
   
   She was dressed in her finest garments, and exhaled the choicest
   perfumes, and assuredly whoever had thus seen her would have been
   troubled in his mind. And thus, when he was admitted into her
   presence, he was fascinated by her charms, and plunged into admiration
   of her marvellous beauty.
   
   This woman, however, appeared to be preoccupied on account of her
   husband, and allowed it to be seen that she was afraid of his coming
   back from one minute to another. It must be mentioned that this
   husband was very proud, very jealous, and very violent, and would not
   have hesitated to shed the blood of anyone whom he would have found
   prowling about his house. What would he have done, and, with much more
   reason, to the man whom he might have found inside!
   
   While the lady and he who flattered himself that he should possess her
   were amusing themselves in the medjélés, a knock at the house-door
   filled the lover with fear and trouble, particularly when the lady
   cried, `This is my husband, who is returning.' All in a tremble, she
   hid him in the closet, which was in the room, shut the door upon him,
   and left the key in the medjélés; then she opened the house-door.
   
   Her husband, for it was he, saw, on entering, the wine and all the
   preparations that had been made. Surprised, he asked what this meant.
   `It means what you see,' she answered. `But for whom is all this?' he
   asked.
   
   `It is for my lover whom I have here.'
   
   `And where is he?'
   
   `In this closet,' she said, pointing with her finger to the place
   where the sufferer was confined.
   
   At these words the husband started. He rose and went to the closet,
   but found it locked. `Where is the key?' he said. She answered,
   `Here!' throwing it to him. But as he was putting it into the lock she
   burst out laughing uproariously. He turned towards her, and said,
   `What are you laughing at?' `I laugh,' she answered, `at the weakness
   of your judgment, and your want of reason and reflection. Oh, you man
   without sense. do you think that if I had in reality a lover, and had
   admitted him into this room, I should have told you that he was here
   and where he was hidden? That is certainly not likely. I had no other
   thought than to offer you a collation on your return, and wanted only
   to have a joke with you in doing as I did. If I had had a lover I
   should certainly not have made you my confidant.'
   
   The husband left the key in the lock of the closet without having
   turned it, returned to the table, and said, `True! I rose; but I have
   not the slightest doubt about the sincerity of your words.' Then they
   ate and drank together, and made love.
   
   The man in the closet had to stop there until the husband went out.
   Then the lady went to set him free, and found him quite undone and in
   a bad state. When he came out, after having escaped an imminent peril,
   she said to him, `Well, you wiseacre, who know so well the stratagems
   of women, of all those you know, is there one to equal this?' He made
   answer, `I am now convinced that your stratagems are countless.'
   
   Appreciate after this the deceits of women, and what they are capable
   of.
   
    Story of the Lover Who Was Surprised by the Unexpected Arrival of the
    Husband
    
   It is related that a woman who was married to a violent and brutal
   man, having her lover with her on the unexpected arrival of her
   husband, who was returning from a journey, had only just time to hide
   him under the bed. She was compelled to let him remain in this
   dangerous and unpleasant position, knowing of no expedient which might
   enable him to leave the house. In her restlessness she went to and
   fro, and having gone to the street door, one of her neighbours, a
   woman, saw that she was in trouble, and asked her the reason of it.
   She told her what had happened. The other then said, `Return into the
   house.I will charge myself with the safety of your lover, and I
   promise you that he shall come out unharmed.' Then the woman
   re-entered her house.
   
   Her neighbour was not long in joining her, and together they prepared
   the meal, and then they all sat down to eat and drink. The woman sat
   facing her husband, and the neighbour opposite the bed. The latter
   began to tell stories and anecdotes about the tricks of women; and the
   lover under the bed heard all that was going on.
   
   Pursuing her tales, the neighbour told the following One: `A married
   woman had a lover, whom she loved tenderly, and by whom she was
   equally loved. One day the lover came to see her in the absence of her
   husband. But the latter happened to return home unexpectedly just as
   they were together. The woman, knowing of no better place, hid her
   lover under the bed, then sat down by her husband, who was taking some
   refreshment, and joked and played with him. Amongst other playful
   games, she covered her husband's eyes with a napkin, and her lover
   took this opportunity to come out from under the bed and escape
   unobserved.'
   
   The wife understood at once how to profit by this tale; taking a
   napkin and covering the eyes of her husband with it, she said, `Then
   it was by means of this ruse that the lover was helped out of his
   dilemma.' And the lover, taking the opportunity, succeeded in making
   good his escape unobserved by the husband. Unconscious of what had
   happened this latter laughed at the story, and his merriment was still
   increased by the last words of his wife and by her action.
   
   Appreciate after this the deceitfulness of women, and what they are
   capable of.

                                      
CHAPTER 12

  Concerning Sundry Observations Useful to Know for Men and Women
  
   Know, O Vizir (to whom God be good!), that the information contained
   in this chapter is of the greatest utility, and it is only in this
   book that such can be found. Assuredly to know things is better than
   to be ignorant of them. knowledge may be bad, but ignorance is still
   more so.
   
   The knowledge in question concerns matters unknown to you, and
   relating to women.
   
   There was once a woman, named Moârbeda, who was considered to be the
   most knowing and wisest person of her time. She was a philosopher. One
   day various queries were put to her, and among them the following,
   which I shall give here, with her answers.
   
   `In what part of a woman's body does her mind reside?'
   
   `Between her thighs.'
   
   `And where her enjoyment?'
   
   `In the same place.'
   
   `And where the love of men and the hatred of them?'
   
   `In the vulva,' she said; adding, `To the man whom we love we give our
   vulva, and we refuse it to him we hate. We share our property with the
   man we love, and are content with whatever little he may be able to
   bring to us; if he has no fortune, we take him as he is. But, on the
   other hand. we keep at a distance him whom we hate, were he to offer
   us wealth and riches.'
   
   `Where, in a woman, are located knowledge, love and taste?'
   
   `In the eye, the heart, and the vulva.'
   
   When asked for explanations on this subject, she replied: `knowledge
   dwells in the eye, for it is the woman's eye that appreciates the
   beauty of form and of appearance. By the medium of this organ, love
   penetrates into the heart and dwells in it, and enslaves it. A woman
   in love pursues the object of her love, and lays snares for it. If she
   succeed, there will be an encounter between the beloved one and her
   vulva. The vulva tastes him and then knows his sweet or bitter
   flavour. It is, in fact, the vulva which knows how to distinguish, by
   tasting, the good from the bad.'
   
   `Which virile members are preferred by women? What women are most
   eager for coitus, and which are those who detest it? Which are the men
   preferred by women, and which are those whom they abominate?'
   
   She answered, `Not all women have the same conformation of vulva, and
   they also differ in their manner of making love, and in their love for
   and their aversion to things. The same disparities exist in men, both
   with regard to their organs and their tastes. A woman of plump form
   and with a shallow uterus will look out for a member which is both
   short and thick, which will completely fill her vagina, without
   touching the bottom of it; a long and large member would not suit her.
   A woman with a deep lying uterus, and consequently a long vagina, only
   yearns for a member which is long and thick and of ample proportions,
   and thus fills her vagina in its whole extension; she will despise the
   man with a small and slender member for he could never satisfy her in
   coition.
   
   `The following distinctions exist in the temperaments of women: the
   bilious, the melancholy, the sanguine, the phlegmatic, and the mixed.
   Those with a bilious or melancholy temperament are not much given to
   coitus, and like it only with men of the same disposition. Those who
   are sanguine or phlegmatic love coition to excess, and if they
   encounter a member, they would never let it leave their vulva if they
   could help it. With these also it is only men of their own temperament
   who can satisfy them, and if such a woman were married to a bilious or
   melancholy man, they would lead a sorry life together. As regards
   mixed temperaments, they exhibit neither a marked predilection for,
   nor aversion against coitus.
   
   `It has been observed that under all circumstances little women love
   coitus more and evince a stronger affection for the virile member than
   women of a large size. Only long and vigorous members suit them; in
   them they find the delight of their existence and of their couch.
   
   `There are also women who love the coitus only on the edge of their
   vulva, and when a man lying upon them wants to get his member into the
   vagina, they take it out with the hand and place its gland between the
   lips of the vulva.'
   
   I have every reason to believe that this is only the case with young
   girls or with women not used to men. I pray God to preserve us from
   such, or from women for whom it is a matter of impossibility to give
   themselves up to men.
   
   `There are women who will do their husband's behests, and will satisfy
   them and give them voluptuous pleasure by coition, only if compelled
   by blows and ill-treatment. Some people ascribe this conduct to the
   aversion they feel either against coition or against the husband; but
   this is not so; it is simply a question of temperament and character.
   
   `There are also women who do not care for coition because all their
   ideas turn upon the grandeurs, personal honours, ambitious hopes, or
   business cares of the world. With others this indifference springs, as
   it may be, from purity of the heart, or from jealousy, or from a
   pronounced tendency of their souls towards another world, or lastly
   from past violent sorrows. Furthermore, the pleasures which they feel
   in coition depend not alone upon the size of the member, but also upon
   the particular conformation of their own natural parts. Amongst those
   the vulva called from its form el mortebâ, the square one, and el
   mortafâ, the projecting, is remarkable. This vulva has the peculiarity
   of projecting all round when the woman is standing up and closes her
   thighs. It burns for the coitus, its slit is narrow, and it is also
   called el keulihimi, the pressed one. The woman who has such a one
   likes only large members, and they must not let her wait long for the
   crisis. But this is a general characteristic of women.
   
   `As to the desire of men for coition, I must say that they also are
   addicted to it more or less according to their different temperaments,
   five in number, like the women's, with the difference that the
   hankering of the woman after the member is stronger than that of the
   man after the vulva.'
   
   `What are the faults of women?'
   
   Moârbeda replied to this question, `The worst of women is she who
   immediately cries out aloud as soon as her husband wants to touch the
   smallest amount of her property for his necessities. In the same line
   stands she who divulges matters which her husband wants to be kept
   secret.'
   
   `Are there any more?' she is asked. She adds, `The woman of a jealous
   disposition and the woman who raises her voice so as to drown that of
   her husband; she who disseminates scandal; the woman that scowls; the
   one who is always burning to let men see her beauty, and cannot stay
   at home; and with respect to this last let me add that a woman who
   laughs much, and is constantly seen at the street door, may be taken
   to be an arrant prostitute.
   
   `Bad also are those women who mind people's affairs; those who are
   always complaining; those who steal things belonging to their
   husbands; those of a disagreeable and imperious temper; those who are
   not grateful for kindnesses received; those that will not share the
   conjugal couch, or who incommode their husbands by the uncomfortable
   positions they take in it; those who are inclined to deceit,
   treachery, calumny and ruse.
   
   Then there are still women who are unlucky in whatever they undertake;
   those who are always inclined to blame and censure; those who invite
   their husbands to fulfil their conjugal duty only when it is
   convenient for them; those that make noises in bed; and lastly those
   who are shameless, without intelligence, tattlers and curious.
   
   Here you have the worst specimens amongst women.'

                                      
CHAPTER 13

  Concerning the Causes of Enjoyment in the Act of Generation
  
   Know, O Vizir (to whom God be good!), that the causes which tend to
   develop the passion for coition are six in number: the fire of an
   ardent love, the superabundance of sperm, the proximity of the loved
   person whose possession is eagerly desired, the beauty of the face,
   exciting viands, and contact.
   
   Know also, that the causes of the pleasure in cohabitation, and the
   conditions of enjoyment are numerous, but that the principal and best
   ones are: the heat of the vulva; the narrowness, dryness, and sweet
   exhalation of the same. If any one of these conditions is absent,
   there is at the same time something wanting in the voluptuous
   enjoyment. But if the vagina unites the required qualifications, the
   enjoyment is complete. In fact, a moist vulva relaxes the nerves, a
   cold one robs the member of all its vigour, and bad exhalations from
   the vagina detract greatly from the pleasure, as is also the case if
   the latter is very wide.
   
   The acme of enjoyment, which is produced by the abundance and
   impetuous ejaculation of the sperm, depends upon one circumstance, and
   this is, that the vulva is furnished with a suction-pump (orifice of
   the uterus), which will clasp the virile member, and suck up the sperm
   with an irresistible force. The member once seized by the orifice, the
   lover is powerless to retain the sperm, for the orifice will not relax
   its hold until it has extracted every drop of the sperm, and certainly
   if the crisis arrives before this gripping of the gland takes place,
   the pleasure of the ejaculation will not be complete.
   
   Know that there are eight things which give strength to and favour the
   ejaculation. These are: bodily health, the absence of all care and
   worry, an unembarrassed mind, natural gaiety of spirit, good
   nourishment, wealth, the variety of the faces of women, and the
   variety of their complexions.
   
   If you wish to acquire strength for coitus, take fruit of the mastic
   tree (derou), pound them and macerate them with oil and honey; then
   drink of the liquid first thing in the morning: you will thus become
   vigorous for the coitus, and there will be abundance of sperm
   produced.
   
   The same result will be obtained by rubbing the virile member and the
   vulva with gall from the jackal. This rubbing stimulates those parts
   and increases their vigour.
   
   A savant of the name of Djelinouss has said: `He who feels that he is
   weak for coition should drink before going to bed a glassful of very
   thick honey and eat twenty almonds and one hundred grains of the pine
   tree. He must follow this regime for three days. He may also pound
   onion seed, sift it and mix it afterwards with honey, stirring the
   mixture well, and take of this mixture while still fasting.'
   
   A man who would wish to acquire vigour for coition may likewise melt
   down fat from the hump of a camel, and rub his member with it just
   before the act; it will then perform wonders, and the woman will
   praise it for its work.
   
   If you would make the enjoyment still more voluptuous, masticate a
   little cubeb-pepper or cardamom grains of the large species; put a
   certain quantity of it upon the head of your member, and then go to
   work This will procure for you, as well as for the woman, a matchless
   enjoyment. The ointment from the balm of Judea or of Mecca produces a
   similar effect.
   
   If you would make yourself very strong for the coitus, pound very
   carefully pyrether together with ginger, mix them while pounding with
   ointment of lilac, then rub with this compound your abdomen, the
   testicles, and the verge. This will make you ardent for coitus.
   
   You will likewise predispose yourself for cohabitation, sensibly
   increase the volume of your sperm, gain increased vigour for the
   action, and procure for yourself extraordinary erections, by eating of
   chrysocolla the size of a mustard grain. The excitement resulting from
   the use of this nostrum is unparalleled, and all your qualifications
   for coitus will be increased.
   
   If you wish the woman to be inspired with a great desire to cohabit
   with you, take a little of cubebs, pyrether, ginger and cinnamon,
   which you will have to masticate just before joining her; then moisten
   your member with your saliva and do her business for her. From that
   moment she will have such an affection for you that she can scarcely
   be a moment without you.
   
   The virile member, rubbed with ass's milk, will become uncommonly
   strong and vigorous.
   
   Green peas, boiled carefully with onions, and powdered with cinnamon,
   ginger and cardamoms, well pounded, create for the consumer
   considerable amorous passion and strength in coitus.

                                      
CHAPTER 14

  Description of the Uterus of Sterile Women, and Treatment of the Same
  
   Know, O Vizir (God be good to you!), that wise physicians have plunged
   into this sea of difficulties to very little purpose. Each one has
   looked at the matter from his own point of view, and in the end the
   question has been left in the dark.
   
   Amongst the causes which determine the sterility of women may be taken
   the obstruction of the uterus by clots of blood, the accumulation of
   water, the want of or defective sperm of the man, organic malformation
   of the parts of the latter, internal defects in the uterus, stagnation
   of the courses and the corruption of the menstrual fluid, and the
   habitual presence of wind in the uterus. Other savants attribute the
   sterility of women to the action of spirits and spells. Sterility is
   common in women who are very corpulent, so that their uterus gets
   compressed and cannot conceive, not being able to take up the sperm,
   especially if the husband's member is short and his testicles are very
   fat; in such a case the act of copulation can only be imperfectly
   completed.
   
   One of the remedies against sterility consists of the marrow from the
   hump of a camel, which the woman spreads on a piece of linen, and rubs
   her sexual parts with, after having been purified subsequently to her
   courses. To complete the cure, she takes some fruits of the plant
   called `jackal's grapes', squeezes the juice out of them into a vase,
   and then adds a little vinegar; of this medicine she drinks, fasting
   for seven days, during which time her husband will take care to have
   copulation with her.
   
   The woman may besides pound a small quantity of sesame grain and mix
   its juice with a bean's weight of sandarach powder; of this mixture
   she drinks during three days after her periods; she is then fit to
   receive her husband's embraces.
   
   The first of these beverages is to be taken separately, and in the
   first instance; after this the second, which will have a salutary
   effect, if so it pleases the Almighty God!
   
   There is still another remedy. A mixture is made of nitre, gall from a
   sheep or a cow, a small quantity of the plant named el meusk, and of
   the grains of that plant. The woman saturates a plug of soft wool with
   this mixture, and rubs her vulva with it after menstruation; she then
   receives the caresses of her husband, and, with the will of God the
   Highest, will become pregnant.

                                      
CHAPTER 15

  Concerning the Causes of Impotence in Men
  
   Know, O Vizir (God be good to you!), that there are men whose sperm is
   vitiated by the inborn coldness of their nature, by diseases of their
   organs, by purulent discharges, and by fevers. There are also men with
   the urinary canal in their verge deviating owing to a downward curve;
   the result of such conformation is that the seminal liquid cannot be
   ejected in a straight direction, but falls downwards.
   
   Other men have the member too short or too small to reach the neck of
   the matrix, or their bladder is ulcerated, or they are affected by
   other mixtures, which prevent them from coition.
   
   Finally, there are men who arrive quicker at the crisis than women, in
   consequence of which the two emissions are not simultaneous; there is
   in such cases no conception.
   
   All these circumstances serve to explain the absence of conception in
   women; but the principal cause of all is the shortness of the virile
   member.
   
   As another cause of impotence may be regarded the sudden transmission
   from hot to cold, and vice versa, and a great number of analogous
   reasons.
   
   Men whose impotence is due either to the corruption of their sperm
   owing to their cold nature, or to maladies of the organs, or to
   discharges or fevers and similar ills, or to their excessive
   promptness in ejaculation, can be cured. They should eat stimulant
   pastry containing honey, ginger, pyrether, syrup of vinegar,
   hellebore, garlic, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamoms, sparrows' tongues,
   Chinese cinnamon, long pepper, and other spices. They will be cured by
   using them.
   
   As to the other afflictions which we have indicated - the curvature of
   the urethra, the small dimensions of the virile member, ulcers on the
   bladder, and the other infirmities which are adverse to coition - God
   only can cure them.

                                      
CHAPTER 16

  Undoing of Aiguillettes (Impotence for a Time)
  
   Know, O Vizir (God be good to you!), that impotence arises from three
   causes:
   
   Firstly, from the tying of aiguillettes.
   
   Secondly, from a feeble and relaxed constitution.
   
   And thirdly, from too premature ejaculation.
   
   To cure the tying of aiguillettes you must take galanga, cinnamon from
   Mecca, cloves, Indian cachou, nutmeg, Indian cubebs, sparrowwort,
   cinnamon, Persian pepper, Indian thistle, cardamoms, pyrether, laurel
   seed, and gilly flowers. All these ingredients must be pounded
   together carefully, and one drinks of it as much as one can, morning
   and night, in broth, particularly in pigeon broth; fowl broth may,
   however, be substituted just as well. Water is to be drunk before and
   after taking It. The compound may likewise be taken with honey, which
   is the best method, and gives the best results.
   
   The man whose ejaculation is too precipitate must take nutmeg and
   incense (oliban) mixed together with honey.
   
   If the impotence arises from weakness, the following ingredients are
   to be taken in honey: viz., pyrether, nettleseed, a little spurge (or
   cevadille), ginger, cinnamon of Mecca, and cardamom. This preparation
   will cause the weakness to disappear and effect the cure, with the
   permission of God the Highest!
   
   I can warrant the efficacy of all these preparations, the virtue of
   which has been tested.
   
   The impossibility of performing the coitus, owing to the absence of
   stiffness in the member, is also due to other causes. It will happen,
   for instance, that a man with his verge in erection will find it
   getting flaccid just when he is on the point of introducing it between
   the thighs of the woman. He thinks this is impotence, while it is
   simply the result, may he, of an exaggerated respect for the woman,
   may be of a misplaced bashfulness, may be because one has observed
   something disagreeable, or on account of an unpleasant odour; finally,
   owing to a feeling of jealousy, inspired by the reflection that the
   woman is no longer a virgin, and has served the pleasures of other
   men.

                                      
CHAPTER 17

  Prescriptions for Increasing the Dimensions of Small Members and for Making
  Them Splendid
  
   Know, O Vizir (God be good to you!), that this chapter, which treats
   of the size of the virile member, is of the first importance both for
   men and women. For the men because from a good-sized and vigorous
   member there springs the affection and love of women; for the women,
   because it is by such members that their amorous passions are
   appeased, and the greatest pleasure is procured for them. This is
   evident from the fact that many men, solely by reason of their
   insignificant members, are, as far as coition is concerned, objects of
   aversion to women, who likewise entertain the same sentiment with
   regard to those whose members are soft, nerveless, and relaxed. Their
   whole happiness consists in the use of robust and strong members.
   
   A man, therefore, with a small member, who wants to make it grand or
   fortify it for the coitus, must rub it before copulation with tepid
   water, until it gets red and extended by the blood flowing into it, in
   consequence of the heat; he must then anoint it with a mixture of
   honey and ginger, rubbing it in sedulously. Then let him join the
   woman; he will procure for her such pleasure that she objects to him
   getting off her again.
   
   Another remedy consists in a compound made of a moderate quantity of
   pepper, lavender, galanga, and musk, reduced to powder, sifted, and
   mixed up with honey and preserved ginger. The member after having been
   first washed in warm water, is then vigorously rubbed with the
   mixture; it will then grow large and brawny, and afford to the woman a
   marvellous feeling of voluptuousness.
   
   A third remedy is the following: wash the member in water until it
   becomes red, and enters into erection. Then take a piece of soft
   leather, upon which spread hot pitch, and envelop the member with it.
   It will not be long before the member raises its head, trembling with
   passion. The leather is to be left on until the pitch grows cold, and
   the member is again in a state of repose. This operation, several
   times repeated, will have the effect of making the member strong and
   thick.
   
   A fourth remedy is based upon the use made of leeches, but only of
   such as live in water (sic), You put as many of them into a bottle as
   can be got in, and fill it up with oil Then expose the bottle to the
   sun, until the heat of the same has effected a complete mixture. With
   the fluid thus obtained the member is to be rubbed several consecutive
   days, and It will, by being thus treated, become of a good size and of
   full dimensions.
   
   For another procedure I will here note the use of an ass's member.
   Procure one and boil it, together with onions and a large quantity of
   corn. With this dish feed fowls, which you eat afterwards. One can
   also macerate the ass's verge in oil, and use the fluid thus obtained
   for anointing one's member, and drinking of it.
   
   Another way is to bruise leeches with oil, and rub the verge with this
   ointment; or, if it is preferred, the leeches may be put into a
   bottle, and, thus enclosed, buried in a warm dung-hill until they are
   dissolved into a coherent mass and form a sort of liniment, which is
   used for repeatedly anointing the member. The member is certain
   greatly to benefit by this.
   
   One may likewise take rosin and wax, mixed with tubipore, asphodel,
   and cobbler's glue, with which mixture rub the member, and the result
   will be that its dimensions will be enlarged.
   
   The efficacy of all these remedies is well known, and I have tested
   them.

                                      
CHAPTER 18

  Of Things that Take Away the Bad Smell from the Armpit and Sexual Parts of
  Women and Contract the Latter
  
   Know, O Vizir (God be good to you!), that bad exhalations from the
   vulva and from the armpits are, as is also a wide vagina, the greatest
   of evils.
   
   If a woman wants this bad odour to disappear she must pound red myrrh,
   then sift it, and knead this powder with myrtle-water, and rub her
   sexual parts with this wash. All disagreeable emanation will disappear
   from her vulva.
   
   Another remedy is obtained by pounding lavender, and kneading it
   afterwards with musk-rose water. Saturate a piece of woollen stuff
   with it, and rub the vulva with the same until it is hot. The bad
   smell will be removed by this.
   
   If a woman intends to contract her vagina, she has only to dissolve
   alum in water, and wash her sexual parts with the solution, which may
   be made still more efficacious by the addition of a little bark of the
   walnut tree, the latter substance being very astringent.
   
   Another remedy to be mentioned is the following, which is well known
   for its efficacy. Boil well in water carobs (locusts), freed from
   their kernels. and bark of the pomegranate tree. The woman takes a
   sits bath in the decoction thus obtained, which must be as hot as she
   can bear it; when the bath gets cold, it must be warmed and used
   again, and this immersion is to be repeated several times. The same
   result may be obtained by fumigating the vulva with cow-dung.
   
   To do away with the bad smell of the armpits, one takes antimony and
   mastic, which are to be pounded together, and put with water into an
   earthen vase. The mixture is then rubbed against the sides of the vase
   until it turns red; when it is ready for use, rub it into the armpits,
   and the bad smell will be removed. It must be used repeatedly, until a
   radical cure is effected.
   
   The same result may be arrived at by pounding together antimony
   (hadida) and mastic, setting the mixture afterwards on to a stove over
   a low fire, until it is of the consistency of bread, and rubbing the
   residue with a stone until the pellicle, which will have formed, is
   removed. Then rub it into the armpits, and you may be sure that the
   bad smell will soon be gone.

                                      
CHAPTER 19

  Instructions with Regard to Pregnancy and How the Gender of the Child That Is
  To Be Born May Be Known - that is to say, Knowledge of the Sex of the Foetus
  
   Know, O Vizir (God be good to you!), that the certain indications of
   pregnancy are the following: the dryness of the vulva immediately
   after coitus, the inclination to stretch herself, accesses of
   somnolency, heavy and profound sleep, the frequent contraction of the
   opening of the vulva to such an extent that not even a meroud could
   penetrate, the nipples of the breast becoming darker and, lastly, the
   most certain of all marks is the cessation of menstruation.
   
   If the woman remains always in good health from the time that her
   pregnancy is certain, if she preserves the good looks of her face and
   a clear complexion, if she does not become freckled, then it may be
   taken as a sign that the child will be a boy.
   
   The red colour of the nipples also points to a child of the male sex.
   The strong development of the breasts, and bleeding from the nose, if
   it comes from the right nostril, are signs of the same purport.
   
   The signs pointing to the conception of a child of the female sex are
   numerous. I will name them here: frequent indisposition during
   pregnancy, pale complexion, spots and freckles, pains in the matrIx,
   frequent nightmares, blackness of the nipples, a heavy feeling on the
   left side, nasal haemorrhage on the same side.
   
   If there is any doubt about the pregnancy, let the woman drink, on
   going to bed, honey-water, and if then she has a feeling of heaviness
   in the abdomen, it is a proof that she is with child. If the right
   side feels heavier than the left one, it will be a boy. If the breasts
   are swelling with milk, this is similarly a sign that the child she is
   bearing will be of the male sex.
   
   I have received this information from savants, and all the indications
   are positive and tested.

                                      
CHAPTER 20

  Forming the Conclusion of This Work and Treating of the Good Effect;' of the
  Deglutition of Eggs as Favourable to the Coitus
  
   Know, O Vizir (God be good to you!), that this chapter contains the
   most useful instructions - how to increase the intensity of the coitus
   - and that the latter part is profitable to read for an old man as
   well as for the man in his best years and for the young man.
   
   The Sheikh, who gives good advice to the creatures of God the Great!
   he the sage, the savant, the first of the men of his time, speaks as
   follows on this subject; listen then to his words:
   
   He who makes it a practice to eat every day fasting the yolks of eggs,
   without the white part, will find in this aliment an energetic
   stimulant towards coitus. The same is the case with the man who during
   three days eats of the same mixture with onions.
   
   He who boils asparagus and then fries them in fat, and then pours upon
   them the yolks of eggs with pounded condiments, and eats every day of
   this dish, will grow very strong for the coitus, and find in it a
   stimulant for his amorous desires.
   
   He who peels onions, puts them into a saucepan, with condiments and
   aromatic substances, and fries the mixture with oil and yolks of eggs,
   will acquire a surpassing and invaluable vigour for the coitus, if he
   will partake of this dish for several days.
   
   Camel's milk mixed with honey and taken regularly develops a vigour
   for copulation which is unaccountable and causes the virile member to
   be on the alert night and day.
   
   He who for several days makes his meals upon eggs boiled with myrrh,
   coarse cinnamon, and pepper, will find his vigour with respect to
   coition and erections greatly increased. He will have a feeling as
   though his member would never return to a state of repose.
   
   A man who wishes to copulate during a whole night, and whose desire,
   having come on suddenly, will not allow him to prepare himself and
   follow the regimen just mentioned, may have recourse to the following
   recipe. He must get a great number of eggs, so that he may eat to
   surfeit, and fry them with fresh fat and butter; when done he immerses
   them in honey, working the whole mass well together. He must then eat
   of them as much as possible with a little bread, and he may be certain
   that for the whole night his member will not give him any rest.
   
   On this subject the following verses have been composed:
   
     The member of Abou el Heïloukh has remained erect
     For thirty days without a break, because he did eat onions.
     Abou el Heïdja has deflowered in one night
     Once eighty virgins, and he did not eat or drink between,
     Because he'd surfeited himself first with chick-peas,
     And had drunk camel's milk with honey mixed.
     Mimoun, the negro, never ceased to spend his sperm while he
     For fifty days without a truce the game was working.
     How proud he was to finish such a task!
     For ten days more he worked it, not was he yet surfeited,
     But all this time he ate but yolk of eggs and bread.
     
   The deeds of Abou el Heïloukli, Abou el Heïdja and Mimoun, just cited,
   have been justly praised, and their history is truly marvellous. So I
   will make you acquainted with it, please God, and thus complete the
   signal services which this work is designed to render to humanity.
   
    The History of Zohra
    
   The Sheikh, the protector of religion (God, the Highest, be good to
   him!), records, that there lived once in remote antiquity an
   illustrious King, who had numerous armies and immense riches.
   
   This King had seven daughters remarkable for their beauty and
   perfections. These seven had been born one after another, without any
   male infant between them.
   
   The kings of the time wanted them in marriage, but they refused to be
   married. They wore men's clothing, rode on magnificent horses covered
   with gold-embroidered trappings, knew how to handle the sword and the
   spear, and bore men down in single combat. Each of them possessed a
   splendid palace with the servants and slaves necessary for such
   service, for the preparation of meat and drink, and other necessities
   of that kind.
   
   Whenever a marriage-offer for one of them was presented to the King,
   he never failed to consult with her about it; but they always
   answered, That shall never be.'
   
   Different conclusions were drawn from these refusals; some in a good
   sense, some in a bad one.
   
   For a long time no positive information could be gathered of the
   reasons for this conduct, and the daughters persevered in acting in
   the same manner until the death of their father. Then the oldest of
   them was called upon to succeed him, and received the oath of fidelity
   from all his subjects. This accession to the throne resounded through
   all the countries.
   
   The name of the eldest sister was Fouzel Djemal (the flower of
   (Beauty); the second was called Soltana el Agmar (the queen of moons);
   the third, Bediaat el Djemal (the incomparable in beauty); the fourth,
   Ouarda (the rose); the fifth, Mahmouda (the praiseworthy); the sixth,
   Kamela (the perfect); and, finally, the seventh, Zohra (the beauty).
   
   Zohra, the youngest, was at the same time the most intelligent and
   judicious.
   
   She was passionately fond of the chase, and one day as she was riding
   through the fields she met on her way a cavalier, who saluted her, and
   she returned his salute; she had some twenty men in her service with
   her. The cavalier thought it was the voice of a woman he had heard,
   but as Zohra's face was covered by a flap of her haik, he was not
   certain, and said to himself, `I would like to know whether this is a
   woman or a man. He asked one of the princess's servants, who
   dissipated his doubts. Approaching Zohra, he then conversed pleasantly
   with her till they made a halt for breakfast. He sat down near her to
   partake of the repast.
   
   Disappointing the hopes of the cavalier, the princess did not uncover
   her face, and, pleading that she was fasting, ate nothing. He could
   not help admiring secretly her hand, the gracefulness of her waist'
   and the amorous expression of her eyes. His heart was seized with a
   violent love.
   
   The following conversation took place between them:
   
   THE CAVALIER: Is your heart insensible for friendship?
   
   ZOHRA: It is not proper for a man to feel friendship for a woman; for
   if their hearts once incline towards each other, libidinous desires
   will soon invade them, and with Satan enticing them to do wrong, their
   fall is soon known by everyone.
   
   THE CAVALIER: It is not so, when the affection is true and their
   intercourse pure without infidelity or treachery.
   
   ZOHRA: If a woman gives way to the affection she feels for a man, she
   becomes an object of slander for the whole world, and of general
   contempt, whence nothing arises but trouble and regrets.
   
   THE CAVALIER: But our love will remain secret, and in this retired
   spot, which may serve us as our place of meeting, we shall have
   intercourse together unknown to all.
   
   ZOHRA: That may not be. Besides, it could not so easily be done, we
   should soon be suspected, and the eyes of the whole world would be
   turned upon us.
   
   THE CAVALIER: But love, love is the source of life. The happiness,
   that is, the meeting, the embraces, the caresses of lovers. The
   sacrifice of the fortune, and even of the life for your love.
   
   ZOHRA: These words are impregnated with love, and your smile is
   seductive; but you would do better to refrain from similar
   conversation.
   
   THE CAVALIER: Your word is emerald and your counsels are sincere. ut
   love has now taken root in my heart, and no one is able to tear it
   out. If you drive me from you I shall assuredly die.
   
   ZOHRA: For all that you must return to your place and I to mine. If it
   pleases God we shall meet again.
   
   They then separated, bidding each other adieu, and returned each of
   them to their dwelling.
   
   The cavalier's name was Abou el Heïdja. His father, Kheiroun, was a
   great merchant and immensely rich, whose habitation stood isolated
   beyond the estate of the princess, a day's journey distant from her
   castle. Abou el Heïdja returned home, could not rest, and put on again
   his temeur when the night fell, took a black turban, and buckled his
   sword on under his temeur. Then he mounted his horse, and, accompanied
   by his favourite negro, Mimoun, he rode away secretly under the cover
   of night.
   
   They travelled all night without stopping until, on the approach of
   daylight, the dawn came upon them in sight of Zohra's castle. They
   then made a halt among the hills, and entered with their horses into a
   cavern which they found there.
   
   Abou el Heïdja left the negro in charge of the horses, and went in the
   direction of the castle, in order to examine its approaches; he found
   it surrounded by a very high wall. Not being able to get into it, he
   retired to some distance to watch those who came out. But the whole
   day passed away and he saw no one come out.
   
   After sunset he sat himself down at the entrance of the cavern and
   kept on the watch until midnight; then sleep overcame him.
   
   He was lying asleep with his head on Mimoun's knee, when the latter
   suddenly awakened him. `What is it?' he asked. `O my master,' said
   Mimoun, `I have heard some noise in the cavern, and I saw the glimmer
   of a light.' He rose at once, and looking attentively, he perceived
   indeed a light, towards which he went, and which guided him to a
   recess in the cavern. Having ordered the negro to wait for him while
   he was going to find out where it proceeded from, he took his sabre
   and penetrated deeper into the cavern. He discovered a subterranean
   vault, into which he descended.
   
   The road to it was nearly impracticable, on account of the stones
   which encumbered it. He contrived, however, after much trouble to
   reach a kind of crevice, through which the light shone which he had
   perceived. Looking through it, he saw the Princess Zohra, surrounded
   by about a hundred virgins. They were in a magnificent palace dug out
   in the heart of the mountain, splendidly furnished and resplendent
   with gold everywhere. The maidens were eatIng and drinking and
   enjoying the pleasures of the table.
   
   Abou el Heïdja said to himself, `Alas! I have no companion to assist
   me at this difficult moment.' Under the influence of this reflection,
   he returned to his servant, Mimoun, and said to him, `Go to my brother
   before God, Abou el Heïloukh, and tell him to come here to me as
   quickly as he can.' The servant forthwith mounted upon his horse, and
   rode through the remainder of the night.
   
   Of all his friends, Abou el Heïloukh was the one whom Abou el Heïdja
   liked best; he was the son of the Vizir. This young man and Abou el
   Heïdja and the negro, Mimoun, passed as the three strongest and most
   fearless men of their time, and no one ever succeeded in overcoming
   them in combat.
   
   When the negro Mimoun came to his master's friend, and had told him
   what had happened, the latter said, `Certainly, we belong to God and
   shall return to him.' Then he took his sabre, mounted his horse, and
   taking his favourite negro with him, he made his way, with Mimoun, to
   the cavern.
   
   Aboul el Heïdja came out to meet him and bid him welcome, and having
   informed him of the love he bore to Zohra, he told him of his
   resolution to penetrate forcibly into the palace, of the circumstances
   under which he had taken refuge in the cavern, and the marvellous
   scene he had witnessed while there. Abou el Heïloukh was dumb with
   surprise.
   
   At nightfall they heard singing, boisterous laughter, and animated
   talking. Abou el Heïdja said to his friend, `Go to the end of the
   subterranean passage and look. You will then make excuse for the love
   of your brother.' Abou el Heïloukh, stealing softly down to the lower
   end of the grotto, looked into the interior of the palace, and was
   enchanted with the sight of these virgins and their charms. `O
   brother,' he asked, `which among these women is Zohra?'
   
   Abou el Heïdja answered, `The one with the irreproachable shape, whose
   smile is irresistible, whose cheeks are roses, and whose forehead is
   resplendently white, whose head is encircled by a crown of pearls, and
   whose garments sparkle with gold. She is seated on a throne encrusted
   with rare stones and nails of silver, and she is leaning her head upon
   her hind.'
   
   `I have observed her of all the others,' said Abou el Heïloukh, as
   though she were a standard or a blazing torch. `But, O my brother, let
   me draw your attention to a matter which appears not to have struck
   you.' `What is it?' asked Abou el Heïdja. His friend replied, `It is
   very certain, O my brother, that licentiousness reigns in this palace.
   Observe that these people come here only at night-time, and that this
   is a retired place. There is every reason to believe that it is
   exclusively consecrated to feasting, drinking, and debauchery, and if
   it was your idea that you could have come to her you love by any other
   way than the one on which we are now, you would have found that you
   had deceived yourself, even if you had found means to communicate with
   her by the help or other people.' `And why so?' asked Abou el Heïdja.
   `Because,' said his friend, `as far as I can see, Zohra solicits the
   affection of young girls, which is a proof that she can have no
   inclination for men, nor be responsive to their love.'
   
   `O Abou el Heïloukh,' said Abou el Heïdja, `I know the value of your
   judgment, and it is for that I have sent for you. You know that I have
   never hesitated to follow your advice and counsel!' `O my brother,'
   said the son of the Vizir, `if God had not guided you to this entrance
   of the palace you would never have been able to approach Zohra. But
   from here, please God we can find our way.'
   
   Next morning at sunrise, they ordered their servants to make a breach
   in that place, and managed to get everything out of the way that could
   obstruct the passage. This done they hid their horses in another
   cavern, safe from wild beasts and thieves; then all the four, the two
   masters and the two servants, entered the cavern and penetrated into
   the palace, each of them armed with sabre and buckler. They then
   closed up again the breach, and restored its former appearance.
   
   Now they found themselves in darkness, but Abou el Heïloukh, having
   struck a match, lighted one of the candles, and they began to explore
   the palace in every sense. It seemed to them the marvel of marvels.
   The furniture was magnificent. Everywhere there were beds and couches
   of all kinds, rich candelabra, splendid lustres, sumptuous carpets,
   and tables covered with dishes, fruits and beverages.
   
   When they had admired all these treasures, they went on examining the
   chambers, counting them. There was a great number of them, and in the
   last one they found a secret door, very small, and of appearance which
   attracted their attention. Abou el Heïloukh said, `This is very
   probably the door which communicates with the palace. Come, O my
   brother, we will await the things that are to come in one of these
   chambers.' They took their position in a cabinet difficult of access,
   high up, and from which one could see without being seen.
   
   So they waited till night came on. At that moment the secret door
   opened, giving admission to a negress carrying a torch, who set alight
   all the lustres and candelabra, arranged the beds, set the plates,
   placed all sorts of meats upon the tables, with cups and bottles, and
   perfumed the air with the sweetest scents.
   
   Soon afterwards the maidens made their appearance. Their gait denoted
   at the same time indifference and languor. They seated themselves upon
   the divans, and the negress offered them meat and drink. They ate,
   drank, and sang melodiously.
   
   `Then the four men, seeing them giddy with wine, came down from their
   hiding place with their sabres in their hands, brandishing them over
   the heads of the maidens. They had first taken care to veil their
   faces with the upper part of their haïk.
   
   `Who are these men,' cried Zohra, `who are invading our dwelling under
   cover of the shades of the night? Have you risen out of the ground, or
   did you descend from the sky? What do you want?'
   
   `Coition!' they answered.
   
   `With whom?' asked Zohra.
   
   `With you, O apple of my eye!' said Abou el Heïdja, advancing.
   
   Zohra: `Who are you?'
   
   `I am Abou el Heïdja.'
   
   Zohra: `But how is it you know me?'
   
   `It is I who met you while out hunting at such and such a place.'
   
   Zohra: `But what brought you hither?'
   
   `The will of God the Highest!'
   
   At this answer Zohra was silent, and set herself to think of a means
   by which she could rid herself of these intruders.
   
   Now among the virgins that were present there were several whose
   vulvas were like iron barred, and whom no one had been able to
   deflower; there was also present a woman called Mouna (she who
   appeases the passion), who was insatiable as regards coition. Zohra
   thought to herself, `It is only by a stratagem I can get rid of these
   men. By means of these women I will set them tasks which they will be
   unable to accomplish as conditions for my consent.' Then turning to
   Abou el Heïdja, she said to him, `You will not get possession of me
   unless you fulfil the conditions which I shall impose upon you.' The
   four cavaliers at once consented to this without knowing them, and she
   continued, `But, if you do not fulfil them, will you pledge your word
   that you will be my prisoners, and place yourselves entirely at my
   disposition?' `We pledge our words!' they answered.
   
   She made them take their oath that they would be faithful to their
   word, and then, placing her hand in that of Abou el Heïdja, she said
   to him, `As regards you, I impose upon you the task of deflowering
   eighty virgins without ejaculating. Such is my will!' He answered, `I
   accept.'
   
   She let him then enter a chamber where there were several kinds of
   beds, and sent to him the eighty virgins in succession. Abou el Heïdja
   deflowered them all, and so ravished in a single night the maidenhood
   of eighty young girls without ejaculating the smallest drop of sperm.
   This extraordinary vigour filled Zohra with astonishment, and likewise
   all those who were present.
   
   The princess, turning then to the negro Mimoun, asked, `And this one,
   what is his name?' They said, `Mimoun.' `Your task shall be,' said the
   princess, pointing to Mouna, `to do this woman's business without
   resting for fifty consecutive days; you need not ejaculate unless you
   like; but if the excess of fatigue forces you to stop, you will not
   have fulfilled your obligations.' They all cried out at the hardness
   of such a task; but Mimoun protested, and said, `I accept the
   condition, and shall come out of it with honour!' The fact was that
   this negro had an insatiable appetite for the coitus. Zohra told him
   to go with Mouna to her chamber, impressing upon the latter to let her
   know if the negro should exhibit the slightest trace of fatigue.
   
   `And you, what is your name?' she asked the friend of Abou el Heïdja.
   `Abou el Heïloukh,' he replied. `Well, then, Abou el Heïloukh, what I
   require of you is to remain here, in the presence of these women and
   virgins, for fifty consecutive days with your member during this
   period always in erection during day and night.'
   
   Then she said to the fourth, `What is your name?'
   
   `Felah' (good fortune), was his answer. `Very well, Felah,' she said,
   `you will remain at our disposition for any services which we may have
   to demand of you.'
   
   However, Zohra, in order to leave no motive for any excuse, and so
   that she might not be accused of bad faith, had asked them, first of
   all, what regimen they wished to follow during the period of their
   trial. Aboul el Heïdja had asked for only one drink - excepting water
   - camel's milk with honey, and, for nourishment, chick-peas cooked
   with meat and abundance of onions; and, by means of these aliments he
   did, by the permission of God, accomplish his remarkable exploit. Abou
   el Heïloukh demanded, for his nourishment, onions cooked with meat,
   and, for drink, the juice pressed out of pounded onions mixed with
   honey. Mimoun, on his part, asked for yolks of eggs and bread.
   
   However, Abou el Heïdja claimed of Zohra the favour of copulating with
   her on the strength of the fact that he had fulfilled his engagement.
   She answered him, `Oh, impossible! the condition which you have
   fulfilled is inseparable from those which your companions have to
   comply with. The agreement must be carried out in its entirety, and
   you will find me true to my promise. But if one amongst you should
   fail in his task, you will all be my prisoners by the will of God!'
   
   Abou el Heïdja gave way in the face of this firm resolve, and sat down
   amongst the girls and women, and ate and drank with them, whilst
   waiting for the conclusion of the tasks of his companions.
   
   At first Zohra, feeling convinced that they would soon all be at her
   mercy, was all amiability and smiles. But when the twentieth day had
   come she began to show signs of distress; and on the thirtieth she
   could no longer restrain her tears. For on that day Abou el Heïloukh
   had finished his task, and, having come out of it honourably, he took
   his seat by the side of his friend amongst the company, who continued
   to eat tranquilly and to drink abundantly.
   
   From that time the princess, who had now no other hope than in the
   failure of the negro Mimoun, relied upon his becoming fatigued before
   he finished his work. She sent every day to Mouna for information, who
   sent word that the negro's vigour was constantly increasing, and she
   began to despair, seeing already Abou el Heïdja and Abou el Heïloukh
   coming off as victors in their enterprises. One day she said to the
   two friends, `I have made inquiries about the negro, and Mouna has let
   me know that he is exhausted with fatigue.' At these words Abou el
   Heïdja cried, `In the name of God! if he does not carry out his task,
   aye, and if he does not go beyond it for ten days longer, he shall die
   the vilest of deaths!'
   
   But his zealous servant never during the period of fifty days took any
   rest in his work of copulation, and kept going on, besides, for ten
   days longer, as ordered by his master. Mouna, on her part, had the
   greatest satisfaction, as this feat had at last appeased her ardour
   for coition. Mimoun, having remained victor, could then take his seat
   with his companions.
   
   Then said Abou el Heïdja to Zohra. `See, we have fulfilled all the
   conditions you have imposed upon us. It is now for you to accord me
   the favours which, according to our agreement, were to be the price if
   we succeeded.' `it is but too true!' answered the princess, and she
   gave herself up to him, and he found her excelling the most excellent.
   
   As to the negro, Mimoun, he married Mouna. Abou el Heïloukh chose,
   amongst all the virgins, the one whom he had found most attractive.
   
   They all remained in the palace, giving themselves up to good cheer
   and all possible pleasures, until death put an end to their happy
   existence and dissolved their union. God be merciful to them as well
   as to all Mussulmans! Amen!
   
   It is to this stop that the verses cited previously make allusion. I
   have given it here, because it testifies to the efficacy of the dishes
   and remedies, the use of which I have recommended, for giving vigour
   for coition, and all learned men agree in acknowledging their salutary
   effects.
   
   There are still other beverages of excellent virtue. I will describe
   the following: Take one part of the juice pressed out of pounded
   onions, and mix it with two parts of purified honey. Heat the mixture
   over a fire until the onion juice has disappeared and the honey only
   remains. Then take the residue front the fire, let it get cool, and
   preserve it for use when wanted. Then mix of the same one aoukia with
   three aouak of water, and let chick-peas be macerated in this fluid
   for one day and one night.
   
   This beverage is to be partaken of during winter and on going to bed.
   Only a small quantity is to be taken, and only for one day. The member
   or him who has drunk of it will not give him much rest during the
   night that follows. As to the man who partakes of it for several
   consecutive days, he will constantly have his member rigid and upright
   without intermission. A man with an ardent temperament ought not to
   make use of it, as it may give him a fever. Nor should the medicine be
   used three days in succession except by old or cold-tempered men. And
   lastly, it should not be resorted to in summer.
   
     I certainly did wrong to put this book together;
     But you will pardon me, nor let me pray in vain,
     O God! award no punishment for this on judgment day!
     And thou, oh reader, hear me conjure thee to say:
     
                                 So be it!

   
APPENDIX TO THE AUTOGRAPH EDITION

  To the Reader
  
   IN THE YEAR OF GRACE 1876 some amateurs who were passionately fond of
   Arabian literature combined for the purpose of reproducing, by
   autographic process, a number of copies of a French translation of a
   work written by the Sheikh Nefzaoui, which book had, by a lucky
   chance, fallen into their hands. Each brought to the undertaking such
   assistance as his special knowledge allowed, and it was thus that a
   tedious work was achieved by amateurs, amidst obstacles which were
   calculated to abate the ardour of their enthusiasm.
   
   Thus, as the reader has doubtless already divined, it was not an
   individual, but a concourse of individuals, who, taking advantage of a
   union of favourable circumstances and facilities, not of common
   occurrence, offered to their friends the first fruit of a work,
   interesting, and of such rarity that to the present time very few have
   had the opportunity of reading it, while they could only gather their
   knowledge from incorrect manuscripts, unsophisticated copies, and
   incomplete translations! It is to this association of efforts, guided
   by the principle of the division of labour for the earring out of a
   great undertaking, that the appearance of this book is due.
   
   The Editor (it is under this name that the Society J.M.P.Q. has been,
   is, and will be designated) is assured beforehand, notwithstanding the
   imperfection of his production, of the sympathies of his readers, who
   are all friends of his, or friends of his friends, and for whose
   benefit he has worked. For this reason he is not going to claim an
   indulgence which has been already extended to him; his wish is only to
   make clear to everybody the exact value and nature of the book which
   he is offering, and to make known on what foundations the work has
   been done, in how far the remarkable translation of M- has been
   respected, and, in short, what reliance may be placed in the title,
   `Translated from the Arabic by M-, Staff Officer'.
   
   It is, in fact, important that there should be no misunderstanding on
   this point, and that the reader should not imagine that he holds an
   exact copy of that translation in his hands; for we confess that we
   have modified it, and we give these explanations in order to justify
   the alterations which were imposed by the attending circumstances.
   
   As far as we are aware, there have been made until now only two proper
   translations of the work of the Sheikh Nefaaoui. One, of which we have
   availed ourselves, is due, as is well known, to M-, a fanatical and
   distinguished Arabophile; the other is the work of Doctor L-; the
   latter we have never seen.
   
   A learned expounder commenced a translation which promised to leave
   the others far behind. Unfortunately, death interrupted the
   accomplishment of this work, and there was no one to continue it.
   
   Our intention, at the outset, was to reproduce simply the first of the
   aforenamed translations, making, however, such rectifications as were
   necessitated by gross mistakes in the orthography, and in the French
   idiom, by which the manuscript in our possession was disfigured. Our
   views did not go beyond that; but we had scarcely made any progress
   with the book when we found that it was impossible to keep to the
   translation as it stood. Obvious omissions, mistaken renderings of the
   sense, originating, no doubt, with the faulty Arab text which the
   translator had at his disposal, and which were patent at first sight,
   imposed upon us the necessity of consulting other resources. We were
   thus induced to examine all the Arab manuscripts of the work which we
   could by any possibility obtain.
   
   Three texts were to this end put under contribution. These treated of
   the same subjects in the same order, and presented the same succession
   of chapters, corresponding, however, in this respect, point by point,
   with the manuscript upon which our translator had to work; but while
   two of them gave a kind of abstract of the questions treated, the
   third, on the contrary, seemed to enlarge at pleasure upon every
   subject.
   
   We shall expatiate to some slight extent upon this last-named text,
   since the study of it has enabled us to clear up a certain number of
   points upon which M-, notwithstanding his conscientious researches,
   has been unable to throw sufficient light.
   
   The principal characteristic of this text, which is not exempt from
   gross mistakes, is the affectation of more care as to style and choice
   of expressions; it enters more into fastidious and frequently
   technical particulars. contains more quotations of verses - often, be
   it remarked inapplicable ones - and uses, in certain circumstances,
   filthy images, which seem to have had a particular attraction for the
   author; but as a compensation for these faults, it gives, instead of
   cold, dry explications, pictures which are often charming, wanting
   neither in poetry nor originality, nor in descriptive talent, nor even
   in a certain elevation of thought, and bearing an undeniable stamp of
   originality. We may cite as an example the `Chapter on Kisses', which
   is found neither in our translation nor in the other two texts which
   we have examined, and which we have borrowed.
   
   In our character as Gauls, we must not complain about the obscenities
   which are scattered about, as if on purpose to excite the grosser
   passions; but what we must deprecate are the tedious expansions, whole
   pages full of verbiage, which disfigure the work, and are like the
   reverse of the medal. The author has felt this himself, as at the
   conclusion of his work he requests the reader to pardon him in
   consideration of the good intention which has guided his pen. In
   presence of the qualities of first rank which must be acknowledged to
   exist in the book, we should have preferred that it had not contained
   these defects; we should have liked, in one word, to see it more
   homogeneous and more earnest; and more particularly so if one
   considers that the circumstances which we are pointing out raise
   doubts as to the veritable origin of the new matters which have been
   discovered, and which might easily be taken for interpolations due to
   the fancy of one or more of the copyists through whose hands the work
   passed before we received it.
   
   Everyone knows, in fact, the grave inconveniences attaching to
   manuscripts, and the services rendered by the art of printing to
   science and literature by disposing of them. No copy leaves the hands
   of the copyist complete and perfect, particularly if the writer is an
   Arab, the least scrupulous of all. The Arab copyist not only
   involuntarily scatters about mistakes is which are due to his
   ignorance and carelessness, but will not shrink from making
   corrections, modifications, and even additions, according to his
   fancy. The literary reader himself, carried away by the charm of the
   subject, often annotates the text in the margin, inserts an anecdote
   or idea which is just current, or some puffed-up medical recipe; and
   all this, to the great detriment of its purity, finds its way into the
   body of the work through the hands of the next copyist.
   
   There can be no doubt that the work of the Sheikh Nefzaoui has
   suffered in this way. Our three texts and the one upon which the
   translator worked. offer striking dissimilarities, and of all kinds;
   although, by the way, one of the translations seems to approach more
   nearly in style to the extended text of which we have spoken. But a
   question of another sort comes before us with respect to this last,
   which contains more than four times as much matter as the others. Is
   this the entire work of the Sheikh Nefzaoui, always bearing in mind
   the modification to which manuscripts are exposed, and does it so
   stand by itself as a work for the perusal of voluptuaries, while the
   others are only abridged copies for the use of the vulgar, serving
   them as an elementary treatise? Or might it not be the product of
   numerous successive additions to the original work, by which, as we
   have already suggested, its bulk has been considerably increased.
   
   We have no hesitation in pronouncing in favour of the first of these
   hypotheses. In the record which the Sheikh gives of it, he says that
   this is the second work of the kind which he has composed, and that it
   is in fact only the first one, entitled the Torch of the World
   considerably increased pursuance of the advice given him by the Vizir
   Mohamed Ouana ez Zouaoui. Might it not be possible that a third work,
   still more complete than the second, had been the outcome of new
   studies of the author? Subjects of a particular speciality have
   certainly been treated in the work of which we speak. In looking at
   the Notes which serve as a preface to this translation, we find
   reproaches addressed by the translator to the author, because he has
   merely hinted at two questions of more than ordinary interest, viz.,
   tribady and paederasty. Well, then, the Sheikh would meet his critic
   triumphantly by appearing before him with the work in question, for
   the chapter which constitutes by itself more than half of its whole
   volume is the twenty-first, and bears the superscription: `The
   twenty-first and last chapter of the book, treating of the utility of
   eggs and some other substances which favour coitus; of tribady and the
   woman who first conceived this description of voluptuousness; of
   paederasty and matters concerned with it; of procuresses and the
   sundry ruses by which one may get possession of a woman; of facetiae,
   jokes, anecdotes, and several questions concerning coitus in general.'
   
   What would be the surprise of the translator to find a community of
   views and sentiments existing between himself, a representative of
   modern civilization, and this Arab, who lived more than three hundred
   years ago. He could only express his regret for having entertained so
   bad an opinion of his master, for having believed for one moment in an
   omission on his part, and for having doubted his competency to deal
   with the various questions spoken of.
   
   Does not the discovery of a text so complete authorise us to admit the
   existence of two works, one elementary, the other learned? And might
   it not be by reason of a little remnant of bashfulness, that the
   author has reserved for the twentieth chapter, without any previous
   allusion, the remarkable subjects which we do not find hinted at in
   any other place?
   
   To put the question in this fashion is at the same time to solve it,
   and to solve it in the affirmative. That interminable chapter would
   not be a product of interpolations. It is too long and too serious a
   work to admit of such a supposition. The little that we have seen of
   it seems to bear the stamp of a well-pronounced originality, and to be
   composed with too much method, not to be the work - and entirely the
   work - of the master.
   
   One may be surprised that this text is so rare, but the answer is very
   simple. As the translator judiciously observes in his notice, the
   matters treated in the twenty-first chapter are of a nature to startle
   many people. See! an Arab who practises in secret paederasty, affects
   in public rigid and austere manners, while he discusses without
   constraint in his conversation everything that concerns the natural
   coitus. Thus you will easily understand that he would not wish to be
   suspected of reading such a book, by which his reputation would be
   compromised In the eyes of his co-religionists, while he would,
   without hesitation, exhibit a book which treated of the coitus only.
   Another consideration, moreover, suffices completely to explain the
   rarity of the work; its compass makes it very expensive, and the
   manuscript is not attainable by everybody on account of the high price
   it reaches.
   
   However it may be, as regards the origin of the text, having the three
   documents in our possession we have given careful revision to the
   translation of M -. Each doubtful point has been the object of minute
   research, and has been generally cleared up by one or the other. When
   there were several acceptable versions, we chose that which was the
   most fit for the context, and many mutilated passages were restored.
   Nor were we afraid to make additions in borrowing from the extended
   text what appeared to us worthy of reproduction, and for the omission
   of which we should have been blamed by the reader. We were careful,
   however, not to overload the work, and to introduce no new matter
   which would militate against the peculiar character of the original
   translation. It is partly for this last reason, and still more so
   because the work required for this undertaking surpassed our strength,
   that we could not bring to light, to our great regret, the treasures
   concealed in the twenty-first chapter, as well as a certaIn number of
   new tales not less acceptable than those which we have given, id with
   which we have enriched the text.
   
   We must not conceal that, leaving out of sight these alterations, we
   have not scrupled to refine the phrases, round off the periods,
   correct the phraseology, and, in short, to amend even the form of the
   translation which, in many instances, left much to be desired. It was
   a matter of necessity that the perusal of the contents of the book
   should be made agreeable. Now, the translator, with the most
   praiseworthy intentions, had been too anxious to render the Arabic
   text, with its short jumbled sentences, as clearly as possible, and
   had thus made the reading painfully laborious. Looking at some
   passages, it may even be supposed that he had only jotted them down,
   particularly towards the end, and had not been able, for some reason
   or other, to revise them until it was too late.
   
   The new matter introduced has compelled us to make modifications in
   the notes of the translator, and to add new notes for the better
   elucidation of the subjects which had not been treated before. We have
   been, with respect to these notes, as careful as we were with respect
   to the text, endeavouring to respect as much as possible the personal
   work of the translator.
   
   Now that the reader has all the necessary information about the French
   edition of the Sheikh Nefzaoui's work, he will permit us to make, in
   conclusion, a few remarks upon the ensemble of the book.
   
   There are found in it many passages which are not attractive. The
   extraordinary ideas displayed - for instance, those about medicines
   and concerning the meanings of dreams - clash too directly with modern
   thought not to awaken in the reader a feeling more of boredom than of
   pleasure.
   
   The work is certaInly encumbered with a quantity of matter which
   cannot but appear ridiculous in the eyes of the civilised modern
   reader; but we should not have been justified in weeding it out. We
   were bound to keep it intact as we had received it from our
   translator. We have held with the Italian proverb, Traduttore,
   traditore, that a work loses sufficient of its originality by being
   conveyed from its own tongue into another, and we hope that the plan
   we have adopted will meet with general approval. Those oddities are,
   moreover, instructive, as they make us acquainted with the manner and
   character of the Arab under a peculiar aspect, and not only of the
   Arab who was contemporary with our author, but also with the Arab of
   our own day. The latter is, in fact, not much more advanced than was
   the former. Although our contact with the race becomes closer every
   day in Tunis, Morocco, Egypt, and other Mussulman countries, they hold
   to their old medical prescriptions, have the same belief in
   divination, and honour the same mass of ridiculous notions, in which
   sorcery and amulets play a large part, and which appear to us
   supremely absurd. At the same time, one may observe from the very
   passages which we here refer to, that this people was not so averse as
   one might believe to witticisms, for the pun (calembour) occupies an
   important position in the explanations of dreams with which the author
   has studded the chapters on the sexual organs, apparently for no
   particular reason, but no doubt with the idea that no matter of
   interest should be absent from his work
   
   The reader will perhaps also find that probability is frequently
   sacrificed to imagination. This is a distinctive mark in Arabic
   literature, and our work could not otherwise but exhibit the faults
   inherent in the genius of this race, which revels in the love for the
   marvellous, and amongst whose chief literary productions are to be
   counted The Thousand and One the Nights. But if these tales show such
   defaults very glaringly, they exhibit, on the other hand, charming
   qualities: simplicity, grace, delicacy; a mine of precious things
   which has been explored and made use of by many modern authors. We
   have pointed out, in some notes, the relationship which we found
   between these tales and those of Boccaccio and La Fontaine, but we
   could not draw attention to all. We had to pass over many with
   silence, and amongst them some of the most striking, as for instance
   in the case of `The Man Expert in Stratagems Duped by his Wife', which
   we find reproduced with all the perfect mastership of Balzac at the
   end of La Physiologie du Moorage.
   
   We will not pursue this sketch any further. If instead of commencing
   the book with a preface we have preferred to address the reader at the
   end, this was done in order not to impose our views upon him and thus
   to stand between him and the work. Whether these additional lines will
   be read by him or not, we believe that we have done our duty by
   informing him of the direction we gave to our work. We tried, on the
   one hand, to prove the merits of the translator who furnished the
   basis for our labours, that is to say, the part which required the
   most science and study; while, on the other hand, we desired our
   readers to know in how far his translation had to be recast.
   
   To the Arabophile who would wish to produce a better translation the
   way is left open; and in perfecting the work he is free to uncover the
   unknown beauties of the twenty-first chapter to his admiring
   contemporaries.
