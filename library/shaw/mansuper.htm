MAN AND SUPERMAN: A COMEDY AND A PLAY  by George Bernard Shaw  (1903)                                                                            


                          EPISTLE DEDICATORY                                
                      TO ARTHUR BINGHAM WALKLEY                             
  My dear Walkley                                                           
  You once asked me why I did not write a Don Juan play. The levity         
with which you assumed this frightful responsibility has probably by        
this time enabled you to forget it; but the day of reckoning has            
arrived: here is your play! I say your play, because *qui facit per         
alium facit per se.* Its profits, like its labor, belong to me:           
its morals, its manners, its philosophy, its influence on the young,        
are for you to justify. You were of mature age when you made the            
suggestion; and you knew your man. It is hardly fifteen years since,        
as twin pioneers of the New Journalism of that time, we two, cradled        
in the same new sheets, began an epoch in the criticism of the theatre      
and the opera house by making it the pretext for a propaganda of our        
own views of life. So you cannot plead ignorance of the character of        
the force you set in motion. You meant me to epater le bourgeois;           
and if he protests, I hereby refer him to you as the accountable            
party.                                                                      
  I warn you that if you attempt to repudiate your responsibility, I        
shall suspect you of finding the play too decorous for your taste. The      
fifteen years have made me older and graver. In you I can detect no         
such becoming change. Your levities and audacities are like the             
loves and comforts prayed for by Desdemona: they increase, even as          
your days do grow. No mere pioneering journal dares meddle with them        
now: the stately Times itself is alone sufficiently above suspicion to      
act as your chaperone; and even the Times must sometimes thank its          
stars that new plays are not produced every day, since after each such      
event its gravity is compromised, its platitude turned to epigram, its      
portentousness to wit, its propriety to elegance, and even its decorum      
into naughtiness by criticisms which the traditions of the paper do         
not allow you to sign at the end, but which you take care to sign with      
the most extravagant flourishes between the lines. I am not sure            
that this is not a portent of Revolution. In eighteenth century France      
the end was at hand when men bought the Encyclopedia and found Diderot      
there. When I buy the Times and find you there, my prophetic ear            
catches a rattle of twentieth century tumbrils.                             
  However, that is not my present anxiety. The question is, will you        
not be disappointed with a Don Juan play in which not one of that           
hero's *mille etre adventures is brought upon the stage? To                
propitiate you, let me explain myself. You will retort that I never do      
anything else: it is your favorite jibe at me that what I call drama        
is nothing but explanation. But you must not expect me to adopt your        
inexplicable, fantastic, petulant, fastidious ways: you must take me        
as I am, a reasonable, patient, consistent, apologetic, laborious           
person, with the temperament of a schoolmaster and the pursuits of a        
vestryman. No doubt that literary knack of mine which happens to amuse      
the British public distracts attention from my character; but the           
character is there none the less, solid as bricks. I have a                 
conscience; and conscience is always anxiously explanatory. You, on         
the contrary, feel that a man who discusses his conscience is much          
like a woman who discusses her modesty. The only moral force you            
condescend to parade is the force of your wit: the only demand you          
make in public is the demand of your artistic temperament for               
symmetry, elegance, style, grace, refinement, and the cleanliness           
which comes next to godliness if not before it. But my conscience is        
the genuine pulpit article: it annoys me to see people comfortable          
when they ought to be uncomfortable; and I insist on making them think      
in order to bring them to conviction of sin. If you dont like my            
preaching you must lump it. I really cannot help it.                        
  In the preface to my Plays for Puritans I explained the                   
predicament of our contemporary English drama, forced to deal almost        
exclusively with cases of sexual attraction, and yet forbidden to           
exhibit the incidents of that attraction or even to discuss its             
nature. Your suggestion that I should write a Don Juan play was             
virtually a challenge to me to treat this subject myself dramatically.      
The challenge was difficult enough to be worth accepting, because,          
when you come to think of it, though we have plenty of dramas with          
heroes and heroines who are in love and must accordingly marry or           
perish at the end of the play, or about people whose relations with         
one another have been complicated by the marriage laws, not to mention      
the looser sort of plays which trade on the tradition that illicit          
love affairs are at once vicious and delightful, we have no modern          
English plays in which the natural attraction of the sexes for one          
another is made the mainspring of the action. That is why we insist on      
beauty in our performers, differing herein from the countries our           
friend William Archer holds up as examples of seriousness to our            
childish theatres. There the Juliets and Isoldes, the Romeos and            
Tristans, might be our mothers and fathers. Not so the English              
actress. The heroine she impersonates is not allowed to discuss the         
elemental relations of men and women: all her romantic twaddle about        
novelet-made love, all her purely legal dilemmas as to whether she was      
married or "betrayed," quite miss our hearts and worry our minds. To        
console ourselves we must just look at her. We do so; and her beauty        
feeds our starving emotions. Sometimes we grumble ungallantly at the        
lady because she does not act as well as she looks. But in a drama          
which, with all its preoccupation with sex, is really void of sexual        
interest, good looks are more desired than histrionic skill.                
  Let me press this point on you, since you are too clever to raise         
the fool's cry of paradox whenever I take hold of a stick by the right      
instead of the wrong end. Why are our occasional attempts to deal with      
the sex problem on the stage so repulsive and dreary that even those        
who are most determined that sex questions shall be held open and           
their discussion kept free, cannot pretend to relish these joyless          
attempts at social sanitation? Is it not because at bottom they are         
utterly sexless? What is the usual formula for such plays? A woman          
has, on some past occasion, been brought into conflict with the law         
which regulates the relations of the sexes. A man, by falling in            
love with her, or marrying her, is brought into conflict with the           
social convention which discountenances the woman. Now the conflicts        
of individuals with law and convention can be dramatized like all           
other human conflicts; but they are purely judicial; and the fact that      
we are much more curious about the suppressed relations between the         
man and the woman than about the relations between both and our courts      
of law and private juries of matrons, produces that sensation of            
evasion, of dissatisfaction, of fundamental irrelevance, of                 
shallowness, of useless disagreeableness, of total failure to edify         
and partial failure to interest, which is as familiar to you in the         
theatres as it was to me when I, too, frequented those uncomfortable        
buildings, and found our popular playwrights in the mind to (as they        
thought) emulate Ibsen.                                                     
  I take it that when you asked me for a Don Juan play you did not          
want that sort of thing. Nobody does: the successes such plays              
sometimes obtain are due to the incidental conventional melodrama with      
which the experienced popular author instinctively saves himself            
from failure. But what did you want? Owing to your unfortunate              
habit- you now, I hope, feel its inconvenience- of not explaining           
yourself, I have had to discover this for myself. First, then, I            
have had to ask myself, what is a Don Juan? Vulgarly, a libertine. But      
your dislike of vulgarity is pushed to the length of a defect               
(universality of character is impossible without a share of                 
vulgarity); and even if you could acquire the taste, you would find         
yourself overfed from ordinary sources without troubling me. So I took      
it that you demanded a Don Juan in the philosophic sense.                   
  Philosophically, Don Juan is a man who, though gifted enough to be        
exceptionally capable of distinguishing between good and evil, follows      
his own instincts without regard to the common, statute, or canon law;      
and therefore, whilst gaining the ardent sympathy of our rebellious         
instincts (which are flattered by the brilliancies with which Don Juan      
associates them) finds himself in mortal conflict with existing             
institutions, and defends himself by fraud and force as unscrupulously      
as a farmer defends his crops by the same means against vermin. The         
prototypic Don Juan, invented early in the XVI century by a Spanish         
monk, was presented, according to the ideas of that time, as the enemy      
of God, the approach of whose vengeance is felt throughout the              
drama, growing in menace from minute to minute. No anxiety is caused        
on Don Juan's account by any minor antagonist: he easily eludes the         
police, temporal and spiritual; and when an indignant father seeks          
private redress with the sword, Don Juan kills him without an               
effort. Not until the slain father returns from heaven as the agent of      
God, in the form of his own statue, does he prevail against his slayer      
and cast him into hell. The moral is a monkish one: repent and              
reform now; for tomorrow it may be too late. This is really the only        
point on which Don Juan is sceptical; for he is a devout believer in        
an ultimate hell, and risks damnation only because, as he is young, it      
seems so far off that repentance can be postponed until he has              
amused himself to his heart's content.                                      
  But the lesson intended by an author is hardly ever the lesson the        
world chooses to learn from his book. What attracts and impresses us        
in El Burlador de Sevilla is not the immediate urgency of                   
repentance, but the heroism of daring to be the enemy of God. From          
Prometheus to my own Devil's Disciple, such enemies have always been        
popular. Don Juan became such a pet that the world could not bear           
his damnation. It reconciled him sentimentally to God in a second           
version, and clamored for his canonization for a whole century, thus        
treating him as English journalism has treated that comic foe of the        
gods, Punch. Moliere's Don Juan casts back to the original in point of      
impenitence; but in piety he falls off greatly. True, he also proposes      
to repent; but in what terms! "Oui, ma foi! il faut s'amender.              
Encore vingt ou trente ans de cette vie-ci, et puis nous songerons a        
nous." After Moliere comes the artist-enchanter, the master beloved by      
masters, Mozart, revealing the hero's spirit in magical harmonies,          
elfin tones, and elate darting rhythms as of summer lightning made          
audible. Here you have freedom in love and in morality mocking              
exquisitely at slavery to them, and interesting you, attracting you,        
tempting you, inexplicably forcing you to range the hero with his           
enemy the statue on a transcendant plane, leaving the prudish daughter      
and her priggish lover on a crockery shelf below to live piously            
ever after.                                                                 
  After these completed works Byron's fragment does not count for much      
philosophically. Our vagabond libertines are no more interesting            
from that point of view than the sailor who has a wife in every             
port; and Byron's hero is, after all, only a vagabond libertine. And        
he is dumb: he does not discuss himself with a Sganarelle-Leporello or      
with the fathers or brothers of his mistresses: he does not even, like      
Casanova, tell his own story. In fact he is not a true Don Juan at          
all; for he is no more an enemy of God than any romantic and                
adventurous young sower of wild oats. Had you and I been in his             
place at his age, who knows whether we might not have done as he            
did, unless indeed your fastidiousness had saved you from the               
empress Catherine. Byron was as little of a philosopher as Peter the        
Great: both were instances of that rare and useful, but unedifying          
variation, an energetic genius born without the prejudices or               
superstitions of his contemporaries. The resultant unscrupulous             
freedom of thought made Byron a bolder poet than Wordsworth just as it      
made Peter a bolder king than George III; but as it was, after all,         
only a negative qualification, it did not prevent Peter from being          
an appalling blackguard and an arrant poltroon, nor did it enable           
Byron to become a religious force like Shelley. Let us, then, leave         
Byron's Don Juan out of account. Mozart's is the last of the true           
Don Juans; for by the time he was of age, his cousin Faust had, in the      
hands of Goethe, taken his place and carried both his warfare and           
his reconciliation with the gods far beyond mere lovemaking into            
politics, high art, schemes for reclaiming new continents from the          
ocean, and recognition of an eternal womanly principle in the               
universe. Goethe's Faust and Mozart's Don Juan were the last words          
of the XVIII century on the subject; and by the time the polite             
critics of the XIX century, ignoring William Blake as superficially as      
the XVIII had ignored Hogarth or the XVII Bunyan, had got past the          
Dickens-Macaulay Dumas-Guizot stage and the                                 
Stendhal-Meredith-Turgenieff stage, and were confronted with                
philosophic fiction by such pens as Ibsen's and Tolstoy's, Don Juan         
had changed his sex and become Dona Juana, breaking out of the              
Doll's House and asserting herself as an individual instead of a            
mere item in a moral pageant.                                               
  Now it is all very well for you at the beginning of the XX century        
to ask me for a Don Juan play; but you will see from the foregoing          
survey that Don Juan is a full century out of date for you and for me;      
and if there are millions of less literate people who are still in the      
eighteenth century, have they not Moliere and Mozart, upon whose art        
no human hand can improve? You would laugh at me if at this time of         
day I dealt in duels and ghosts and "womanly" women. As to mere             
libertinism, you would be the first to remind me that the Festin de         
Pierre of Moliere is not a play for amorists, and that one bar of           
the voluptuous sentimentality of Gounod or Bizet would appear as a          
licentious stain on the score of Don Giovanni. Even the more                
abstract parts of the Don Juan play are dilapidated past use: for           
instance, Don Juan's supernatural antagonist hurled those who refuse        
to repent into lakes of burning brimstone, there to be tormented by         
devils with horns and tails. Of that antagonist, and of that                
conception of repentance, how much is left that could be used in a          
play by me dedicated to you? On the other hand, those forces of middle      
class public opinion which hardly existed for a Spanish nobleman in         
the days of the first Don Juan, are now triumphant everywhere.              
Civilized society is one huge bourgeoisie: no nobleman dares now shock      
his greengrocer. The women, "marchesane, principesse, cameriere,            
cittadine" and all, are become equally dangerous: the sex is                
aggressive, powerful: when women are wronged they do not group              
themselves pathetically to sing "Protegga il giusto cielo": they grasp      
formidable legal and social weapons, and retaliate. Political               
parties are wrecked and public careers undone by a single                   
indiscretion. A man had better have all the statues in London to            
supper with him, ugly as they are, than be brought to the bar of the        
Nonconformist Conscience by Donna Elvira. Excommunication has become        
almost as serious a business as it was in the tenth century.                
  As a result, Man is no longer, like Don Juan, victor in the duel          
of sex. Whether he has ever really been may be doubted: at all              
events the enormous superiority of Woman's natural position in this         
matter is telling with greater and greater force. As to pulling the         
Nonconformist Conscience by the beard as Don Juan plucked the beard of      
the Commandant's statue in the convent of San Francisco, that is out        
of the question nowadays: prudence and good manners alike forbid it to      
a hero with any mind. Besides, it is Don Juan's own beard that is in        
danger of plucking. Far from relapsing into hypocrisy, as Sganarelle        
feared, he has unexpectedly discovered a moral in his immorality.           
The growing recognition of his new point of view is heaping                 
responsibility on him. His former jests he has had to take as               
seriously as I have had to take some of the jests of Mr W. S. Gilbert.      
His scepticism, once his least tolerated quality, has now triumphed so      
completely that he can no longer assert himself by witty negations,         
and must, to save himself from cipherdom, find an affirmative               
position. His thousand and three affairs of gallantry, after becoming,      
at most, two immature intrigues leading to sordid and prolonged             
complications and humiliations, have been discarded altogether as           
unworthy of his philosophic dignity and compromising to his newly           
acknowledged position as the founder of a school. Instead of                
pretending to read Ovid he does actually read Schopenhauer and              
Nietzsche, studies Westermarck, and is concerned for the future of the      
race instead of for the freedom of his own instincts. Thus his              
profligacy and his dare-devil airs have gone the way of his sword           
and mandoline into the rag shop of anachronisms and superstitions.          
In fact, he is now more Hamlet than Don Juan; for though the lines put      
into the actor's mouth to indicate to the pit that Hamlet is a              
philosopher are for the most part mere harmonious platitude which,          
with a little debasement of the word-music, would be properer to            
Pecksniff, yet if you separate the real hero, inarticulate and              
unintelligible to himself except in flashes of inspiration, from the        
performer who has to talk at any cost through five acts; and if you         
also do what you must always do in Shakespear's tragedies: that is,         
dissect out the absurd sensational incidents and physical violences of      
the borrowed story from the genuine Shakespearian tissue, you will get      
a true Promethean foe of the gods, whose instinctive attitude               
towards women much resembles that to which Don Juan is now driven.          
From this point of view Hamlet was a developed Don Juan whom                
Shakespear palmed off as a reputable man just as he palmed poor             
Macbeth off as a murderer. Today the palming off is no longer               
necessary (at least on your plane and mine) because Don Juanism is          
no longer misunderstood as mere Casanovism. Don Juan himself is almost      
ascetic in his desire to avoid that misunderstanding; and so my             
attempt to bring him up to date by launching him as a modern                
Englishman into a modern English environment has produced a figure          
superficially quite unlike the hero of Mozart.                              
  And yet I have not the heart to disappoint you wholly of another          
glimpse of the Mozartian *dissoluto punito* and his antagonist the          
statue. I feel sure you would like to know more of that statue- to          
draw him out when he is off duty, so to speak. To gratify you, I            
have resorted to the trick of the strolling theatrical manager who          
advertizes the pantomime of Sinbad the Sailor with a stock of               
second-hand picture posters designed for Ali Baba. He simply thrusts a      
few oil jars into the valley of diamonds, and so fulfils the promise        
held out by the hoardings to the public eye. I have adapted this            
easy device to our occasion by thrusting into my perfectly modern           
three-act play a totally extraneous act in which my hero, enchanted by      
the air of the Sierra, has a dream in which his Mozartian ancestor          
appears and philosophizes at great length in a Shavio-Socratic              
dialogue with the lady, the statue, and the devil.                          
  But this pleasantry is not the essence of the play. Over this             
essence I have no control. You propound a certain social substance,         
sexual attraction to wit, for dramatic distillation; and I distil it        
for you. I do not adulterate the product with aphrodisiacs nor              
dilute it with romance and water; for I am merely executing your            
commission, not producing a popular play for the market. You must           
therefore (unless, like most wise men, you read the play first and the      
preface afterwards) prepare yourself to face a trumpery story of            
modern London life, a life in which, as you know, the ordinary man's        
main business is to get means to keep up the position and habits of         
a gentleman, and the ordinary woman's business is to get married. In        
9,999 cases out of 10,000, you can count on their doing nothing,            
whether noble or base, that conflicts with these ends; and that             
assurance is what you rely on as their religion, their morality, their      
principles, their patriotism, their reputation, their honor and so          
forth.                                                                      
  On the whole, this is a sensible and satisfactory foundation for          
society. Money means nourishment and marriage means children; and that      
men should put nourishment first and women children first is,               
broadly speaking, the law of Nature and not the dictate of personal         
ambition. The secret of the prosaic man's success, such as it is, is        
the simplicity with which he pursues these ends: the secret of the          
artistic man's failure, such as that is, is the versatility with which      
he strays in all directions after secondary ideals. The artist is           
either a poet or a scallawag: as poet, he cannot see, as the prosaic        
man does, that chivalry is at bottom only romantic suicide: as              
scallawag, he cannot see that it does not pay to spunge and beg and         
lie and brag and neglect his person. Therefore do not misunderstand my      
plain statement of the fundamental constitution of London society as        
an Irishman's reproach to your nation. From the day I first set foot        
on this foreign soil I knew the value of the prosaic qualities of           
which Irishmen teach Englishmen to be ashamed as well as I knew the         
vanity of the poetic qualities of which Englishmen teach Irishmen to        
be proud. For the Irishman instinctively disparages the quality             
which makes the Englishman dangerous to him; and the Englishman             
instinctively flatters the fault that makes the Irishman harmless           
and amusing to him. What is wrong with the prosaic Englishman is            
what is wrong with the prosaic men of all countries: stupidity. The         
vitality which places nourishment and children first, heaven and            
hell a somewhat remote second, and the health of society as an organic      
whole nowhere, may muddle successfully through the comparatively            
tribal stages of gregariousness; but in nineteenth century nations and      
twentieth century commonwealths the resolve of every man to be rich at      
all costs, and of every woman to be married at all costs, must,             
without a highly scientific social organization, produce a ruinous          
development of poverty, celibacy, prostitution, infant mortality,           
adult degeneracy, and everything that wise men most dread. In short,        
there is no future for men, however brimming with crude vitality,           
who are neither intelligent nor politically educated enough to be           
Socialists. So do not misunderstand me in the other direction               
either: if I appreciate the vital qualities of the Englishman as I          
appreciate the vital qualities of the bee, I do not guarantee the           
Englishmen against being, like the bee (or the Canaanite) smoked out        
and unloaded of his honey by beings inferior to himself in simple           
acquisitiveness, combativeness, and fecundity, but superior to him          
in imagination and cunning.                                                 
  The Don Juan play, however, is to deal with sexual attraction, and        
not with nutrition, and to deal with it in a society in which the           
serious business of sex is left by men to women, as the serious             
business of nutrition is left by women to men. That the men, to             
protect themselves against a too aggressive prosecution of the women's      
business, have set up a feeble romantic convention that the initiative      
in sex business must always come from the man, is true; but the             
pretence is so shallow that even in the theatre, that last sanctuary        
of unreality, it imposes only on the inexperienced. In Shakespear's         
plays the woman always takes the initiative. In his problem plays           
and his popular plays alike the love interest is the interest of            
seeing the woman hunt the man down. She may do it by charming him,          
like Rosalind, or by stratagem, like Mariana; but in every case the         
relation between the woman and the man is the same: she is the pursuer      
and contriver, he the pursued and disposed of. When she is baffled,         
like Ophelia, she goes mad and commits suicide; and the man goes            
straight from her funeral to a fencing match. No doubt Nature, with         
very young creatures, may save the woman the trouble of scheming:           
Prospero knows that he has only to throw Ferdinand and Miranda              
together and they will mate like a pair of doves; and there is no need      
for Perdita to capture Florizel as the lady doctor in All's Well            
That Ends Well (an early Ibsenite heroine) captures Bertram. But the        
mature cases all illustrate the Shakespearian law. The one apparent         
exception, Petruchio, is not a real one: he is most carefully               
characterized as a purely commercial matrimonial adventurer. Once he        
is assured that Katharine has money, he undertakes to marry her before      
he has seen her. In real life we find not only Petruchios, but              
Mantalinis and Dobbins who pursue women with appeals to their pity          
or jealousy or vanity, or cling to them in a romantically infatuated        
way. Such effeminates do not count in the world scheme: even Bunsby         
dropping like a fascinated bird into the jaws of Mrs MacStinger is          
by comparison a true tragic object of pity and terror. I find in my         
own plays that Woman, projecting herself dramatically by my hands (a        
process over which I assure you I have no more real control than I          
have over my wife), behaves just as Woman did in the plays of               
Shakespear.                                                                 
  And so your Don Juan has come to birth as a stage projection of           
the tragi-comic love chase of the man by the woman; and my Don Juan is      
the quarry instead of the huntsman. Yet he is a true Don Juan, with         
a sense of reality that disables convention, defying to the last the        
fate which finally overtakes him. The woman's need of him to enable         
her to carry on Nature's most urgent work, does not prevail against         
him until his resistance gathers her energy to a climax at which she        
dares to throw away her customary exploitations of the conventional         
affectionate and dutiful poses, and claim him by natural right for a        
purpose that far transcends their mortal personal purposes.                 
  Among the friends to whom I have read this play in manuscript are         
some of our own sex who are shocked at the "unscrupulousness," meaning      
the utter disregard of masculine fastidiousness, with which the             
woman pursues her purpose. It does not occur to them that if women          
were as fastidious as men, morally or physically, there would be an         
end of the race. Is there anything meaner than to throw necessary work      
upon other people and then disparage it as unworthy and indelicate. We      
laugh at the haughty American nation because it makes the negro             
clean its boots and then proves the moral and physical inferiority          
of the negro by the fact that he's a shoeblack; but we ourselves throw      
the whole drudgery of creation on one sex, and then imply that no           
female of any womanliness or delicacy would initiate any effort in          
that direction. There are no limits to male hypocrisy in this               
matter. No doubt there are moments when man's sexual immunities are         
made acutely humiliating to him. When the terrible moment of birth          
arrives, its supreme importance and its superhuman effort and peril,        
in which the father has no part, dwarf him into the meanest                 
insignificance: he slinks out of the way of the humblest petticoat,         
happy if he be poor enough to be pushed out of the house to outface         
his ignominy by drunken rejoicings. But when the crisis is over he          
takes his revenge, swaggering as the breadwinner, and speaking of           
Woman's "sphere" with condescension, even with chivalry, as if the          
kitchen and the nursery were less important than the office in the          
city. When his swagger is exhausted he drivels into erotic poetry or        
sentimental uxoriousness; and the Tennysonian King Arthur posing at         
Guinevere becomes Don Quixote grovelling before Dulcinea. You must          
admit that here Nature beats Comedy out of the field: the wildest           
hominist or feminist farce is insipid after the most commonplace            
"slice of life." The pretence that women do not take the initiative is      
part of the farce. Why, the whole world is strewn with snares,              
traps, gins, and pitfalls for the capture of men by women. Give             
women the vote, and in five years there will be a crushing tax on           
bachelors. Men, on the other hand, attach penalties to marriage,            
depriving women of property, of the franchise, of the free use of           
their limbs, of that ancient symbol of immortality, the right to            
make oneself at home in the house of God by taking off the hat, of          
everything that he can force Woman to dispense with without compelling      
himself to dispense with her. All in vain. Woman must marry because         
the race must perish without her travail: if the risk of death and the      
certainty of pain, danger, and unutterable discomforts cannot deter         
her, slavery and swaddled ankles will not. And yet we assume that           
the force that carries women through all these perils and hardships,        
stops abashed before the primnesses of our behavior for young               
ladies. It is assumed that the woman must wait, motionless, until           
she is wooed. Nay, she often does wait motionless. That is how the          
spider waits for the fly. But the spider spins her web. And if the          
fly, like my hero, shews a strength that promises to extricate him,         
how swiftly does she abandon her pretence of passiveness, and openly        
fling coil after coil about him until he is secured for ever!               
  If the really impressive books and other art-works of the world were      
produced by ordinary men, they would express more fear of women's           
pursuit than love of their illusory beauty. But ordinary men cannot         
produce really impressive art-works. Those who can are men of               
genius: that is, men selected by Nature to carry on the work of             
building up an intellectual consciousness of her own instinctive            
purpose. Accordingly, we observe in the man of genius all the               
unscrupulousness and all the "self-sacrifice" (the two things are           
the same) of Woman. He will risk the stake and the cross; starve, when      
necessary, in a garret all his life; study women and live on their          
work and care as Darwin studied worms and lived upon sheep; work his        
nerves into rags without payment, a sublime altruist in his                 
disregard of himself, an atrocious egotist in his disregard of others.      
Here Woman meets a purpose as impersonal, as irresistible as her            
own; and the clash is sometimes tragic. When it is complicated by           
the genius being a woman, then the game is one for a king of                
critics: your George Sand becomes a mother to gain experience for           
the novelist and to develop her, and gobbles up men of genius,              
Chopins, Mussets and the like, as mere hors d'oeuvres.                      
  I state the extreme case, of course; but what is true of the great        
man who incarnates the philosophic consciousness of Life and the woman      
who incarnates its fecundity, is true in some degree of all geniuses        
and all women. Hence it is that the world's books get written, its          
pictures painted, its statues modelled, its symphonies composed, by         
people who are free from the otherwise universal dominion of the            
tyranny of sex. Which leads us to the conclusion, astonishing to the        
vulgar, that art, instead of being before all things the expression of      
the normal sexual situation, is really the only department in which         
sex is a superseded and secondary power, with its consciousness so          
confused and its purpose so perverted, that its ideas are mere fantasy      
to common men. Whether the artist becomes poet or philosopher,              
moralist or founder of a religion, his sexual doctrine is nothing           
but a barren special pleading for pleasure, excitement, and                 
knowledge when he is young, and for contemplative tranquillity when         
he's old and satiated. Romance and Asceticism, Amorism and                  
Puritanism are equally unreal in the great Philistine world. The world      
shewn us in books, whether the books be confessed epics or professed        
gospels, or in codes, or in political orations, or in philosophic           
systems, is not the main world at all: it is only the                       
self-consciousness of certain abnormal people who have the specific         
artistic talent and temperament. A serious matter this for you and me,      
because the man whose consciousness does not correspond to that of the      
majority is a madman; and the old habit of worshipping madmen is            
giving way to the new habit of locking them up. And since what we call      
education and culture is for the most part nothing but the                  
substitution of reading for experience, of literature for life, of the      
obsolete fictitious for the contemporary real, education, as you no         
doubt observed at Oxford, destroys, by supplantation, every mind            
that is not strong enough to see through the imposture and to use           
the great Masters of Arts as what they really are and no more: that         
is, patentees of highly questionable methods of thinking, and               
manufacturers of highly questionable, and for the majority but half         
valid representations of life. The schoolboy who uses his Homer to          
throw at his fellow's head makes perhaps the safest and most                
rational use of him; and I observe with reassurance that you                
occasionally do the same, in your prime, with your Aristotle.               
  Fortunately for us, whose minds have been so overwhelmingly               
sophisticated by literature, what produces all these treatises and          
poems and scriptures of one sort or another is the struggle of Life to      
become divinely conscious of itself instead of blindly stumbling            
hither and thither in the line of least resistance. Hence there is a        
driving towards truth in all books on matters where the writer, though      
exceptionally gifted, is normally constituted, and has no private           
axe to grind. Copernicus had no motive for misleading his fellowmen as      
to the place of the sun in the solar system: he looked for it as            
honestly as a shepherd seeks his path in a mist. But Copernicus             
would not have written love stories scientifically. When it comes to        
sex relations, the man of genius does not share the common man's            
danger of capture, nor the woman of genius the common woman's               
overwhelming specialization. And that is why our scriptures and             
other art-works, when they deal with love, turn from honest attempts        
at science in physics to romantic nonsense, erotic ecstasy, or the          
stern asceticism of satiety ("the road of excess leads to the palace        
of wisdom" said William Blake; for "you never know what is enough           
unless you know what is more than enough").                                 
  There is a political aspect of this sex question which is too big         
for my comedy, and too momentous to be passed over without culpable         
frivolity. It is impossible to demonstrate that the initiative in           
sex transactions remains with Woman, and has been confirmed to her, so      
far, more and more by the suppression of rapine and discouragement          
of importunity, without being driven to very serious reflections on         
the fact that this initiative is politically the most important of all      
the initiatives, because our political experiment of democracy, the         
last refuge of cheap misgovernment, will ruin us if our citizens are        
ill bred.                                                                   
  When we two were born, this country was still dominated by a              
selected class bred by political marriages. The commercial class had        
not then completed the first twentyfive years of its new share of           
political power; and it was itself selected by money qualification,         
and bred, if not by political marriage, at least by a pretty                
rigorous class marriage. Aristocracy and plutocracy still furnish           
the figureheads of politics; but they are now dependent on the votes        
of the promiscuously bred masses. And this, if you please, at the very      
moment when the political problem, having suddenly ceased to mean a         
very limited and occasional interference, mostly by way of jobbing          
public appointments, in the mismanagement of a tight but parochial          
little island, with occasional meaningless prosecution of dynastic          
wars, has become the industrial reorganization of Britain, the              
construction of a practically international Commonwealth, and the           
partition of the whole of Africa and perhaps the whole of Asia by           
the civilized Powers. Can you believe that the people whose                 
conceptions of society and conduct, whose power of attention and scope      
of interest, are measured by the British theatre as you know it today,      
can either handle this colossal task themselves, or understand and          
support the sort of mind and character that is (at least                    
comparatively) capable of handling it? For remember: what our voters        
are in the pit and gallery they are also in the polling booth. We           
are all now under what Burke called "the hoofs of the swinish               
multitude." Burke's language gave great offence because the implied         
exceptions to its universal application made it a class insult; and it      
certainly was not for the pot to call the kettle black. The                 
aristocracy he defended, in spite of the political marriages by             
which it tried to secure breeding for itself, had its mind                  
undertrained by silly schoolmasters and governesses, its character          
corrupted by gratuitous luxury, its self-respect adulterated to             
complete spuriousness by flattery and flunkeyism. It is no better           
today and never will be any better: our very peasants have something        
morally hardier in them that culminates occasionally in a Bunyan, a         
Burns, or a Carlyle. But observe, this aristocracy, which was               
overpowered from 1832 to 1885 by the middle class, has come back to         
power by the votes of "the swinish multitude." Tom Paine has triumphed      
over Edmund Burke; and the swine are now courted electors. How many of      
their own class have these electors sent to parliament? Hardly a dozen      
out of 670, and these only under the persuasion of conspicuous              
personal qualifications and popular eloquence. The multitude thus           
pronounces judgment on its own units: it admits itself unfit to             
govern, and will vote only for a man morphologically and generically        
transfigured by palatial residence and equipage, by transcendent            
tailoring, by the glamor of aristocratic kinship. Well, we two know         
these transfigured persons, these college passmen, these well               
groomed monocular Algys and Bobbies, these cricketers to whom age           
brings golf instead of wisdom, these plutocratic products of "the nail      
and sarspan business as he got his money by." Do you know whether to        
laugh or cry at the notion that they, poor devils! will drive a team        
of continents as they drive a four-in-hand; turn a jostling anarchy of      
casual trade and speculation into an ordered productivity; and              
federate our colonies into a world-Power of the first magnitude?            
Give these people the most perfect political constitution and the           
soundest political program that benevolent omniscience can devise           
for them, and they will interpret it into mere fashionable folly or         
canting charity as infallibly as a savage converts the philosophical        
theology of a Scotch missionary into crude African idolatry.                
  I do not know whether you have any illusions left on the subject          
of education, progress, and so forth. I have none. Any pamphleteer can      
shew the way to better things; but when there is no will there is no        
way. My nurse was fond of remarking that you cannot make a silk             
purse out of a sow's ear; and the more I see of the efforts of our          
churches and universities and literary sages to raise the mass above        
its own level, the more convinced I am that my nurse was right.             
Progress can do nothing but make the most of us all as we are, and          
that most would clearly not be enough even if those who are already         
raised out of the lowest abysses would allow the others a chance.           
The bubble of Heredity has been pricked: the certainty that                 
acquirements are negligible as elements in practical heredity has           
demolished the hopes of the educationists as well as the terrors of         
the degeneracy mongers; and we know now that there is no hereditary         
"governing class" any more than a hereditary hooliganism. We must           
either breed political capacity or be ruined by Democracy, which was        
forced on us by the failure of the older alternatives. Yet if               
Despotism failed only for want of a capable benevolent despot, what         
chance has Democracy, which requires a whole population of capable          
voters: that is, of political critics who, if they cannot govern in         
person for lack of spare energy or specific talent for administration,      
can at least recognize and appreciate capacity and benevolence in           
others, and so govern through capably benevolent representatives?           
Where are such voters to be found today? Nowhere. Plutocratic               
inbreeding has produced a weakness of character that is too timid to        
face the full stringency of a thoroughly competitive struggle for           
existence and too lazy and petty to organize the commonwealth               
co-operatively. Being cowards, we defeat natural selection under cover      
of philanthropy: being sluggards, we neglect artificial selection           
under cover of delicacy and morality.                                       
  Yet we must get an electorate of capable critics or collapse as Rome      
and Egypt collapsed. At this moment the Roman decadent phase of *panem      
et circenses* is being inaugurated under our eyes. Our newspapers           
and melodramas are blustering about our imperial destiny; but our eyes      
and hearts turn eagerly to the American millionaire. As his hand            
goes down to his pocket, our fingers go up to the brims of our hats by      
instinct. Our ideal prosperity is not the prosperity of the industrial      
north, but the prosperity of the Isle of Wight, of Folkestone and           
Ramsgate, of Nice and Monte Carlo. That is the only prosperity you see      
on the stage, where the workers are all footmen, parlormaids, comic         
lodging-letters, and fashionable professional men, whilst the heroes        
and heroines are miraculously provided with unlimited dividends and         
eat gratuitously, like the knights in Don Quixote's books of chivalry.      
The city papers prate of the competition of Bombay with Manchester and      
the like. The real competition is the competition of Regent Street          
with the Rue de Rivoli, of Brighton and the south coast with the            
Riviera, for the spending money of the American Trusts. What is all         
this growing love of pageantry, this effusive loyalty, this                 
officious rising and uncovering at a wave from a flag or a blast            
from a brass band? Imperialism? Not a bit of it. Obsequiousness,            
servility, cupidity roused by the prevailing smell of money. When Mr        
Carnegie rattled his millions in his pockets all England became one         
rapacious cringe. Only, when Rhodes (who had probably been reading          
my Socialism for Millionaires) left word that no idler was to               
inherit his estate, the bent backs straightened mistrustfully for a         
moment. Could it be that the Diamond King was no gentleman after            
all? However, it was easy to ignore a rich man's solecism. The              
ungentlemanly clause was not mentioned again; and the backs soon bowed      
themselves back into their natural shape.                                   
  But I hear you asking me in alarm whether I have actually put all         
this tub thumping into a Don Juan comedy. I have not. I have only made      
my Don Juan a political pamphleteer, and given you his pamphlet in          
full by way of appendix. You will find it at the end of the book. I am      
sorry to say that it is a common practice with romancers to announce        
their hero as a man of extraordinary genius, and then leave his             
works entirely to the reader's imagination; so that at the end of           
the book you whisper to yourself ruefully that but for the author's         
solemn preliminary assurance you should hardly have given the               
gentleman credit for ordinary good sense. You cannot accuse me of this      
pitiable barrenness, this feeble evasion. I not only tell you that          
my hero wrote a revolutionists' handbook: I give you the handbook at        
full length for your edification if you care to read it. And in that        
handbook you will find the politics of the sex question as I                
conceive Don Juan's descendant to understand them. Not that I disclaim      
the fullest responsibility for his opinions and for those of all my         
characters, pleasant and unpleasant. They are all right from their          
several points of view; and their points of view are, for the dramatic      
moment, mine also. This may puzzle the people who believe that there        
is such a thing as an absolutely right point of view, usually their         
own. It may seem to them that nobody who doubts this can be in a state      
of grace. However that may be, it is certainly true that nobody who         
agrees with them can possibly be a dramatist, or indeed anything            
else that turns upon a knowledge of mankind. Hence it has been pointed      
out that Shakespear had no conscience. Neither have I, in that sense.       
  You may, however, remind me that this digression of mine into             
politics was preceded by a very convincing demonstration that the           
artist never catches the point of view of the common man on the             
question of sex, because he is not in the same predicament. I first         
prove that anything I write on the relation of the sexes is sure to be      
misleading; and then I proceed to write a Don Juan play. Well, if           
you insist on asking me why I behave in this absurd way, I can only         
reply that you asked me to, and that in any case my treatment of the        
subject may be valid for the artist, amusing to the amateur, and at         
least intelligible and therefore possibly suggestive to the                 
Philistine. Every man who records his illusions is providing data           
for the genuinely scientific psychology which the world still waits         
for. I plank down my view of the existing relations of men to women in      
the most highly civilized society for what it is worth. It is a view        
like any other view and no more, neither true nor false, but, I             
hope, a way of looking at the subject which throws into the familiar        
order of cause and effect a sufficient body of fact and experience          
to be interesting to you, if not to the playgoing public of London.         
I have certainly shewn little consideration for that public in this         
enterprise; but I know that it has the friendliest disposition towards      
you and me as far as it has any consciousness of our existence, and         
quite understands that what I write for you must pass at a                  
considerable height over its simple romantic head. It will take my          
books as read and my genius for granted, trusting me to put forth work      
of such quality as shall bear out its verdict. So we may disport            
ourselves on our own plane to the top of our bent; and if any               
gentleman points out that neither this epistle dedicatory nor the           
dream of Don Juan in the third act of the ensuing comedy is suitable        
for immediate production at a popular theatre we need not contradict        
him. Napoleon provided Talma with a pit of kings, with what effect          
on Talma's acting is not recorded. As for me, what I have always            
wanted is a pit of philosophers; and this is a play for such a pit.         
  I should make formal acknowledgment to the authors whom I have            
pillaged in the following pages if I could recollect them all. The          
theft of the brigand-poetaster from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is               
deliberate; and the metamorphosis of Leporello into Enry Straker,           
motor engineer and New Man, is an intentional dramatic sketch of the        
contemporary embryo of Mr H. G. Wells's anticipation of the                 
efficient engineering class which will, he hopes, finally sweep the         
jabberers out of the way of civilization. Mr Barrie has also, whilst I      
am correcting my proofs, delighted London with a servant who knows          
more than his masters. The conception of Mendoza Limited I trace            
back to a certain West Indian colonial secretary, who, at a period          
when he and I and Mr Sidney Webb were sowing our political wild oats        
as a sort of Fabian Three Musketeers, without any prevision of the          
surprising respectability of the crop that followed, recommended Webb,      
the encyclopedic and inexhaustible, to form himself into a company for      
the benefit of the shareholders. Octavius I take over unaltered from        
Mozart; and I hereby authorize any actor who impersonates him, to sing      
"Dalla sua pace" (if he can) at any convenient moment during the            
representation. Ann was suggested to me by the fifteenth century Dutch      
morality called Everyman, which Mr William Poel has lately                  
resuscitated so triumphantly. I trust he will work that vein                
further, and recognize that Elizabethan Renascence fustian is no            
more bearable after medieval poesy than Scribe after Ibsen. As I sat        
watching Everyman at the Charterhouse, I said to myself Why not             
Everywoman? Ann was the result: every woman is not Ann; but Ann is          
Everywoman.                                                                 
  That the author of Everyman was no mere artist, but an                    
artist-philosopher, and that the artist-philosophers are the only sort      
of artists I take quite seriously, will be no news to you. Even             
Plato and Boswell, as the dramatists who invented Socrates and Dr           
Johnson, impress me more deeply than the romantic playwrights. Ever         
since, as a boy, I first breathed the air of the transcendental             
regions at a performance of Mozart's Zauberflote, I have been proof         
against the garish splendors and alcoholic excitements of the ordinary      
stage combinations of Tappertitian romance with the police                  
intelligence. Bunyan, Blake, Hogarth, and Turner (these four apart and      
above all the English classics), Goethe, Shelley, Schopenhauer,             
Wagner, Ibsen, Morris, Tolstoy, and Nietzsche are among the writers         
whose peculiar sense of the world I recognize as more or less akin          
to my own. Mark the word peculiar. I read Dickens and Shakespear            
without shame or stint; but their pregnant observations and                 
demonstrations of life are not co-ordinated into any philosophy or          
religion: on the contrary, Dickens's sentimental assumptions are            
violently contradicted by his observations; and Shakespear's pessimism      
is only his wounded humanity. Both have the specific genius of the          
fictionist and the common sympathies of human feeling and thought in        
pre-eminent degree. They are often saner and shrewder than the              
philosophers just as Sancho-Panza was often saner and shrewder than         
Don Quixote. They clear away vast masses of oppressive gravity by           
their sense of the ridiculous, which is at bottom a combination of          
sound moral judgment with lighthearted good humor. But they are             
concerned with the diversities of the world instead of with its             
unities: they are so irreligious that they exploit popular religion         
for professional purposes without delicacy or scruple (for example,         
Sydney Carton and the ghost in Hamlet!): they are anarchical, and           
cannot balance their exposures of Angelo and Dogberry, Sir Leicester        
Dedlock and Mr Tite Barnacle, with any portrait of a prophet or a           
worthy leader: they have no constructive ideas: they regard those           
who have them as dangerous fanatics: in all their fictions there is no      
leading thought or inspiration for which any man could conceivably          
risk the spoiling of his hat in a shower, much less his life. Both are      
alike forced to borrow motives for the more strenuous actions of their      
personages from the common stockpot of melodramatic plots; so that          
Hamlet has to be stimulated by the prejudices of a policeman and            
Macbeth by the cupidities of a bushranger. Dickens, without the excuse      
of having to manufacture motives for Hamlets and Macbeths,                  
superfluously punts his crew down the stream of his monthly parts by        
mechanical devices which I leave you to describe, my own memory             
being quite baffled by the simplest question as to Monks in Oliver          
Twist, or the long lost parentage of Smike, or the relations between        
the Dorrit and Clennam families so inopportunely discovered by              
Monsieur Rigaud Blandois. The truth is, the world was to Shakespear         
a great "stage of fools" on which he was utterly bewildered. He             
could see no sort of sense in living at all; and Dickens saved himself      
from the despair of the dream in The Chimes by taking the world for         
granted and busying himself with its details. Neither of them could do      
anything with a serious positive character: they could place a human        
figure before you with perfect verisimilitude; but when the moment          
came for making it live and move, they found, unless it made them           
laugh, that they had a puppet on their hands, and had to invent some        
artificial external stimulus to make it work. This is what is the           
matter with Hamlet all through: he has no will except in his bursts of      
temper. Foolish Bardolaters make a virtue of this after their fashion:      
they declare that the play is the tragedy of irresolution; but all          
Shakespear's projections of the deepest humanity he knew have the same      
defect: their characters and manners are lifelike; but their actions        
are forced on them from without, and the external force is grotesquely      
inappropriate except when it is quite conventional, as in the case          
of Henry V. Falstaff is more vivid than any of these serious                
reflective characters, because he is self-acting: his motives are           
his own appetites and instincts and humors. Richard III, too, is            
delightful as the whimsical comedian who stops a funeral to make            
love to the corpse's son's widow; but when, in the next act, he is          
replaced by a stage villain who smothers babies and offs with people's      
heads, we are revolted at the imposture and repudiate the                   
changeling. Faulconbridge, Coriolanus, Leontes are admirable                
descriptions of instinctive temperaments: indeed the play of                
Coriolanus is the greatest of Shakespear's comedies; but description        
is not philosophy; and comedy neither compromises the author nor            
reveals him. He must be judged by those characters into which he            
puts what he knows of himself, his Hamlets and Macbeths and Lears           
and Prosperos. If these characters are agonizing in a void about            
factitious melodramatic murders and revenges and the like, whilst           
the comic characters walk with their feet on solid ground, vivid and        
amusing, you know that the author has much to shew and nothing to           
teach. The comparison between Falstaff and Prospero is like the             
comparison between Micawber and David Copperfield. At the end of the        
book you know Micawber, whereas you only know what has happened to          
David, and are not interested enough in him to wonder what his              
politics or religion might be if anything so stupendous as a religious      
or political idea, or a general idea of any sort, were to occur to          
him. He is tolerable as a child; but he never becomes a man, and might      
be left out of his own biography altogether but for his usefulness          
as a stage confidant, a Horatio or "Charles his friend": what they          
call on the stage a feeder.                                                 
  Now you cannot say this of the works of the artist-philosophers. You      
cannot say it, for instance, of The Pilgrim's Progress. Put your            
Shakespearian hero and coward, Henry V and Pistol or Parolles,              
beside Mr Valiant and Mr Fearing, and you have a sudden revelation          
of the abyss that lies between the fashionable author who could see         
nothing in the world but personal aims and the tragedy of their             
disappointment or the comedy of their incongruity, and the field            
preacher who achieved virtue and courage by identifying himself with        
the purpose of the world as he understood it. The contrast is               
enormous: Bunyan's coward stirs your blood more than Shakespear's           
hero, who actually leaves you cold and secretly hostile. You                
suddenly see that Shakespear, with all his flashes and divinations,         
never understood virtue and courage, never conceived how any man who        
was not a fool could, like Bunyan's hero, look back from the brink          
of the river of death over the strife and labor of his pilgrimage, and      
say "yet I do not repent me"; or, with the panache of a millionaire,        
bequeath "my sword to him that shall succeed me in my pilgrimage,           
and my courage and skill to him that can get it." This is the true joy      
in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a           
mighty one; the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the      
scrap heap; the being a force of Nature instead of a feverish               
selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the         
world will not devote itself to making you happy. And also the only         
real tragedy in life is the being used by personally minded men for         
purposes which you recognize to be base. All the rest is at worst mere      
misfortune or mortality: this alone is misery, slavery, hell on earth;      
and the revolt against it is the only force that offers a man's work        
to the poor artist, whom our personally minded rich people would so         
willingly employ as pandar, buffoon, beauty monger, sentimentalizer         
and the like.                                                               
  It may seem a long step from Bunyan to Nietzsche; but the difference      
between their conclusions is merely formal. Bunyan's perception that        
righteousness is filthy rags, his scorn for Mr Legality in the village      
of Morality, his defiance of the Church as the supplanter of religion,      
his insistence on courage as the virtue of virtues, his estimate of         
the career of the conventionally respectable and sensible Worldly           
Wiseman as no better at bottom than the life and death of Mr Badman:        
all this, expressed by Bunyan in the terms of a tinker's theology,          
is what Nietzsche has expressed in terms of post-Darwin,                    
post-Schopenhauer philosophy; Wagner in terms of polytheistic               
mythology; and Ibsen in terms of mid-XIX century Parisian                   
dramaturgy. Nothing is new in these matters except their novelties:         
for instance, it is a novelty to call Justification by Faith                
"Wille," and Justification by Works "Vorstellung." The sole use of the      
novelty is that you and I buy and read Schopenhauer's treatise on Will      
and Representation when we should not dream of buying a set of sermons      
on Faith versus Works. At bottom the controversy is the same, and           
the dramatic results are the same. Bunyan makes no attempt to               
present his pilgrims as more sensible or better conducted than Mr           
Worldly Wiseman. Mr W. W.'s worst enemies, Mr Embezzler, Mr                 
Never-go-to-Church-on-Sunday, Mr Bad Form, Mr Murderer, Mr Burglar, Mr      
Co-respondent, Mr Blackmailer, Mr Cad, Mr Drunkard, Mr Labor                
Agitator and so forth, can read the Pilgrim's Progress without finding      
a word said against them; whereas the respectable people who snub them      
and put them in prison, such as Mr W. W. himself and his young              
friend Civility; Formalist and Hypocrisy; Wildhead, Inconsiderate, and      
Pragmatick (who were clearly young university men of good family and        
high feeding); that brisk lad Ignorance, Talkative, By-ends of              
Fairspeech and his mother-in-law Lady Feigning, and other reputable         
gentlemen and citizens, catch it very severely. Even Little Faith,          
though he gets to heaven at last, is given to understand that it            
served him right to be mobbed by the brothers Faint Heart, Mistrust,        
and Guilt, all three recognized members of respectable society and          
veritable pillars of the law. The whole allegory is a consistent            
attack on morality and respectability, without a word that one can          
remember against vice and crime. Exactly what is complained of in           
Nietzsche and Ibsen, is it not? And also exactly what would be              
complained of in all the literature which is great enough and old           
enough to have attained canonical rank, officially or unofficially,         
were it not that books are admitted to the canon by a compact which         
confesses their greatness in consideration of abrogating their              
meaning; so that the reverend rector can agree with the prophet             
Micah as to his inspired style without being committed to any               
complicity in Micah's furiously Radical opinions. Why, even I, as I         
force myself, pen in hand, into recognition and civility, find all the      
force of my onslaught destroyed by a simple policy of                       
non-resistance. In vain do I redouble the violence of the language          
in which I proclaim my heterodoxies. I rail at the theistic                 
credulity of Voltaire, the amoristic superstition of Shelley, the           
revival of tribal soothsaying and idolatrous rites which Huxley called      
Science and mistook for an advance on the Pentateuch, no less than          
at the welter of ecclesiastical and professional humbug which saves         
the face of the stupid system of violence and robbery which we call         
Law and Industry. Even atheists reproach me with infidelity and             
anarchists with nihilism because I cannot endure their moral                
tirades. And yet, instead of exclaiming "Send this inconceivable            
Satanist to the stake," the respectable newspapers pith me by               
announcing "another book by this brilliant and thoughtful writer." And      
the ordinary citizen, knowing that an author who is well spoken of          
by a respectable newspaper must be all right, reads me, as he reads         
Micah, with undisturbed edification from his own point of view. It          
is narrated that in the eighteenseventies an old lady, a very devout        
Methodist, moved from Colchester to a house in the neighborhood of the      
City Road, in London, where, mistaking the Hall of Science for a            
chapel, she sat at the feet of Charles Bradlaugh for many years,            
entranced by his eloquence, without questioning his orthodoxy or            
moulting a feather of her faith. I fear I shall be defrauded of my          
just martyrdom in the same way.                                             
  However, I am digressing, as a man with a grievance always does. And      
after all, the main thing in determining the artistic quality of a          
book is not the opinions it propagates, but the fact that the writer        
has opinions. The old lady from Colchester was right to sun her simple      
soul in the energetic radiance of Bradlaugh's genuine beliefs and           
disbeliefs rather than in the chill of such mere painting of light and      
heat as elocution and convention can achieve. My contempt for               
*belles lettres,* and for amateurs who become the heroes of the             
fanciers of literary virtuosity, is not founded on any illusion of          
mine as to the permanence of those forms of thought (call them              
opinions) by which I strive to communicate my bent to my fellows. To        
younger men they are already outmoded; for though they have no more         
lost their logic than an eighteenth century pastel has lost its             
drawing or its color, yet, like the pastel, they grow indefinably           
shabby, and will grow shabbier until they cease to count at all,            
when my books will either perish, or, if the world is still poor            
enough to want them, will have to stand, with Bunyan's, by quite            
amorphous qualities of temper and energy. With this conviction I            
cannot be a belletrist. No doubt I must recognize, as even the Ancient      
Mariner did, that I must tell my story entertainingly if I am to            
hold the wedding guest spellbound in spite of the siren sounds of           
the loud bassoon. But "for art's sake" alone I would not face the toil      
of writing a single sentence. I know that there are men who, having         
nothing to say and nothing to write, are nevertheless so in love            
with oratory and with literature that they delight in repeating as          
much as they can understand of what others have said or written             
aforetime. I know that the leisurely tricks which their want of             
conviction leaves them free to play with the diluted and                    
misapprehended message supply them with a pleasant parlor game which        
they call style. I can pity their dotage and even sympathize with           
their fancy. But a true original style is never achieved for its own        
sake: a man may pay from a shilling to a guinea, according to his           
means, to see, hear, or read another man's act of genius; but he            
will not pay with his whole life and soul to become a mere virtuoso in      
literature, exhibiting an accomplishment which will not even make           
money for him, like fiddle playing. Effectiveness of assertion is           
the Alpha and Omega of style. He who has nothing to assert has no           
style and can have none: he who has something to assert will go as far      
in power of style as its momentousness and his conviction will carry        
him. Disprove his assertion after it is made, yet its style remains.        
Darwin has no more destroyed the style of Job nor of Handel than            
Martin Luther destroyed the style of Giotto. All the assertions get         
disproved sooner or later; and so we find the world full of a               
magnificent debris of artistic fossils, with the matter-of-fact             
credibility gone clean out of them, but the form still splendid. And        
that is why the old masters play the deuce with our mere susceptibles.      
Your Royal Academician thinks he can get the style of Giotto without        
Giotto's beliefs, and correct his perspective into the bargain. Your        
man of letters thinks he can get Bunyan's or Shakespear's style             
without Bunyan's conviction or Shakespear's apprehension, especially        
if he takes care not to split his infinitives. And so with your             
Doctors of Music, who, with their collections of discords duly              
prepared and resolved or retarded or anticipated in the manner of           
the great composers, think they can learn the art of Palestrina from        
Cherubini's treatise. All this academic art is far worse than the           
trade in sham antique furniture; for the man who sells me an oaken          
chest which he swears was made in the XIII century, though as a matter      
of fact he made it himself only yesterday, at least does not pretend        
that there are any modern ideas in it; whereas your academic copier of      
fossils offers them to you as the latest outpouring of the human            
spirit, and, worst of all, kidnaps young people as pupils and               
persuades them that his limitations are rules, his observances              
dexterities, his timidities good taste, and his emptinesses                 
purities. And when he declares that art should not be didactic, all         
the people who have nothing to teach and all the people who dont            
want to learn agree with him emphatically.                                  
  I pride myself on not being one of these susceptibles. If you             
study the electric light with which I supply you in that                    
Bumbledonian public capacity of mine over which you make merry from         
time to time, you will find that your house contains a great                
quantity of highly susceptible copper wire which gorges itself with         
electricity and gives you no light whatever. But here and there occurs      
a scrap of intensely insusceptible, intensely resistant material;           
and that stubborn scrap grapples with the current and will not let          
it through until it has made itself useful to you as those two vital        
qualities of literature, light and heat. Now if I am to be no mere          
copper wire amateur but a luminous author, I must also be a most            
intensely refractory person, liable to go out and to go wrong at            
inconvenient moments, and with incendiary possibilities. These are the      
faults of my qualities; and I assure you that I sometimes dislike           
myself so much that when some irritable reviewer chances at that            
moment to pitch into me with zest, I feel unspeakably relieved and          
obliged. But I never dream of reforming, knowing that I must take           
myself as I am and get what work I can out of myself. All this you          
will understand; for there is community of material between us: we are      
both critics of life as well as of art; and you have perhaps said to        
yourself when I have passed your windows "There, but for the grace          
of God, go I." An awful and chastening reflection, which shall be           
the closing cadence of this immoderately long letter from yours             
faithfully,                                                                 

                                                 G. BERNARD SHAW            
  WOKING, 1903                                                              

  P.S.- Amid unprecedented critical cerebration over this book of           
ours- alas! that your own voice should be dedicated to silence!- I          
find myself warned to prepare a new edition. I take the opportunity to      
correct a slip or two. You may have noticed (nobody else has, by the        
way) that I fitted you with a quotation from Othello, and then              
unconsciously referred it to A Winter's Tale. I correct this with           
regret; for half its appropriateness goes with Florizel and Perdita:        
still, one must not trifle with Shakespear; so I have given                 
Desdemona back her property.                                                
  On the whole, the book has done very well. The strong critics are         
impressed; the weak intimidated; the connoisseurs tickled by my             
literary bravura (put in to please you): the humorists alone, oddly         
enough, sermonize me, scared out of their profession into the               
quaintest tumults of conscience. Not all my reviewers have                  
understood me: like Englishmen in France, confidently uttering their        
own island diphthongs as good French vowels, many of them offer, as         
samples of the Shavian philosophy, the likest article from their own        
stock. Others are the victims of association of ideas: they call me         
Pessimist because my remarks wound their self-complacency, and              
Renegade because I would have my mob all Caesars instead of Toms,           
Dicks, and Harrys. Worst of all, I have been accused of preaching a         
Final Ethical Superman: no other, in fact, than our friend the Just         
Man made Perfect! This misunderstanding is so galling that I lay            
down my pen without another word lest I should be tempted to make           
the postcript longer even than the letter.                                  


                               ACT ONE                                      

  ROEBUCK RAMSDEN is in his study, opening the morning's letters.           
The study, handsomely and solidly furnished, proclaims the man of           
means. Not a speck of dust is visible: it is clear that there are at        
least two housemaids and a parlormaid downstairs, and a housekeeper         
upstairs who does not let them spare elbow-grease. Even the top of          
Roebuck's head is polished: on a sunshiny day he could heliograph           
his orders to distant camps by merely nodding. In no other respect,         
however, does he suggest the military man. It is in active civil            
life that men get his broad air of importance, his dignified                
expectation of deference, his determinate mouth disarmed and refined        
since the hour of his success by the withdrawal of opposition and           
the concession of comfort and precedence and power. He is more than         
a highly respectable man: he is marked out as a president of highly         
respectable men, a chairman among directors, an alderman among              
councillors, a mayor among aldermen. Four tufts of iron-grey hair,          
which will soon be as white as isinglass, and are in other respects         
not at all unlike it, grow in two symmetrical pairs above his ears and      
at the angles of his spreading jaws. He wears a black frock coat, a         
white waistcoat (it is bright spring weather), and trousers, neither        
black nor perceptibly blue, of one of those indefinitely mixed hues         
which the modern clothier has produced to harmonize with the religions      
of respectable men. He has not been out of doors yet today; so he           
still wears his slippers, his boots being ready for him on the              
hearthrug. Surmising that he has no valet, and seeing that he has no        
secretary with a shorthand notebook and a typewriter, one meditates on      
how little our great burgess domesticity has been disturbed by new          
fashions and methods, or by the enterprise of the railway and hotel         
companies which sell you a Saturday to Monday of life at Folkestone as      
a real gentleman for two guineas, first class fares both ways               
included.                                                                   
  How old is Roebuck? The question is important on the threshold of         
a drama of ideas; for under such circumstances everything depends on        
whether his adolescence belonged to the sixties or to the eighties. He      
was born, as a matter of fact, in 1839, and was a Unitarian and Free        
Trader from his boyhood, and an Evolutionist from the publication of        
the Origin of Species. Consequently he has always classed himself as        
an advanced thinker and fearlessly outspoken reformer.                      
  Sitting at his writing table, he has on his right the windows giving      
on Portland Place. Through these, as through a proscenium, the curious      
spectator may contemplate his profile as well as the blinds will            
permit. On his left is the inner wall, with a stately bookcase, and         
the door not quite in the middle, but somewhat further from him.            
Against the wall opposite him are two busts on pillars: one, to his         
left, of John Bright; the other, to his right, of Mr Herbert                
Spencer. Between them hang an engraved portrait of Richard Cobden;          
enlarged photographs of Martineau, Huxley, and George Eliot; autotypes      
of allegories by Mr G. F. Watts (for Roebuck believes in the fine arts      
with all the earnestness of a man who does not understand them), and        
an impression of Dupont's engraving of Delaroche's Beaux Arts               
hemicycle, representing the great men of all ages. On the wall              
behind him, above the mantel-shelf, is a family Portrait of                 
impenetrable obscurity.                                                     
  A chair stands near the writing table for the convenience of              
business visitors. Two other chairs are against the wall between the        
busts.                                                                      
  A parlormaid enters with a visitor's card. Roebuck takes it, and          
nods, pleased. Evidently a welcome caller.                                  

  RAMSDEN. Shew him in.                                                     

    The parlormaid goes out and returns with the visitor.                   

  THE MAID. Mr Robinson.                                                    

    Mr Robinson is really an uncommonly nice looking young fellow.          
He must, one thinks, be the jeune premier; for it is not in reason          
to suppose that a second such attractive male figure should appear          
in one story. The slim, shapely frame, the elegant suit of new              
mourning, the small head and regular features, the pretty little            
moustache, the frank clear eyes, the wholesome bloom on the youthful        
complexion, the well brushed glossy hair, not curly, but of fine            
texture and good dark color, the arch of good nature in the                 
eyebrows, the erect forehead and neatly pointed chin, all announce the      
man who will love and suffer later on. And that he will not do so           
without sympathy is guaranteed by an engaging sincerity and eager           
modest serviceableness which stamp him as a man of amiable nature. The      
moment he appears, Ramsden's face expands into fatherly liking and          
welcome, an expression which drops into one of decorous grief as the        
young man approaches him with sorrow in his face as well as in his          
black clothes. Ramsden seems to know the nature of the bereavement. As      
the visitor advances silently to the writing table, the old man             
rises and shakes his hand across it without a word: a long,                 
affectionate shake which tells the story of a recent sorrow common          
to both.                                                                    

  RAMSDEN [concluding the handshake and cheering up] Well, well,            
      Octavius, it's the common lot. We must all face it some day.          
      Sit down.                                                             

    Octavius takes the visitor's chair. Ramsden replaces himself in         
his own.                                                                    

  OCTAVIUS. Yes: we must face it, Mr Ramsden. But I owed him a great        
      deal. He did everything for me that my father could have done         
      if he had lived.                                                      
  RAMSDEN. He had no son of his own, you see.                               
  OCTAVIUS. But he had daughters; and yet he was as good to my sister       
      as to me. And his death was so sudden! I always intended to           
      thank him- to let him know that I had not taken all his care of       
      me as a matter of course, as any boy takes his father's care.         
      But I waited for an opportunity; and now he is dead- dropped          
      without a moment's warning. He will never know what I felt. [He       
      takes out his handkerchief and cries unaffectedly].                   
  RAMSDEN. How do we know that, Octavius? He may know it: we cannot         
      tell. Come! dont grieve. [Octavius masters himself and puts up        
      his handkerchief]. Thats right. Now let me tell you something         
      to console you. The last time I saw him- it was in this very          
      room- he said to me: "Tavy is a generous lad and the soul of          
      honor; and when I see how little consideration other men get          
      from their sons, I realize how much better than a son he's been       
      to me." There! Doesnt that do you good?                               
  OCTAVIUS. Mr Ramsden: he used to say to me that he had met only one       
      man in the world who was the soul of honor, and that was              
      Roebuck Ramsden.                                                      
  RAMSDEN. Oh, that was his partiality: we were very old friends, you       
      know. But there was something else he used to say about you. I        
      wonder whether I ought to tell you or not!                            
  OCTAVIUS. You know best.                                                  
  RAMSDEN. It was something about his daughter.                             
  OCTAVIUS [eagerly] About Ann! Oh, do tell me that, Mr Ramsden.            
  RAMSDEN. Well, he said he was glad, after all, you were not his           
      son, because he thought that someday Annie and you- [Octavius         
      blushes vividly]. Well, perhaps I shouldnt have told you. But         
      he was in earnest.                                                    
  OCTAVIUS. Oh, if only I thought I had a chance! You know, Mr              
      Ramsden, I dont care about money or about what people call            
      position; and I cant bring myself to take an interest in the          
      business of struggling for them. Well, Ann has a most exquisite       
      nature; but she is so accustomed to be in the thick of that           
      sort of thing that she thinks a man's character incomplete if         
      he is not ambitious. She knows that if she married me she would       
      have to reason herself out of being ashamed of me for not being       
      a big success of some kind.                                           
  RAMSDEN [getting up and planting himself with his back to the             
      fireplace] Nonsense, my boy, nonsense! Youre too modest. What         
      does she know about the real value of men at her age? [More           
      seriously] Besides, she's a wonderfully dutiful girl. Her             
      father's wish would be sacred to her. Do you know that since          
      she grew up to years of discretion, I dont believe she has ever       
      once given her own wish as a reason for doing anything or not         
      doing it. It's always "Father wishes me to," or "Mother wouldnt       
      like it." It's really almost a fault in her. I have often told        
      her she must learn to think for herself.                              
  OCTAVIUS [shaking his head] I couldnt ask her to marry me because         
      her father wished it, Mr Ramsden.                                     
  RAMSDEN. Well, perhaps not. No: of course not. I see that. No: you        
      certainly couldnt. But when you win her on your own merits, it        
      will be a great happiness to her to fulfil her father's desire        
      as well as her own. Eh? Come! youll ask her, wont you?                
  OCTAVIUS [with sad gaiety] At all events I promise you I shall            
      never ask anyone else.                                                
  RAMSDEN. Oh, you shant need to. She'll accept you, my boy- although       
      [here he suddenly becomes very serious indeed] you have one           
      great drawback.                                                       
  OCTAVIUS [anxiously] What drawback is that, Mr Ramsden? I should          
      rather say which of my many drawbacks?                                
  RAMSDEN. I'll tell you, Octavius. [He takes from the table a book         
      bound in red cloth]. I have in my hand a copy of the most             
      infamous, the most scandalous, the most mischievous, the most         
      blackguardly book that ever escaped burning at the hands of the       
      common hangman. I have not read it: I would not soil my mind          
      with such filth; but I have read what the papers say of it. The       
      title is quite enough for me. [He reads it]. The Revolutionist's      
      Handbook and Pocket Companion. By John Tanner, M.I.R.C., Member       
      of the Idle Rich Class.                                               
  OCTAVIUS [smiling] But Jack-                                              
  RAMSDEN [testily] For goodness' sake, dont call him Jack under my         
      roof [he throws the book violently down on the table. Then,           
      somewhat relieved, he comes past the table to Octavius, and           
      addresses him at close quarters with impressive gravity]. Now,        
      Octavius, I know that my dead friend was right when he said you       
      were a generous lad. I know that this man was your schoolfellow,      
      and that you feel bound to stand by him because there was a           
      boyish friendship between you. But I ask you to consider the          
      altered circumstances. You were treated as a son in my friend's       
      house. You lived there; and your friends could not be turned          
      from the door. This man Tanner was in and out there on your           
      account almost from his childhood. He addresses Annie by her          
      Christian name as freely as you do. Well, while her father was        
      alive, that was her father's business, not mine. This man Tanner      
      was only a boy to him: his opinions were something to be laughed      
      at, like a man's hat on a child's head. But now Tanner is a           
      grown man and Annie a grown woman. And her father is gone. We         
      dont as yet know the exact terms of his will; but he often            
      talked it over with me; and I have no more doubt than I have          
      that youre sitting there that the will appoints me Annie's            
      trustee and guardian. [Forcibly] Now I tell you, once for all,        
      I cant and I wont have Annie placed in such a position that she       
      must, out of regard for you, suffer the intimacy of this fellow       
      Tanner. It's not fair: it's not right: it's not kind. What are        
      you going to do about it?                                             
  OCTAVIUS. But Ann herself has told Jack that whatever his opinions        
      are, he will always be welcome because he knew her dear father.       
  RAMSDEN [out of patience] That girl's mad about her duty to her           
      parents. [He starts off like a goaded ox in the direction of          
      John Bright, in whose expression there is no sympathy for him.        
      As he speaks he fumes down to Herbert Spencer, who receives him       
      still more coldly]. Excuse me, Octavius; but there are limits         
      to social toleration. You know that I am not a bigoted or             
      prejudiced man. You know that I am plain Roebuck Ramsden when         
      other men who have done less have got handles to their names,         
      because I have stood for equality and liberty of conscience           
      while they were truckling to the Church and to the aristocracy.       
      Whitefield and I lost chance after chance through our advanced        
      opinions. But I draw the line at Anarchism and Free Love and          
      that sort of thing. If I am to be Annie's guardian, she will          
      have to learn that she has a duty to me. I wont have it: I will       
      not have it. She must forbid John Tanner the house; and so must       
      you.                                                                  

    The parlormaid returns.                                                 

  OCTAVIUS. But-                                                            
  RAMSDEN [calling his attention to the servant] Ssh! Well?                 
  THE MAID. Mr Tanner wishes to see you, sir.                               
  RAMSDEN. Mr Tanner!                                                       
  OCTAVIUS. Jack!                                                           
  RAMSDEN. How dare Mr Tanner call on me! Say I cannot see him.             
  OCTAVIUS [hurt] I am sorry you are turning my friend from your door       
      like that.                                                            
  THE MAID [calmly] He's not at the door, sir. He's upstairs in the         
      drawing room with Miss Ramsden. He came with Mrs Whitefield and       
      Miss Ann and Miss Robinson, sir.                                      

    Ramsden's feelings are beyond words.                                    

  OCTAVIUS [grinning] Thats very like Jack, Mr Ramsden. You must see        
      him, even if it's only to turn him out.                               
  RAMSDEN. [hammering out his words with suppressed fury] Go upstairs       
      and ask Mr Tanner to be good enough to step down here. [The           
      parlormaid goes out; and Ramsden returns to the fireplace, as         
      to a fortified position]. I must say that of all the confounded       
      pieces of impertinence- well, if these are Anarchist manners, I       
      hope you like them. And Annie with him! Annie! A- [he chokes].        
  OCTAVIUS. Yes: thats what surprises me. He's so desperately afraid        
      of Ann. There must be something the matter.                           

    Mr John Tanner suddenly opens the door and enters. He is too young      
to be described simply as a big man with a beard. But it is already         
plain that middle life will find him in that category. He has still         
some of the slimness of youth; but youthfulness is not the effect he        
aims at: his frock coat would befit a prime minister; and a certain         
high chested carriage of the shoulders, a lofty pose of the head,           
and the Olympian majesty with which a mane, or rather a huge wisp,          
of hazel colored hair is thrown back from an imposing brow, suggest         
Jupiter rather than Apollo. He is prodigiously fluent of speech,            
restless, excitable (mark the snorting nostril and the restless blue        
eye, just the thirty-secondth of an inch too wide open), possibly a         
little mad. He is carefully dressed, not from the vanity that cannot        
resist finery, but from a sense of the importance of everything he          
does which leads him to make as much of paying a call as other men          
do of getting married or laying a foundation stone. A sensitive,            
susceptible, exaggerative, earnest man: a megalomaniac, who would be        
lost without a sense of humor.                                              
  Just at present the sense of humor is in abeyance. To say that he is      
excited is nothing: all his moods are phases of excitement. He is           
now in the panic-stricken phase; and he walks straight up to Ramsden        
as if with the fixed intention of shooting him on his own hearthrug.        
But what he pulls from his breast pocket is not a pistol, but a             
foolscap document which he thrusts under the indignant nose of Ramsden      
as he exclaims                                                              

  TANNER. Ramsden: do you know what that is?                                
  RAMSDEN. [loftily] No, sir.                                               
  TANNER. It's a copy of Whitefield's will. Ann got it this morning.        
  RAMSDEN. When you say Ann, you mean, I presume, Miss Whitefield.          
  TANNER. I mean our Ann, your Ann, Tavy's Ann, and now, heaven help        
      me, my Ann!                                                           
  OCTAVIUS [rising, very pale] What do you mean?                            
  TANNER. Mean! [He holds up the will]. Do you know who is appointed        
      Ann's guardian by this will?                                          
  RAMSDEN [coolly] I believe I am.                                          
  TANNER. You! You and I, man. I! I!! I!!! Both of us! [He flings the       
      will down on the writing table].                                      
  RAMSDEN. You! Impossible.                                                 
  TANNER. It's only too hideously true. [He throws himself into             
      Octavius's chair]. Ramsden: get me out of it somehow. You dont        
      know Ann as well as I do. She'll commit every crime a                 
      respectable woman can; and she'll justify every one of them by        
      saying that it was the wish of her guardians. She'll put              
      everything on us; and we shall have no more control over her          
      than a couple of mice over a cat.                                     
  OCTAVIUS. Jack: I wish you wouldnt talk like that about Ann.              
  TANNER. This chap's in love with her: thats another complication.         
      Well, she'll either jilt him and say I didnt approve of him, or       
      marry him and say you ordered her to. I tell you, this is the         
      most staggering blow that has ever fallen on a man of my age and      
      temperament.                                                          
  RAMSDEN. Let me see that will, sir. [He goes to the writing table         
      and picks it up]. I cannot believe that my old friend Whitefield      
      would have shewn such a want of confidence in me as to associate      
      me with- [His countenance falls as he reads].                         
  TANNER. It's all my own doing: thats the horrible irony of it. He         
      told me one day that you were to be Ann's guardian; and like a        
      fool I began arguing with him about the folly of leaving a young      
      woman under the control of an old man with obsolete ideas.            
  RAMSDEN [stupended] My ideas obsolete!!!!!!!                              
  TANNER. Totally. I had just finished an essay called Down with            
      Government by the Greyhaired; and I was full of arguments and         
      illustrations. I said the proper thing was to combine the             
      experience of an old hand with the vitality of a young one. Hang      
      me if he didnt take me at my word and alter his will- it's dated      
      only a fortnight after that conversation- appointing me as joint      
      guardian with you!                                                    
  RAMSDEN [pale and determined] I shall refuse to act.                      
  TANNER. Whats the good of that? Ive been refusing all the way from        
      Richmond; but Ann keeps on saying that of course she's only an        
      orphan; and that she cant expect the people who were glad to          
      come to the house in her father's time to trouble much about her      
      now. Thats the latest game. An orphan! It's like hearing an           
      ironclad talk about being at the mercy of the wind and waves.         
  OCTAVIUS. This is not fair, Jack. She is an orphan. And you ought to      
      stand by her.                                                         
  TANNER. Stand by her! What danger is she in? She has the law on her       
      side; she has popular sentiment on her side; she has plenty of        
      money and no conscience. All she wants with me is to load up all      
      her moral responsibilities on me, and do as she likes at the          
      expense of my character. I cant control her; and she can              
      compromise me as much as she likes. I might as well be her            
      husband.                                                              
  RAMSDEN. You can refuse to accept the guardianship. *I* shall             
      certainly refuse to hold it jointly with you.                         
  TANNER. Yes; and what will she say to that? what does she say to it?      
      Just that her father's wishes are sacred to her, and that she         
      shall always look up to me as her guardian whether I care to          
      face the responsibility or not. Refuse! You might as well refuse      
      to accept the embraces of a boa constrictor when once it gets         
      round your neck.                                                      
  OCTAVIUS. This sort of talk is not kind to me, Jack.                      
  TANNER [rising and going to Octavius to console him, but still            
      lamenting] If he wanted a young guardian, why didnt he appoint        
      Tavy?                                                                 
  RAMSDEN. Ah! why indeed?                                                  
  OCTAVIUS. I will tell you. He sounded me about it; but I refused the      
      trust because I loved her. I had no right to let myself be            
      forced on her as a guardian by her father. He spoke to her about      
      it; and she said I was right. You know I love her, Mr Ramsden;        
      and Jack knows it too. If Jack loved a woman, I would not             
      compare her to a boa constrictor in his presence, however much        
      I might dislike her [he sits down between the busts and turns         
      his face to the wall].                                                
  RAMSDEN. I do not believe that Whitefield was in his right senses         
      when he made that will. You have admitted that he made it under       
      your influence.                                                       
  TANNER. You ought to be pretty well obliged to me for my influence.       
      He leaves you two thousand five hundred for your trouble. He          
      leaves Tavy a dowry for his sister and five thousand for              
      himself.                                                              
  OCTAVIUS [his tears flowing afresh] Oh, I cant take it. He was too        
      good to us.                                                           
  TANNER. You wont get it, my boy, if Ramsden upsets the will.              
  RAMSDEN. Ha! I see. You have got me in a cleft stick.                     
  TANNER. He leaves me nothing but the charge of Ann's morals, on the       
      ground that I have already more money than is good for me. That       
      shews that he had his wits about him, doesnt it?                      
  RAMSDEN [grimly] I admit that.                                            
  OCTAVIUS [rising and coming from his refuge by the wall] Mr Ramsden:      
      I think you are prejudiced against Jack. He is a man of honor,        
      and incapable of abusing-                                             
  TANNER. Dont, Tavy: youll make me ill. I am not a man of honor: I am      
      a man struck down by a dead hand. Tavy: you must marry her after      
      all and take her off my hands. And I had set my heart on saving       
      you from her!                                                         
  OCTAVIUS. Oh, Jack, you talk of saving me from my highest happiness.      
  TANNER. Yes, a lifetime of happiness. If it were only the first half      
      hour's happiness, Tavy, I would buy it for you with my last           
      penny. But a lifetime of happiness! No man alive could bear it:       
      it would be hell on earth.                                            
  RAMSDEN [violently] Stuff, sir. Talk sense; or else go and waste          
      someone else's time: I have something better to do than listen        
      to your fooleries [he positively kicks his way to his table and       
      resumes his seat].                                                    
  TANNER. You hear him, Tavy! Not an idea in his head later than            
      eighteensixty. We cant leave Ann with no other guardian to turn       
      to.                                                                   
  RAMSDEN. I am proud of your contempt for my character and opinions,       
      sir. Your own are set forth in that book, I believe.                  
  TANNER [eagerly going to the table] What! Youve got my book! What do      
      you think of it?                                                      
  RAMSDEN. Do you suppose I would read such a book, sir?                    
  TANNER. Then why did you buy it?                                          
  RAMSDEN. I did not buy it, sir. It has been sent me by some foolish       
      lady who seems to admire your views. I was about to dispose of        
      it when Octavius interrupted me. I shall do so now, with your         
      permission. [He throws the book into the waste paper basket with      
      such vehemence that Tanner recoils under the impression that it       
      is being thrown at his head].                                         
  TANNER. You have no more manners than I have myself. However, that        
      saves ceremony between us. [He sits down again]. What do you          
      intend to do about this will?                                         
  OCTAVIUS. May I make a suggestion?                                        
  RAMSDEN. Certainly, Octavius.                                             
  OCTAVIUS. Arnt we forgetting that Ann herself may have some wishes        
      in this matter?                                                       
  RAMSDEN. I quite intend that Annie's wishes shall be consulted in         
      every reasonable way. But she is only a woman, and a young and        
      inexperienced woman at that.                                          
  TANNER. Ramsden: I begin to pity you.                                     
  RAMSDEN [hotly] I dont want to know how you feel towards me, Mr           
      Tanner.                                                               
  TANNER. Ann will do just exactly what she likes. And whats more,          
      she'll force us to advise her to do it; and she'll put the blame      
      on us if it turns out badly. So, as Tavy is longing to see her-       
  OCTAVIUS [shyly] I am not, Jack.                                          
  TANNER. You lie, Tavy: you are. So lets have her down from the            
      drawing room and ask her what she intends us to do. Off with          
      you, Tavy, and fetch her. [Tavy turns to go]. And dont be long;       
      for the strained relations between myself and Ramsden will make       
      the interval rather painful. [Ramsden compresses his lips, but        
      says nothing].                                                        
  OCTAVIUS. Never mind him, Mr Ramsden. He's not serious. [He goes          
      out].                                                                 
  RAMSDEN [very deliberately] Mr Tanner: you are the most impudent          
      person I have ever met.                                               
  TANNER [seriously] I know it, Ramsden. Yet even I cannot wholly           
      conquer shame. We live in an atmosphere of shame. We are ashamed      
      of everything that is real about us; ashamed of ourselves, of         
      our relatives, of our incomes, of our accents, of our opinions,       
      of our experience, just as we are ashamed of our naked skins.         
      Good Lord, my dear Ramsden, we are ashamed to walk, ashamed to        
      ride in an omnibus, ashamed to hire a hansom instead of keeping       
      a carriage, ashamed of keeping one horse instead of two and a         
      groom-gardener instead of a coachman and footman. The more            
      things a man is ashamed of, the more respectable he is. Why,          
      youre ashamed to buy my book, ashamed to read it: the only thing      
      youre not ashamed of is to judge me for it without having read        
      it; and even that only means that youre ashamed to have               
      heterodox opinions. Look at the effect I produce because my           
      fairy godmother withheld from me this gift of shame. I have           
      every possible virtue that a man can have except-                     
  RAMSDEN. I am glad you think so well of yourself.                         
  TANNER. All you mean by that is that you think I ought to be ashamed      
      of talking about my virtues. You dont mean that I havnt got           
      them: you know perfectly well that I am as sober and honest a         
      citizen as yourself, as truthful personally, and much more            
      truthful politically and morally.                                     
  RAMSDEN [touched on his most sensitive point] I deny that. I will         
      not allow you or any man to treat me as if I were a mere member       
      of the British public. I detest its prejudices; I scorn its           
      narrowness; I demand the right to think for myself. You pose as       
      an advanced man. Let me tell you that I was an advanced man           
      before you were born.                                                 
  TANNER. I knew it was a long time ago.                                    
  RAMSDEN. I am as advanced as ever I was. I defy you to prove that I       
      have ever hauled down the flag. I am more advanced than ever I        
      was. I grow more advanced every day.                                  
  TANNER. More advanced in years, Polonius.                                 
  RAMSDEN. Polonius! So you are Hamlet, I suppose.                          
  TANNER. No: I am only the most impudent person youve ever met. Thats      
      your notion of a thoroughly bad character. When you want to give      
      me a piece of your mind, you ask yourself, as a just and upright      
      man, what is the worst you can fairly say to me. Thief, liar,         
      forger, adulterer, perjurer, glutton, drunkard? Not one of these      
      names fits me. You have to fall back on my deficiency in shame.       
      Well, I admit it. I even congratulate myself; for if I were           
      ashamed of my real self, I should cut as stupid a figure as any       
      of the rest of you. Cultivate a little impudence, Ramsden; and        
      you will become quite a remarkable man.                               
  RAMSDEN. I have no-                                                       
  TANNER. You have no desire for that sort of notoriety. Bless you, I       
      knew that answer would come as well as I know that a box of           
      matches will come out of an automatic machine when I put a penny      
      in the slot: you would be ashamed to say anything else.               

    The crushing retort for which Mr Ramsden has been visibly               
collecting his forces is lost for ever; for at this point Octavius          
returns with Miss Ann Whitefield and her mother; and Ramsden springs        
up and hurries to the door to receive them. Whether Ann is                  
good-looking or not depends upon your taste; also and perhaps               
chiefly on your age and sex. To Octavius she is an enchantingly             
beautiful woman, in whose presence the world becomes transfigured, and      
the puny limits of individual consciousness are suddenly made infinite      
by a mystic memory of the whole life of the race to its beginnings          
in the east, or even back to the paradise from which it fell. She is        
to him the reality of romance, the inner good sense of nonsense, the        
unveiling of his eyes, the freeing of his soul, the abolition of time,      
place, and circumstance, the etherealization of his blood into              
rapturous rivers of the very water of life itself, the revelation of        
all the mysteries and the sanctification of all the dogmas. To her          
mother she is, to put it as moderately as possible, nothing whatever        
of the kind. Not that Octavius's admiration is in any way ridiculous        
or discreditable. Ann is a well formed creature, as far as that             
goes; and she is perfectly ladylike, graceful, and comely, with             
ensnaring eyes and hair. Besides, instead of making herself an              
eyesore, like her mother, she has devised a mourning costume of             
black and violet silk which does honor to her late father and               
reveals the family tradition of brave unconventionality by which            
Ramsden sets such store.                                                    
    But all this is beside the point as an explanation of Ann's charm.      
Turn up her nose, give a cast to her eye, replace her black and violet      
confection by the apron and feathers of a flower girl, strike all           
the aitches out of her speech, and Ann would still make men dream.          
Vitality is as common as humanity; but, like humanity, it sometimes         
rises to genius; and Ann is one of the vital geniuses. Not at all,          
if you please, an oversexed person: that is a vital defect, not a true      
excess. She is a perfectly respectable, perfectly self-controlled           
woman, and looks it; though her pose is fashionably frank and               
impulsive. She inspires confidence as a person who will do nothing she      
does not mean to do; also some fear, perhaps, as a woman who will           
probably do everything she means to do without taking more account          
of other people than may be necessary and what she calls right. In          
short, what the weaker of her own sex sometimes call a cat.                 
    Nothing can be more decorous than her entry and her reception by        
Ramsden, whom she kisses. The late Mr Whitefield would be gratified         
almost to impatience by the long faces of the men (except Tanner,           
who is fidgety), the silent handgrasps, the sympathetic placing of          
chairs, the sniffing of the widow, and the liquid eye of the daughter,      
whose heart, apparently will not let her control her tongue to speech.      
Ramsden and Octavius take the two chairs from the wall, and place them      
for the two ladies; but Ann comes to Tanner and takes his chair, which      
he offers with a brusque gesture, subsequently relieving his                
irritation by sitting down on the corner of the writing table with          
studied indecorum. Octavius gives Mrs Whitefield a chair next Ann, and      
himself takes the vacant one which Ramsden has placed under the nose        
of the effigy of Mr Herbert Spencer.                                        
  Mrs Whitefield, by the way, is a little woman, whose faded flaxen         
hair looks like straw on an egg. She has an expression of muddled           
shrewdness, a squeak of protest in her voice, and an odd air of             
continually elbowing away some larger person who is crushing her            
into a corner. One guesses her as one of those women who are conscious      
of being treated as silly and negligible, and who, without having           
strength enough to assert themselves effectually, at any rate never         
submit to their fate. There is a touch of chivalry in Octavius's            
scrupulous attention to her, even whilst his whole soul is absorbed by      
Ann.                                                                        
    Ramsden goes solemnly back to his magisterial seat at the               
writing table, ignoring Tanner, and opens the proceedings.                  

  RAMSDEN. I am sorry, Annie, to force business on you at a sad time        
      like the present. But your poor dear father's will has raised a       
      very serious question. You have read it, I believe?                   

    Ann assents with a nod and a catch of her breath, too much              
affected to speak.                                                          

      I must say I am surprised to find Mr Tanner named as joint            
      guardian and trustee with myself of you and Rhoda. [A pause.          
      They all look portentous; but they have nothing to say. Ramsden,      
      a little ruffled by the lack of any responses, continues] I dont      
      know that I can consent to act under such conditions. Mr Tanner       
      has, I understand, some objection also; but I do not profess to       
      understand its nature: he will no doubt speak for himself. But        
      we are agreed that we can decide nothing until we know your           
      views. I am afraid I shall have to ask you to choose between my       
      sole guardianship and that of Mr Tanner; for I fear it is             
      impossible for us to undertake a joint arrangement.                   
  ANN [in a low musical voice] Mamma-                                       
  MRS WHITEFIELD [hastily] Now, Ann, I do beg you not to put it on          
      me. I have no opinion on the subject; and if I had, it would          
      probably not be attended to. I am quite content with whatever         
      you three think best.                                                 

    Tanner turns his head and looks fixedly at Ramsden, who angrily         
refuses to receive this mute communication.                                 

  ANN [resuming in the same gentle voice, ignoring her mother's bad         
      taste] Mamma knows that she is not strong enough to bear the          
      whole responsibility for me and Rhoda without some help and           
      advice. Rhoda must have a guardian; and though I am older, I do       
      not think any young unmarried woman should be left quite to her       
      own guidance. I hope you agree with me, Granny?                       
  TANNER [starting] Granny! Do you intend to call your guardians            
      Granny?                                                               
  ANN. Dont be foolish, Jack. Mr Ramsden has always been Grandpapa          
      Roebuck to me: I am Granny's Annie; and he is Annie's Granny. I       
      christened him so when I first learned to speak.                      
  RAMSDEN [sarcastically] I hope you are satisfied, Mr Tanner. Go on,       
      Annie: I quite agree with you.                                        
  ANN. Well, if I am to have a guardian, can I set aside anybody whom       
      my dear father appointed for me?                                      
  RAMSDEN [biting his lip] You approve of your father's choice, then?       
  ANN. It is not for me to approve or disapprove. I accept it. My           
      father loved me and knew best what was good for me.                   
  RAMSDEN. Of course I understand your feeling, Annie. It is what I         
      should have expected of you; and it does you credit. But it does      
      not settle the question so completely as you think. Let me put        
      a case to you. Suppose you were to discover that I had been           
      guilty of some disgraceful action- that I was not the man your        
      poor dear father took me for! Would you still consider it right       
      that I should be Rhoda's guardian?                                    
  ANN. I cant imagine you doing anything disgraceful, Granny.               
  TANNER [to Ramsden] You havnt done anything of the sort, have you?        
  RAMSDEN [indignantly] No, sir.                                            
  MRS WHITEFIELD [placidly] Well, then, why suppose it?                     
  ANN. You see, Granny, Mamma would not like me to suppose it.              
  RAMSDEN [much perplexed] You are both so full of natural and              
      affectionate feeling in these family matters that it is very          
      hard to put the situation fairly before you.                          
  TANNER. Besides, my friend, you are not putting the situation fairly      
      before them.                                                          
  RAMSDEN [sulkily] Put it yourself, then.                                  
  TANNER. I will. Ann: Ramsden thinks I am not fit to be your               
      guardian; and I quite agree with him. He considers that if your       
      father had read my book, he wouldnt have appointed me. That book      
      is the disgraceful action he has been talking about. He thinks        
      it's your duty for Rhoda's sake to ask him to act alone and to        
      make me withdraw. Say the word; and I will.                           
  ANN. But I havnt read your book, Jack.                                    
  TANNER [diving at the waste-paper basket and fishing the book out         
      for her] Then read it at once and decide.                             
  RAMSDEN [vehemently] If I am to be your guardian, I positively            
      forbid you to read that book, Annie. [He smites the table with        
      his fist and rises].                                                  
  ANN. Of course not if you dont wish it. [She puts the book on the         
      table].                                                               
  TANNER. If one guardian is to forbid you to read the other                
      guardian's book, how are we to settle it? Suppose I order you to      
      read it! What about your duty to me?                                  
  ANN [gently] I am sure you would never purposely force me into a          
      painful dilemma, Jack.                                                
  RAMSDEN [irritably] Yes, yes, Annie: this is all very well, and, as       
      I said, quite natural and becoming. But you must make a choice        
      one way or the other. We are as much in a dilemma as you.             
  ANN. I feel that I am too young, too inexperienced, to decide. My         
      father's wishes are sacred to me.                                     
  MRS WHITEFIELD. If you two men wont carry them out I must say it is       
      rather hard that you should put the responsibility on Ann. It         
      seems to me that people are always putting things on other            
      people in this world.                                                 
  RAMSDEN. I am sorry you take it in that way.                              
  ANN [touchingly] Do you refuse to accept me as your ward, Granny?         
  RAMSDEN. No: I never said that. I greatly object to act with Mr           
      Tanner: thats all.                                                    
  MRS WHITEFIELD. Why? Whats the matter with poor Jack?                     
  TANNER. My views are too advanced for him.                                
  RAMSDEN [indignantly] They are not. I deny it.                            
  ANN. Of course not. What nonsense! Nobody is more advanced than           
      Granny. I am sure it is Jack himself who has made all the             
      difficulty. Come Jack! be kind to me in my sorrow. You dont           
      refuse to accept me as your ward, do you?                             
  TANNER [gloomily] No. I let myself in for it; so I suppose I must         
      face it. [He turns away to the bookcase, and stands there,            
      moodily studying the titles of the volumes].                          
  ANN [rising and expanding with subdued but gushing delight] Then we       
      are all agreed; and my dear father's will is to be carried out.       
      You dont know what a joy that is to me and to my mother! [She         
      goes to Ramsden and presses both his hands, saying] And I shall       
      have my dear Granny to help and advise me. [She casts a glance        
      at Tanner over her shoulder]. And Jack the Giant Killer. [She         
      goes past her mother to Octavius]. And Jack's inseparable friend      
      Ricky-ticky-tavy [he blushes and looks inexpressibly foolish].        
  MRS WHITEFIELD [rising and shaking her widow's weeds straight] Now        
      that you are Ann's guardian, Mr Ramsden, I wish you would speak       
      to her about her habit of giving people nicknames. They cant be       
      expected to like it. [She moves towards the door].                    
  ANN. How can you say such a thing, Mamma! [Glowing with affectionate      
      remorse] Oh, I wonder can you be right! Have I been                   
      inconsiderate! [She turns to Octavius, who is sitting astride         
      his chair with his elbows on the back of it. Putting her hand on      
      his forehead she turns his face up suddenly]. Do you want to be       
      treated like a grown-up man? Must I call you Mr Robinson in           
      future?                                                               
  OCTAVIUS [earnestly] Oh please call me Ricky-ticky-tavy. "Mr              
      Robinson" would hurt me cruelly. [She laughs and pats his cheek       
      with her finger; then comes back to Ramsden]. You know I'm            
      beginning to think that Granny is rather a piece of                   
      impertinence. But I never dreamt of its hurting you.                  
  RAMSDEN [breezily, as he pats her affectionately on the back] My          
      dear Annie, nonsense. I insist on Granny. I wont answer to any        
      other name than Annie's Granny.                                       
  ANN [gratefully] You all spoil me, except Jack.                           
  TANNER [over his shoulder, from the bookcase] I think you ought to        
      call me Mr Tanner.                                                    
  ANN [gently] No you dont, Jack. Thats like the things you say on          
      purpose to shock people: those who know you pay no attention to       
      them. But, if you like, I'll call you after your famous ancestor      
      Don Juan.                                                             
  RAMSDEN. Don Juan!                                                        
  ANN [innocently] Oh, is there any harm in it? I didnt know. Then I        
      certainly wont call you that. May I call you Jack until I can         
      think of something else?                                              
  TANNER. Oh, for Heaven's sake dont try to invent anything worse. I        
      capitulate. I consent to Jack. I embrace Jack. Here endeth my         
      first and last attempt to assert my authority.                        
  ANN. You see, Mamma, they all really like to have pet names.              
  MRS WHITEFIELD. Well, I think you might at least drop them until we       
      are out of mourning.                                                  
  ANN [reproachfully, stricken to the soul] Oh, how could you remind        
      me, mother? [She hastily leaves the room to conceal her               
      emotion].                                                             
  MRS WHITEFIELD. Of course. My fault as usual! [She follows Ann].          
  TANNER [coming from the bookcase] Ramsden: we're beaten- smashed-         
      nonentitized, like her mother.                                        
  RAMSDEN. Stuff, sir. [He follows Mrs Whitefield out of the room].         
  TANNER [left alone with Octavius, stares whimsically at him] Tavy:        
      do you want to count for something in the world?                      
  OCTAVIUS. I want to count for something as a poet: I want to write        
      a great play.                                                         
  TANNER. With Ann as the heroine?                                          
  OCTAVIUS. Yes: I confess it.                                              
  TANNER. Take care, Tavy. The play with Ann as the heroine is all          
      right; but if youre not very careful, by heaven she'll marry          
      you.                                                                  
  OCTAVIUS [sighing] No such luck, Jack!                                    
  TANNER. Why, man, your head is in the lioness's mouth: you are half       
      swallowed already- in three bites- Bite One, Ricky; Bite Two,         
      Ticky; Bite Three, Tavy; and down you go.                             
  OCTAVIUS. She is the same to everybody, Jack: you know her ways.          
  TANNER. Yes: she breaks everybody's back with the stroke of her paw;      
      but the question is, which of us will she eat? My own opinion is      
      that she means to eat you.                                            
  OCTAVIUS [rising, pettishly] It's horrible to talk like that about        
      her when she is upstairs crying for her father. But I do so want      
      her to eat me that I can bear your brutalities because they give      
      me hope.                                                              
  TANNER. Tavy: thats the devilish side of a woman's fascination: she       
      makes you will your own destruction.                                  
  OCTAVIUS. But it's not destruction: it's fulfilment.                      
  TANNER. Yes, of her purpose; and that purpose is neither her              
      happiness nor yours, but Nature's. Vitality in a woman is a           
      blind fury of creation. She sacrifices herself to it: do you          
      think she will hesitate to sacrifice you?                             
  OCTAVIUS. Why, it is just because she is self-sacrificing that she        
      will not sacrifice those she loves.                                   
  TANNER. That is the profoundest of mistakes, Tavy. It is the              
      self-sacrificing women that sacrifice others most recklessly.         
      Because they are unselfish, they are kind in little things.           
      Because they have a purpose which is not their own purpose, but       
      that of the whole universe, a man is nothing to them but an           
      instrument of that purpose.                                           
  OCTAVIUS. Dont be ungenerous, Jack. They take the tenderest care of       
      us.                                                                   
  TANNER. Yes, as a soldier takes care of his rifle or a musician of        
      his violin. But do they allow us any purpose or freedom of our        
      own? Will they lend us to one another? Can the strongest man          
      escape from them when once he is appropriated? They tremble when      
      we are in danger, and weep when we die; but the tears are not         
      for us, but for a father wasted, a son's breeding thrown away.        
      They accuse us of treating them as a mere means to our pleasure;      
      but how can so feeble and transient a folly as a man's selfish        
      pleasure enslave a woman as the whole purpose of Nature embodied      
      in a woman can enslave a man?                                         
  OCTAVIUS. What matter, if the slavery makes us happy?                     
  TANNER. No matter at all if you have no purpose of your own, and          
      are, like most men, a mere breadwinner. But you, Tavy, are an         
      artist: that is, you have a purpose as absorbing and as               
      unscrupulous as a woman's purpose.                                    
  OCTAVIUS. Not unscrupulous.                                               
  TANNER. Quite unscrupulous. The true artist will let his wife             
      starve, his children go barefoot, his mother drudge for his           
      living at seventy, sooner than work at anything but his art. To       
      women he is half vivisector, half vampire. He gets into intimate      
      relations with them to study them, to strip the mask of               
      convention from them, to surprise their inmost secrets, knowing       
      that they have the power to rouse his deepest creative energies,      
      to rescue him from his cold reason, to make him see visions and       
      dream dreams, to inspire him, as he calls it. He persuades women      
      that they may do this for their own purpose whilst he really          
      means them to do it for his. He steals the mother's milk and          
      blackens it to make printer's ink to scoff at her and glorify         
      ideal women with. He pretends to spare her the pangs of               
      child-bearing so that he may have for himself the tenderness and      
      fostering that belong of right to her children. Since marriage        
      began, the great artist has been known as a bad husband. But he       
      is worse: he is a child-robber, a blood-sucker, a hypocrite, and      
      a cheat. Perish the race and wither a thousand women if only the      
      sacrifice of them enable him to act Hamlet better, to paint a         
      finer picture, to write a deeper poem, a greater play, a              
      profounder philosophy! For mark you, Tavy, the artist's work is       
      to shew us ourselves as we really are. Our minds are nothing but      
      this knowledge of ourselves; and he who adds a jot to such            
      knowledge creates new mind as surely as any woman creates new         
      men. In the rage of that creation he is as ruthless as the            
      woman, as dangerous to her as she to him, and as horribly             
      fascinating. Of all human struggles there is none so treacherous      
      and remorseless as the struggle between the artist man and the        
      mother woman. Which shall use up the other? that is the issue         
      between them. And it is all the deadlier because, in your             
      romanticist cant, they love one another.                              
  OCTAVIUS. Even if it were so- and I dont admit it for a moment- it        
      is out of the deadliest struggles that we get the noblest             
      characters.                                                           
  TANNER. Remember that the next time you meet a grizzly bear or a          
      Bengal tiger, Tavy.                                                   
  OCTAVIUS. I meant where there is love, Jack.                              
  TANNER. Oh, the tiger will love you. There is no love sincerer than       
      the love of food. I think Ann loves you that way: she patted          
      your cheek as if it were a nicely underdone chop.                     
  OCTAVIUS. You know, Jack, I should have to run away from you if I         
      did not make it a fixed rule not to mind anything you say. You        
      come out with perfectly revolting things sometimes.                   

    Ramsden returns, followed by Ann. They come in quickly, with their      
former leisurely air of decorous grief changed to one of genuine            
concern, and, on Ramsden's part, of worry. He comes between the two         
men, intending to address Octavius, but pulls himself up abruptly as        
he sees Tanner.                                                             

  RAMSDEN. I hardly expected to find you still here, Mr Tanner.             
  TANNER. Am I in the way? Good morning, fellow guardian [he goes           
      towards the door].                                                    
  ANN. Stop, Jack. Granny: he must know, sooner or later.                   
  RAMSDEN. Octavius: I have a very serious piece of news for you. It        
      is of the most private and delicate nature- of the most painful       
      nature too, I am sorry to say. Do you wish Mr Tanner to be            
      present whilst I explain?                                             
  OCTAVIUS [turning pale] I have no secrets from Jack.                      
  RAMSDEN. Before you decide that finally, let me say that the news         
      concerns your sister, and that it is terrible news.                   
  OCTAVIUS. Violet! What has happened? Is she- dead?                        
  RAMSDEN. I am not sure that it is not even worse than that.               
  OCTAVIUS. Is she badly hurt? Has there been an accident?                  
  RAMSDEN. No: nothing of that sort.                                        
  TANNER. Ann: will you have the common humanity to tell us what the        
      matter is?                                                            
  ANN [half whispering] I cant. Violet has done something dreadful. We      
      shall have to get her away somewhere. [She flutters to the            
      writing table and sits in Ramsden's chair, leaving the three men      
      to fight it out between them].                                        
  OCTAVIUS [enlightened] Is that what you meant, Mr Ramsden?                
  RAMSDEN. Yes. [Octavius sinks upon a chair, crushed]. I am afraid         
      there is no doubt that Violet did not really go to Eastbourne         
      three weeks ago when we thought she was with the Parry                
      Whitefields. And she called on a strange doctor yesterday with        
      a wedding ring on her finger. Mrs Parry Whitefield met her there      
      by chance; and so the whole thing came out.                           
  OCTAVIUS [rising with his fists clenched] Who is the scoundrel?           
  ANN. She wont tell us.                                                    
  OCTAVIUS [collapsing into the chair again] What a frightful thing!        
  TANNER [with angry sarcasm] Dreadful, Appalling. Worse than death,        
      as Ramsden says. [He comes to Octavius]. What would you not           
      give, Tavy, to turn it into a railway accident, with all her          
      bones broken, or something equally respectable and deserving of       
      sympathy?                                                             
  OCTAVIUS. Dont be brutal, Jack.                                           
  TANNER. Brutal! Good Heavens, man, what are you crying for? Here is       
      a woman we all supposed to be making bad water color sketches,        
      practising Grieg and Brahms, gadding about to concerts and            
      parties, wasting her life and her money. We suddenly learn that       
      she has turned from these sillinesses to the fulfilment of her        
      highest purpose and greatest function- to increase, multiply,         
      and replenish the earth. And instead of admiring her courage and      
      rejoicing in her instinct; instead of crowning the completed          
      womanhood and raising the triumphal strain of "Unto us a child        
      is born: unto us a son is given", here you are- you who have          
      been as merry as grigs in your mourning for the dead- all             
      pulling long faces and looking as ashamed and disgraced as if         
      the girl had committed the vilest of crimes.                          
  RAMSDEN [roaring with rage] I will not have these abominations            
      uttered in my house [he smites the writing table with his fist].      
  TANNER. Look here: if you insult me again I'll take you at your word      
      and leave your house. Ann: where is Violet now?                       
  ANN. Why? Are you going to her?                                           
  TANNER. Of course I am going to her. She wants help; she wants            
      money; she wants respect and congratulation; she wants every          
      chance for her child. She does not seem likely to get it from         
      you: she shall from me. Where is she?                                 
  ANN. Dont be so headstrong, Jack. She's upstairs.                         
  TANNER. What! Under Ramsden's sacred roof! Go and do your miserable       
      duty, Ramsden. Hunt her out into the street. Cleanse your             
      threshold from her contamination. Vindicate the purity of your        
      English home. I'll go for a cab.                                      
  ANN [alarmed] Oh, Granny, you mustnt do that.                             
  OCTAVIUS [broken-heartedly, rising] I'll take her away, Mr Ramsden.       
      She had no right to come to your house.                               
  RAMSDEN [indignantly] But I am only too anxious to help her.              
      [Turning on Tanner] How dare you, sir, impute such monstrous          
      intentions to me? I protest against it. I am ready to put down        
      my last penny to save her from being driven to run to you for         
      protection.                                                           
  TANNER [subsiding] It's all right, then. He's not going to act up to      
      his principles. It's agreed that we all stand by Violet.              
  OCTAVIUS. But who is the man? He can make reparation by marrying          
      her; and he shall, or he shall answer for it to me.                   
  RAMSDEN. He shall, Octavius. There you speak like a man.                  
  TANNER. Then you dont think him a scoundrel, after all?                   
  OCTAVIUS. Not a scoundrel! He is a heartless scoundrel.                   
  RAMSDEN. A damned scoundrel. I beg your pardon, Annie; but I can say      
      no less.                                                              
  TANNER. So we are to marry your sister to a damned scoundrel by way       
      of reforming her character! On my soul, I think you are all mad.      
  ANN. Dont be absurd, Jack. Of course you are quite right, Tavy; but       
      we dont know who he is: Violet wont tell us.                          
  TANNER. What on earth does it matter who he is? He's done his part;       
      and Violet must do the rest.                                          
  RAMSDEN [beside himself] Stuff! lunacy! There is a rascal in our          
      midst, a libertine, a villain worse than a murderer; and we are       
      not to learn who he is! In our ignorance we are to shake him by       
      the hand; to introduce him into our homes; to trust our               
      daughters with him; to- to-                                           
  ANN [coaxingly] There, Granny, dont talk so loud. It's most               
      shocking: we must all admit that; but if Violet wont tell us,         
      what can we do? Nothing. Simply nothing.                              
  RAMSDEN. Hmph! I'm not so sure of that. If any man has paid Violet        
      any special attention, we can easily find that out. If there is       
      any man of notoriously loose principles among us-                     
  TANNER. Ahem!                                                             
  RAMSDEN [raising his voice] Yes, sir, I repeat, if there is any man       
      of notoriously loose principles among us-                             
  TANNER. Or any man notoriously lacking in self-control.                   
  RAMSDEN [aghast] Do you dare to suggest that *I* am capable of such       
      an act?                                                               
  TANNER. My dear Ramsden, this is an act of which every man is             
      capable. That is what comes of getting at cross purposes with         
      Nature. The suspicion you have just flung at me clings to us          
      all. It's a sort of mud that sticks to the judge's ermine or the      
      cardinal's robe as fast as to the rags of the tramp. Come, Tavy!      
      dont look so bewildered: it might have been me: it might have         
      been Ramsden; just as it might have been anybody. If it had,          
      what could we do but lie and protest- as Ramsden is going to          
      protest.                                                              
  RAMSDEN [choking] I- I- I-                                                
  TANNER. Guilt itself could not stammer more confusedly. And yet you       
      know perfectly well he's innocent, Tavy.                              
  RAMSDEN [exhausted] I am glad you admit that, sir. I admit, myself,       
      that there is an element of truth in what you say, grossly as         
      you may distort it to gratify your malicious humor. I hope,           
      Octavius, no suspicion of me is possible in your mind.                
  OCTAVIUS. Of you! No, not for a moment.                                   
  TANNER [drily] I think he suspects me just a little.                      
  OCTAVIUS. Jack: you couldnt- you wouldnt-                                 
  TANNER. Why not?                                                          
  OCTAVIUS [appalled] Why not!                                              
  TANNER. Oh, well, I'll tell you why not. First, you would feel bound      
      to quarrel with me. Second, Violet doesnt like me. Third, if I        
      had the honor of being the father of Violet's child, I should         
      boast of it instead of denying it. So be easy: our friendship         
      is not in danger.                                                     
  OCTAVIUS. I should have put away the suspicion with horror if only        
      you would think and feel naturally about it. I beg your pardon.       
  TANNER. My pardon! nonsense! And now lets sit down and have a family      
      council. [He sits down. The rest follow his example, more or          
      less under protest]. Violet is going to do the State a service;       
      consequently she must be packed abroad like a criminal until          
      it's over. Whats happening upstairs?                                  
  ANN. Violet is in the housekeeper's room- by herself, of course.          
  TANNER. Why not in the drawing room?                                      
  ANN. Dont be absurd, Jack. Miss Ramsden is in the drawing room with       
      my mother, considering what to do.                                    
  TANNER. Oh! the housekeeper's room is the penitentiary, I suppose;        
      and the prisoner is waiting to be brought before her judges. The      
      old cats!                                                             
  ANN. Oh, Jack!                                                            
  RAMSDEN. You are at present a guest beneath the roof of one of the        
      old cats, sir. My sister is the mistress of this house.               
  TANNER. She would put me in the housekeeper's room, too, if she           
      dared, Ramsden. However, I withdraw cats. Cats would have more        
      sense. Ann: as your guardian, I order you to go to Violet at          
      once and be particularly kind to her.                                 
  ANN. I have seen her, Jack. And I am sorry to say I am afraid she is      
      going to be rather obstinate about going abroad. I think Tavy         
      ought to speak to her about it.                                       
  OCTAVIUS. How can I speak to her about such a thing [he breaks            
      down]?                                                                
  ANN. Dont break down, Ricky. Try to bear it for all our sakes.            
  RAMSDEN. Life is not all plays and poems, Octavius. Come! face it         
      like a man.                                                           
  TANNER [chafing again] Poor dear brother! Poor dear friends of the        
      family! Poor dear Tabbies and Grimalkins! Poor dear everybody         
      except the woman who is going to risk her life to create another      
      life! Tavy: dont you be a selfish ass. Away with you and talk to      
      Violet; and bring her down here if she cares to come. [Octavius       
      rises]. Tell her we'll stand by her.                                  
  RAMSDEN [rising] No, sir-                                                 
  TANNER [rising also and interrupting him] Oh, we understand: it's         
      against your conscience; but still youll do it.                       
  OCTAVIUS. I assure you all, on my word, I never meant to be selfish.      
      It's so hard to know what to do when one wishes earnestly to do       
      right.                                                                
  TANNER. My dear Tavy, your pious English habit of regarding the           
      world as a moral gymnasium built expressly to strengthen your         
      character in, occasionally leads you to think about your own          
      confounded principles when you should be thinking about other         
      people's necessities. The need of the present hour is a happy         
      mother and a healthy baby. Bend your energies on that; and you        
      will see your way clearly enough.                                     

    Octavius, much perplexed, goes out.                                     

  RAMSDEN [facing Tanner impressively] And Morality, sir? What is to        
      become of that?                                                       
  TANNER. Meaning a weeping Magdalen and an innocent child branded          
      with her shame. Not in our circle, thank you. Morality can go         
      to its father the devil.                                              
  RAMSDEN. I thought so, sir. Morality sent to the devil to please          
      our libertines, male and female. That is to be the future of          
      England, is it?                                                       
  TANNER. Oh, England will survive your disapproval. Meanwhile, I           
      understand that you agree with me as to the practical course we       
      are to take?                                                          
  RAMSDEN. Not in your spirit, sir. Not for your reasons.                   
  TANNER. You can explain that if anybody calls you to account, here        
      or hereafter. [He turns away, and plants himself in front of Mr       
      Herbert Spencer, at whom he stares gloomily].                         
  ANN [rising and coming to Ramsden] Granny: hadnt you better go up to      
      the drawing room and tell them what we intend to do?                  
  RAMSDEN [looking pointedly at Tanner] I hardly like to leave you          
      alone with this gentleman. Will you not come with me?                 
  ANN. Miss Ramsden would not like to speak about it before me,             
      Granny. I ought not to be present.                                    
  RAMSDEN. You are right: I should have thought of that. You are a          
      good girl, Annie.                                                     

    He pats her on the shoulder. She looks up at him with beaming           
eyes; and he goes out, much moved. Having disposed of him, she looks        
at Tanner. His back being turned to her, she gives a moment's               
attention to her personal appearance, then softly goes to him and           
speaks almost into his ear.                                                 

  ANN. Jack [he turns with a start]: are you glad that you are my           
      guardian? You dont mind being made responsible for me, I hope.        
  TANNER. The latest addition to your collection of scapegoats, eh?         
  ANN. Oh, that stupid old joke of yours about me! Do please drop it.       
      Why do you say things that you know must pain me? I do my best        
      to please you, Jack: I suppose I may tell you so now that you         
      are my guardian. You will make me so unhappy if you refuse to         
      be friends with me.                                                   
  TANNER [studying her as gloomily as he studied the bust] You need         
      not go begging for my regard. How unreal our moral judgments          
      are! You seem to me to have absolutely no conscience- only            
      hypocrisy; and you cant see the difference- yet there is a sort       
      of fascination about you. I always attend to you, somehow. I          
      should miss you if I lost you.                                        
  ANN [tranquilly slipping her arm into his and walking about with          
      him] But isnt that only natural, Jack? We have known each other       
      since we were children. Do you remember-                              
  TANNER [abruptly breaking loose] Stop! I remember everything.             
  ANN. Oh, I daresay we were often very silly; but-                         
  TANNER. I wont have it, Ann. I am no more that schoolboy now than I       
      am the dotard of ninety I shall grow into if I live long enough.      
      It is over: let me forget it.                                         
  ANN. Wasnt it a happy time? [She attempts to take his arm again].         
  TANNER. Sit down and behave yourself. [He makes her sit down in the       
      chair next the writing table]. No doubt it was a happy time for       
      you. You were a good girl and never compromised yourself. And         
      yet the wickedest child that ever was slapped could hardly have       
      had a better time. I can understand the success with which you        
      bullied the other girls: your virtue imposed on them. But tell        
      me this: did you ever know a good boy?                                
  ANN. Of course. All boys are foolish sometimes; but Tavy was always       
      a really good boy.                                                    
  TANNER [struck by this] Yes: youre right. For some reason you never       
      tempted Tavy.                                                         
  ANN. Tempted! Jack!                                                       
  TANNER. Yes, my dear Lady Mephistopheles, tempted. You were               
      insatiably curious as to what a boy might be capable of, and          
      diabolically clever at getting through his guard and surprising       
      his inmost secrets.                                                   
  ANN. What nonsense! All because you used to tell me long stories of       
      the wicked things you had done- silly boy's tricks! And you call      
      such things inmost secrets! Boys' secrets are just like men's;        
      and you know what they are!                                           
  TANNER [obstinately] No I dont. What are they, pray?                      
  ANN. Why, the things they tell everybody, of course.                      
  TANNER. Now I swear I told you things I told no one else. You lured       
      me into a compact by which we were to have no secrets from one        
      another. We were to tell one another everything. I didnt notice       
      that you never told me anything.                                      
  ANN. You didnt want to talk about me, Jack. You wanted to talk about      
      yourself.                                                             
  TANNER. Ah, true, horribly true, But what a devil of a child you          
      must have been to know that weakness and to play on it for the        
      satisfaction of your own curiosity! I wanted to brag to you, to       
      make myself interesting. And I found myself doing all sorts of        
      mischievous things simply to have something to tell you about.        
      I fought with boys I didnt hate; I lied about things I might          
      just as well have told the truth about; I stole things I didnt        
      want; I kissed little girls I didnt care for. It was all              
      bravado: passionless and therefore unreal.                            
  ANN. I never told of you, Jack.                                           
  TANNER. No; but if you had wanted to stop me you would have told of       
      me. You wanted me to go on.                                           
  ANN [flashing out] Oh, thats not true: it's not true, Jack. I never       
      wanted you to do those dull, disappointing, brutal, stupid,           
      vulgar things. I always hoped that it would be something really       
      heroic at last. [Recovering herself] Excuse me, Jack; but the         
      things you did were never a bit like the things I wanted you to       
      do. They often gave me great uneasiness; but I could not tell         
      of you and get you into trouble. And you were only a boy. I knew      
      you would grow out of them. Perhaps I was wrong.                      
  TANNER [sardonically] Do not give way to remorse, Ann. At least           
      nineteen twentieths of the exploits I confessed to you were pure      
      lies. I soon noticed that you didnt like the true stories.            
  ANN. Of course I knew that some of the things couldnt have happened.      
      But-                                                                  
  TANNER. You are going to remind me that some of the most disgraceful      
      ones did.                                                             
  ANN [fondly, to his great terror] I dont want to remind you of            
      anything. But I knew the people they happened to, and heard           
      about them.                                                           
  TANNER. Yes; but even the true stories were touched up for telling.       
      A sensitive boy's humiliations may be very good fun for ordinary      
      thickskinned grown-ups; but to the boy himself they are so            
      acute, so ignominious, that he cannot confess them- cannot but        
      deny them passionately. However, perhaps it was as well for me        
      that I romanced a bit; for, on the one occasion when I told you       
      the truth, you threatened to tell of me.                              
  ANN. Oh, never. Never once.                                               
  TANNER. Yes, you did. Do you remember a dark-eyed girl named Rachel       
      Rosetree? [Ann's brows contract for an instant involuntarily].        
      I got up a love affair with her; and we met one night in the          
      garden and walked about very uncomfortably with our arms round        
      one another, and kissed at parting, and were most                     
      conscientiously romantic. If that love affair had gone on, it         
      would have bored me to death; but it didnt go on; for the next        
      thing that happened was that Rachel cut me because she found          
      out that I had told you. How did she find it out? From you. You       
      went to her and held the guilty secret over her head, leading         
      her a life of abject terror and humiliation by threatening to         
      tell on her.                                                          
  ANN. And a very good thing for her, too. It was my duty to stop her       
      misconduct; and she is thankful to me for it now.                     
  TANNER. Is she?                                                           
  ANN. She ought to be, at all events.                                      
  TANNER. It was not your duty to stop my misconduct, I suppose.            
  ANN. I did stop it by stopping her.                                       
  TANNER. Are you sure of that? You stopped my telling you about my         
      adventures; but how do you know that you stopped the adventures?      
  ANN. Do you mean to say that you went on in the same way with other       
      girls?                                                                
  TANNER. No. I had enough of that sort of romantic tomfoolery with         
      Rachel.                                                               
  ANN [unconvinced] Then why did you break off our confidences and          
      become quite strange to me?                                           
  TANNER [enigmatically] It happened just then that I got something         
      that I wanted to keep all to myself instead of sharing it with        
      you.                                                                  
  ANN. I am sure I shouldnt have asked for any of it if you had             
      grudged it.                                                           
  TANNER. It wasnt a box of sweets, Ann. It was something youd never        
      have let me call my own.                                              
  ANN [incredulously] What?                                                 
  TANNER. My soul.                                                          
  ANN. Oh, do be sensible, Jack. You know youre talking nonsense.           
  TANNER. The most solemn earnest, Ann. You didnt notice at that time       
      that you were getting a soul too. But you were. It was not for        
      nothing that you suddenly found you had a moral duty to chastise      
      and reform Rachel. Up to that time you had traded pretty              
      extensively in being a good child; but you had never set up a         
      sense of duty to others. Well, I set one up too. Up to that time      
      I had played the boy buccaneer with no more conscience than a         
      fox in a poultry farm. But now I began to have scruples, to feel      
      obligations, to find that veracity and honor were no longer           
      goody-goody expressions in the mouths of grown-up people, but         
      compelling principle in myself.                                       
  ANN [quietly] Yes, I suppose youre right. You were beginning to be a      
      man, and I to be a woman.                                             
  TANNER. Are you sure it was not that we were beginning to be              
      something more? What does the beginning of manhood and womanhood      
      mean in most people's mouths? You know: it means the beginning        
      of love. But love began long before that for me. Love played its      
      part in the earliest dreams and follies and romances I can            
      remember- may I say the earliest follies and romances we can          
      remember?- though we did not understand it at the time. No: the       
      change that came to me was the birth in me of moral passion; and      
      I declare that according to my experience moral passion is the        
      only real passion.                                                    
  ANN. All passions ought to be moral, Jack.                                
  TANNER. Ought! Do you think that anything is strong enough to impose      
      oughts on a passion except a stronger passion still?                  
  ANN. Our moral sense controls passion, Jack. Dont be stupid.              
  TANNER. Our moral sense! And is that not a passion? Is the devil to       
      have all the passions as well as all the good tunes? If it were       
      not a passion- if it were not the mightiest of the passions, all      
      the other passions would sweep it away like a leaf before a           
      hurricane. It is the birth of that passion that turns a child         
      into a man.                                                           
  ANN. There are other passions, Jack. Very strong ones.                    
  TANNER. All the other passions were in me before; but they were idle      
      and aimless- mere childish greedinesses and cruelties,                
      curiosities and fancies, habits and superstitions, grotesque and      
      ridiculous to the mature intelligence. When they suddenly began       
      to shine like newly lit flames it was by no light of their own,       
      but by the radiance of the dawning moral passion. That passion        
      dignified them, gave them conscience and meaning, found them a        
      mob of appetites and organized them into an army of purposes and      
      principles. My soul was born of that passion.                         
  ANN. I noticed that you got more sense. You were a dreadfully             
      destructive boy before that.                                          
  TANNER. Destructive! Stuff! I was only mischievous.                       
  ANN. Oh, Jack, you were very destructive. You ruined all the young        
      fir trees by chopping off their leaders with a wooden sword. You      
      broke all the cucumber frames with your catapult. You set fire        
      to the common: the police arrested Tavy for it because he ran         
      away when he couldnt stop you. You-                                   
  TANNER. Pooh! pooh! pooh! these were battles, bombardments,               
      stratagems to save our scalps from the red Indians. You have no       
      imagination, Ann. I am ten times more destructive now than I was      
      then. The moral passion has taken my destructiveness in hand and      
      directed it to moral ends. I have become a reformer, and, like        
      all reformers, an iconoclast. I no longer break cucumber frames       
      and burn gorse bushes: I shatter creeds and demolish idols.           
  ANN [bored] I am afraid I am too feminine to see any sense in             
      destruction. Destruction can only destroy.                            
  TANNER. Yes. That is why it is so useful. Construction cumbers the        
      ground with institutions made by busybodies. Destruction clears       
      it and gives us breathing space and liberty.                          
  ANN. It's no use, Jack. No woman will agree with you there.               
  TANNER. Thats because you confuse construction and destruction with       
      creation and murder. Theyre quite different: I adore creation         
      and abhor murder. Yes: I adore it in tree and flower, in bird         
      and beast, even in you. [A flush of interest and delight              
      suddenly chases the growing perplexity and boredom from her           
      face]. It was the creative instinct that led you to attach me         
      to you by bonds that have left their mark on me to this day.          
      Yes, Ann: the old childish compact between us was an unconscious      
      love compact-                                                         
  ANN. Jack!                                                                
  TANNER. Oh, dont be alarmed-                                              
  ANN. I am not alarmed.                                                    
  TANNER [whimisically] Then you ought to be: where are your                
      principles?                                                           
  ANN. Jack: are you serious or are you not?                                
  TANNER. Do you mean about the moral passion?                              
  ANN. No, no: the other one. [Confused] Oh! you are so silly: one          
      never knows how to take you.                                          
  TANNER. You must take me quite seriously. I am your guardian; and it      
      is my duty to improve your mind.                                      
  ANN. The love compact is over, then, is it? I suppose you grew tired      
      of me?                                                                
  TANNER. No; but the moral passion made our childish relations             
      impossible. A jealous sense of my new individuality arose in me-      
  ANN. You hated to be treated as a boy any longer. Poor Jack!              
  TANNER. Yes, because to be treated as a boy was to be taken on the        
      old footing. I had become a new person; and those who knew the        
      old person laughed at me. The only man who behaved sensibly was       
      my tailor: he took my measure anew every time he saw me, whilst       
      all the rest went on with their old measurements and expected         
      them to fit me.                                                       
  ANN. You became frightfully self-conscious.                               
  TANNER. When you go to heaven, Ann, you will be frightfully               
      conscious of your wings for the first year or so. When you meet       
      your relatives there, and they persist in treating you as if you      
      were still a mortal, you will not be able to bear them. You will      
      try to get into a circle which has never known you except as an       
      angel.                                                                
  ANN. So it was only your vanity that made you run away from us after      
      all?                                                                  
  TANNER. Yes, only my vanity, as you call it.                              
  ANN. You need not have kept away from me on that account.                 
  TANNER. From you above all others. You fought harder than anybody         
      against my emancipation.                                              
  ANN [earnestly] Oh, how wrong you are! I would have done anything         
      for you.                                                              
  TANNER. Anything except let me get loose from you. Even then you had      
      acquired by instinct that damnable woman's trick of heaping           
      obligations on a man, of placing yourself so entirely and             
      helplessly at his mercy that at last he dare not take a step          
      without running to you for leave. I know a poor wretch whose one      
      desire in life is to run away from his wife. She prevents him by      
      threatening to throw herself in front of the engine of the train      
      he leaves her in. That is what all women do. If we try to go          
      where you do not want us to go there is no law to prevent us;         
      but when we take the first step your breasts are under our foot       
      as it descends: your bodies are under our wheels as we start. No      
      woman shall ever enslave me in that way.                              
  ANN. But, Jack, you cannot get through life without considering           
      other people a little.                                                
  TANNER. Ay; but what other people? It is this consideration of other      
      people- or rather this cowardly fear of them which we call            
      consideration- that makes us the sentimental slaves we are. To        
      consider you, as you call it, is to substitute your will for my       
      own. How if it be a baser will than mine? Are women taught            
      better than men or worse? Are mobs of voters taught better than       
      statesmen or worse? Worse, of course, in both cases. And then         
      what sort of world are you going to get, with its public men          
      considering its voting mobs, and its private men considering          
      their wives? What does Church and State mean nowadays? The Woman      
      and the Ratepayer.                                                    
  ANN [placidly] I am so glad you understand politics, Jack: it will        
      be most useful to you if you go into parliament [he collapses         
      like a pricked bladder]. But I am sorry you thought my influence      
      a bad one.                                                            
  TANNER. I dont say it was a bad one. But bad or good, I didnt choose      
      to be cut to your measure. And I wont be cut to it.                   
  ANN. Nobody wants you to, Jack. I assure you- really on my word- I        
      dont mind your queer opinions one little bit. You know we have        
      all been brought up to have advanced opinions. Why do you             
      persist in thinking me so narrow minded?                              
  TANNER. Thats the danger of it. I know you dont mind, because youve       
      found out that it doesnt matter. The boa constrictor doesnt mind      
      the opinions of a stag one little bit when once she has got her       
      coils round it.                                                       
  ANN [rising in sudden enlightenment] O-o-o-o-oh! now I understand         
      why you warned Tavy that I am a boa constrictor. Granny told me.      
      [She laughs and throws her boa round his neck]. Doesnt it feel        
      nice and soft, Jack?                                                  
  TANNER [in the toils] You scandalous woman, will you throw away even      
      your hypocrisy?                                                       
  ANN. I am never hypocritical with you, Jack. Are you angry? [She          
      withdraws the boa and throws it on a chair]. Perhaps I shouldnt       
      have done that.                                                       
  TANNER [contemptuously] Pooh, prudery! Why should you not, if it          
      amuses you?                                                           
  ANN [shyly] Well, because- because I suppose what you really meant        
      by the boa constrictor was this [she puts her arms round his          
      neck].                                                                
  TANNER [staring at her] Magnificent audacity! [She laughs and pats        
      his cheeks]. Now just to think that if I mentioned this episode       
      not a soul would believe me except the people who would cut me        
      for telling, whilst if you accused me of it nobody would believe      
      my denial!                                                            
  ANN [taking her arms away with perfect dignity] You are                   
      incorrigible, Jack. But you should not jest about our affection       
      for one another. Nobody could possibly misunderstand it. You do       
      not misunderstand it, I hope.                                         
  TANNER. My blood interprets for me, Ann. Poor Ricky Ticky Tavy!           
  ANN [looking quickly at him as if this were a new light] Surely you       
      are not so absurd as to be jealous of Tavy.                           
  TANNER. Jealous! Why should I be? But I dont wonder at your grip of       
      him. I feel the coils tightening round my very self, though you       
      are only playing with me.                                             
  ANN. Do you think I have designs on Tavy?                                 
  TANNER. I know you have.                                                  
  ANN [earnestly] Take care, Jack. You may make Tavy very unhappy if        
      you mislead him about me.                                             
  TANNER. Never fear: he will not escape you.                               
  ANN. I wonder are you really a clever man!                                
  TANNER. Why this sudden misgiving on the subject?                         
  ANN. You seem to understand all the things I dont understand; but         
      you are a perfect baby in the things I do understand.                 
  TANNER. I understand how Tavy feels for you, Ann: you may depend on       
      that, at all events.                                                  
  ANN. And you think you understand how I feel for Tavy, dont you?          
  TANNER. I know only too well what is going to happen to poor Tavy.        
  ANN. I should laugh at you, Jack, if it were not for poor papa's          
      death. Mind! Tavy will be very unhappy.                               
  TANNER. Yes; but he wont know it, poor devil. He is a thousand times      
      too good for you. Thats why he is going to make the mistake of        
      his life about you.                                                   
  ANN. I think men make more mistakes by being too clever than by           
      being too good [she sits down, with a trace of contempt for the       
      whole male sex in the elegant carriage of her shoulders].             
  TANNER. Oh, I know you dont care very much about Tavy. But there is       
      always one who kisses and one who only allows the kiss. Tavy          
      will kiss; and you will only turn the cheek. And you will throw       
      him over if anybody better turns up.                                  
  ANN [offended] You have no right to say such things, Jack. They are       
      not true, and not delicate. If you and Tavy choose to be stupid       
      about me, that is not my fault.                                       
  TANNER [remorsefully] Forgive my brutalities, Ann. They are levelled      
      at this wicked world, not at you. [She looks up at him, pleased       
      and forgiving. He becomes cautious at once]. All the same, I          
      wish Ramsden would come back. I never feel safe with you: there       
      is a devilish charm- or no: not a charm, a subtle interest [she       
      laughs]- Just so: you know it; and you triumph in it. Openly and      
      shamelessly triumph in it!                                            
  ANN. What a shocking flirt you are, Jack!                                 
  TANNER. A flirt!! I!!!                                                    
  ANN. Yes, a flirt. You are always abusing and offending people; but       
      you never really mean to let go your hold of them.                    
  TANNER. I will ring the bell. This conversation has already gone          
      further than I intended.                                              

    Ramsden and Octavius come back with Miss Ramsden, a hardheaded old      
maiden lady in a plain brown silk gown, with enough rings, chains, and      
brooches to shew that her plainness of dress is a matter of principle,      
not of poverty. She comes into the room very determinedly: the two          
men, perplexed and downcast, following her. Ann rises and goes eagerly      
to meet her. Tanner retreats to the wall between the busts and              
pretends to study the pictures. Ramsden goes to his table as usual;         
and Octavius clings to the neighborhood of Tanner.                          

  MISS RAMSDEN [almost pushing Ann aside as she comes to Mrs                
      Whitefield's chair and plants herself there resolutely] I wash        
      my hands of the whole affair.                                         
  OCTAVIUS [very wretched] I know you wish me to take Violet away,          
      Miss Ramsden. I will. [He turns irresolutely to the door].            
  MISS RAMSDEN. What is the use of saying no, Roebuck? Octavius knows       
      that I would not turn any truly contrite and repentant woman          
      from your doors. But when a woman is not only wicked, but             
      intends to go on being wicked, she and I part company.                
  ANN. Oh, Miss Ramsden, what do you mean? What has Violet said?            
  RAMSDEN. Violet is certainly very obstinate. She wont leave London.       
      I dont understand her.                                                
  MISS RAMSDEN. I do. It's as plain as the nose on your face, Roebuck,      
      that she wont go because she doesnt want to be separated from         
      this man, whoever he is.                                              
  ANN. Oh, surely, surely! Octavius: did you speak to her?                  
  OCTAVIUS. She wont tell us anything. She wont make any arrangement        
      until she has consulted somebody. It cant be anybody else than        
      the scoundrel who has betrayed her.                                   
  TANNER [to Octavius] Well, let her consult him. He will be glad           
      enough to have her sent abroad. Where is the difficulty?              
  MISS RAMSDEN [taking the answer out of Octavius's mouth] The              
      difficulty, Mr Jack, is that when I offered to help her I didnt       
      offer to become her accomplice in her wickedness. She either          
      pledges her word never to see that man again, or else she finds       
      some new friends; and the sooner the better.                          

    The parlormaid appears at the door. Ann hastily resumes her             
seat, and looks as unconcerned as possible. Octavius instinctively          
imitates her.                                                               

  THE MAID. The cab is at the door, maam.                                   
  MISS RAMSDEN. What cab?                                                   
  THE MAID. For Miss Robinson.                                              
  MISS RAMSDEN. Oh! [Recovering herself] All right. [The maid               
      withdraws]. She has sent for a cab.                                   
  TANNER. *I* wanted to send for that cab half an hour ago.                 
  MISS RAMSDEN. I am glad she understands the position she has placed       
      herself in.                                                           
  RAMSDEN. I dont like her going away in this fashion, Susan. We had        
      better not do anything harsh.                                         
  OCTAVIUS. No: thank you again and again; but Miss Ramsden is quite        
      right. Violet cannot expect to stay.                                  
  ANN. Hadnt you better go with her, Tavy?                                  
  OCTAVIUS. She wont have me.                                               
  MISS RAMSDEN. Of course she wont. She's going straight to that man.       
  TANNER. As a natural result of her virtuous reception here.               
  RAMSDEN [much troubled] There, Susan! You hear! and theres some           
      truth in it. I wish you could reconcile it with your principles       
      to be a little patient with this poor girl. She's very young;         
      and theres a time for everything.                                     
  MISS RAMSDEN. Oh, she will get all the sympathy she wants from the        
      men. I'm surprised at you, Roebuck.                                   
  TANNER. So am I, Ramsden, most favorably.                                 

    Violet appears at the door. She is as impenitent and                    
self-possessed a young lady as one would desire to see among the            
best behaved of her sex. Her small head and tiny resolute mouth and         
chin; her haughty crispness of speech and trimness of carriage; the         
ruthless elegance of her equipment, which includes a very smart hat         
with a dead bird in it, mark a personality which is as formidable as        
it is exquisitely pretty. She is not a siren, like Ann: admiration          
comes to her without any compulsion or even interest on her part;           
besides, there is some fun in Ann, but in this woman none, perhaps          
no mercy either: if anything restrains her, it is intelligence and          
pride, not compassion. Her voice might be the voice of a                    
schoolmistress addressing a class of girls who had disgraced                
themselves, as she proceeds with complete composure and some disgust        
to say what she has come to say.                                            

  VIOLET. I have only looked in to tell Miss Ramsden that she will          
      find her birthday present to me, the filagree bracelet, in the        
      housekeeper's room.                                                   
  TANNER. Do come in, Violet; and talk to us sensibly.                      
  VIOLET. Thank you: I have had quite enough of the family                  
      conversation this morning. So has your mother, Ann: she has gone      
      home crying. But at all events, I have found out what some of my      
      pretended friends are worth. Goodbye.                                 
  TANNER. No, no: one moment. I have something to say which I beg you       
      to hear. [She looks at him without the slightest curiosity, but       
      waits, apparently as much to finish getting her glove on as to        
      hear what he has to say]. I am altogether on your side in this        
      matter. I congratulate you, with the sincerest respect, on            
      having the courage to do what you have done. You are entirely         
      in the right; and the family is entirely in the wrong.                

    Sensation. Ann and Miss Ramsden rise and turn towards the two.          
Violet, more surprised than any of the others, forgets her glove,           
and comes forward into the middle of the room, both puzzled and             
displeased. Octavius alone does not move nor raise his head: he is          
overwhelmed with shame.                                                     

  ANN [pleading to Tanner to be sensible] Jack!                             
  MISS RAMSDEN [outraged] Well, I must say!                                 
  VIOLET [sharply to Tanner] Who told you?                                  
  TANNER. Why, Ramsden and Tavy of course. Why should they not?             
  VIOLET. But they dont know.                                               
  TANNER. Dont know what?                                                   
  VIOLET. They dont know that I am in the right, I mean.                    
  TANNER. Oh, they know it in their hearts, though they think               
      themselves bound to blame you by their silly superstitions about      
      morality and propriety and so forth. But I know, and the whole        
      world really knows, though it dare not say so, that you were          
      right to follow your instinct; that vitality and bravery are the      
      greatest qualities a woman can have, and motherhood her solemn        
      initiation into womanhood; and that the fact of your not being        
      legally married matters not one scrap either to your own worth        
      or to our real regard for you.                                        
  VIOLET [flushing with indignation] Oh! You think me a wicked woman,       
      like the rest. You think I have not only been vile, but that I        
      share your abominable opinions. Miss Ramsden: I have borne your       
      hard words because I knew you would be sorry for them when you        
      found out the truth. But I wont bear such a horrible insult as        
      to be complimented by Jack on being one of the wretches of whom       
      he approves. I have kept my marriage a secret for my husband's        
      sake. But now I claim my right as a married woman not to be           
      insulted.                                                             
  OCTAVIUS [raising his head with inexpressible relief] You are             
      married!                                                              
  VIOLET. Yes; and I think you might have guessed it. What business         
      had you all to take it for granted that I had no right to wear        
      my wedding ring? Not one of you even asked me: I cannot forget        
      that.                                                                 
  TANNER [in ruins] I am utterly crushed. I meant well. I apologize-        
      abjectly apologize.                                                   
  VIOLET. I hope you will be more careful in future about the things        
      you say. Of course one does not take them seriously; but they         
      are very disagreeable, and rather in bad taste, I think.              
  TANNER [bowing to the storm] I have no defence: I shall know better       
      in future than to take any woman's part. We have all disgraced        
      ourselves in your eyes, I am afraid, except Ann. She befriended       
      you. For Ann's sake, forgive us.                                      
  VIOLET. Yes: Ann has been kind; but then Ann knew.                        
  TANNER [with a desperate gesture] Oh!!! Unfathomable deceit! Double       
      crossed!                                                              
  MISS RAMSDEN [stiffly] And who, pray, is the gentleman who does not       
      acknowledge his wife?                                                 
  VIOLET [promptly] That is my business, Miss Ramsden, and not yours.       
      I have my reasons for keeping my marriage a secret for the            
      present.                                                              
  RAMSDEN. All I can say is that we are extremely sorry, Violet. I am       
      shocked to think of how we have treated you.                          
  OCTAVIUS [awkwardly] I beg your pardon, Violet. I can say no more.        
  MISS RAMSDEN [still loth to surrender] Of course what you say puts a      
      very different complexion on the matter. All the same, I owe it       
      to myself-                                                            
  VIOLET [cutting her short] You owe me an apology, Miss Ramsden:           
      thats what you owe both to yourself and to me. If you were a          
      married woman you would not like sitting in the housekeeper's         
      room and being treated like a naughty child by young girls and        
      old ladies without any serious duties and responsibilities.           
  TANNER. Dont hit us when we're down, Violet. We seem to have made         
      fools of ourselves; but really it was you who made fools of us.       
  VIOLET. It was no business of yours, Jack, in any case.                   
  TANNER. No business of mine! Why, Ramsden as good as accused me of        
      being the unknown gentleman.                                          

    Ramsden makes a frantic demonstration; but Violet's cool keen           
anger extinguishes it.                                                      

  VIOLET. You! Oh, how infamous! how abominable! how disgracefully you      
      have all been talking about me! If my husband knew it he would        
      never let me speak to any of you again. [To Ramsden] I think you      
      might have spared me that, at least.                                  
  RAMSDEN. But I assure you I never- at least it is a monstrous             
      perversion of something I said that-                                  
  MISS RAMSDEN. You neednt apologize, Roebuck. She brought it all on        
      herself. It is for her to apologize for having deceived us.           
  VIOLET. I can make allowances for you, Miss Ramsden: you cannot           
      understand how I feel on this subject, though I should have           
      expected rather better taste from people of greater experience.       
      However, I quite feel that you have placed yourselves in a very       
      painful position; and the most truly considerate thing for me to      
      do is to go at once. Good morning.                                    

    She goes, leaving them staring.                                         

  MISS RAMSDEN. Well, I must say!                                           
  RAMSDEN [plaintively] I dont think she is quite fair to us.               
  TANNER. You must cower before the wedding ring like the rest of us,       
      Ramsden. The cup of our ignominy is full.                             


                               ACT TWO                                      

  ON the carriage drive in the park of a country house near Richmond        
an open touring car has broken down. It stands in front of a clump          
of trees round which the drive sweeps to the house, which is partly         
visible through them: indeed Tanner, standing in the drive with his         
back to us, could get an unobstructed view of the west corner of the        
house on his left were he not far too much interested in a pair of          
supine legs in dungaree overalls which protrude from beneath the            
machine. He is watching them intently with bent back and hands              
supported on his knees. His leathern overcoat and peaked cap                
proclaim him one of the dismounted passengers.                              

  THE LEGS. Aha! I got him.                                                 
  TANNER. All right now?                                                    
  THE LEGS. Aw rawt nah.                                                    

  Tanner stoops and takes the legs by the ankles, drawing their             
owner forth like a wheelbarrow, walking on his hands, with a hammer in      
his mouth. He is a young man in a neat suit of blue serge, clean            
shaven, dark eyed, square fingered, with short well brushed black hair      
and rather irregular sceptically turned eye-brows. When he is               
manipulating the car his movements are swift and sudden, yet attentive      
and deliberate. With Tanner and Tanner's friends his manner is not          
in the least deferential, but cool and reticent, keeping them quite         
effectually at a distance whilst giving them no excuse for complaining      
of him. Nevertheless he has a vigilant eye on them always, and that,        
too, rather cynically, like a man who knows the world well from its         
seamy side. He speaks slowly and with a touch of sarcasm; and as he         
does not at all affect the gentleman in his speech, it may be inferred      
that his smart appearance is a mark of respect to himself and his           
own class, not to that which employs him.                                   
  He now gets into the car to stow away his tools and divest himself        
of his overalls. Tanner takes off his leathern overcoat and pitches it      
into the car with a sigh of relief, glad to be rid of it. The               
Chauffeur, noting this, tosses his head contemptuously, and surveys         
his employer sardonically.                                                  

  THE CHAUFFEUR. Had enough of it, eh?                                      
  TANNER. I may as well walk to the house and stretch my legs and calm      
      my nerves a little. [Looking at his watch] I suppose you know         
      that we have come from Hyde Park Corner to Richmond in                
      twenty-one minutes.                                                   
  THE CHAUFFEUR. I'd ha done it under fifteen if I'd had a clear road       
      all the way.                                                          
  TANNER. Why do you do it? Is it for love of sport or for the fun of       
      terrifying your unfortunate employer?                                 
  THE CHAUFFEUR. What are you afraid of?                                    
  TANNER. The police, and breaking my neck.                                 
  THE CHAUFFEUR. Well, if you like easy going, you can take a bus, you      
      know. It's cheaper. You pay me to save your time and give you         
      the value of what you paid for the car. [He sits down calmly].        
  TANNER. I am the slave of that car and of you too. I dream of the         
      accursed thing at night.                                              
  THE CHAUFFEUR. Youll get over that all right. If youre going up to        
      the house, may I ask how long youre goin to stay? Because if you      
      mean to put in the whole morning in there talkin to the ladies,       
      I'll put the car in the garage and make myself agreeable with a       
      view to lunching here. If not, I'll keep the car on the go about      
      here til you come.                                                    
  TANNER. Better wait here. We shant be long. Theres a young American       
      gentleman, a Mr Malone, who is driving Mr Robinson down in his        
      new American steam car.                                               
  THE CHAUFFEUR [springing up and coming hastily out of the car to          
      Tanner] American steam car! Wot! racin us dahn from London!           
  TANNER. Perhaps theyre here already.                                      
  THE CHAUFFEUR. If I'd known it! [With deep reproach] Why didnt you        
      tell me, Mr Tanner?                                                   
  TANNER. Because Ive been told that this car is capable of 84 miles        
      an hour; and I already know what you are capable of when there        
      is a rival car on the road. No, Henry: there are things it is         
      not good for you to know; and this was one of them. However,          
      cheer up: we are going to have a day after your own heart. The        
      American is to take Mr Robinson and his sister and Miss               
      Whitefield. We are to take Miss Rhoda.                                
  THE CHAUFFEUR [consoled and musing on another matter] Thats Miss          
      Whitefield's sister, isnt it?                                         
  TANNER. Yes.                                                              
  THE CHAUFFEUR. And Miss Whitefield herself is goin in the other car?      
      Not with you?                                                         
  TANNER. Why the devil should she come with me? Mr Robinson will be        
      in the other car. [The Chauffeur looks at Tanner with cool            
      incredulity, and turns to the car, whistling a popular air            
      softly to himself. Tanner, a little annoyed, is about to pursue       
      the subject when he hears the footsteps of Octavius on the            
      gravel. Octavius is coming from the house, dressed for motoring,      
      but without his overcoat]. Weve lost the race, thank heaven:          
      heres Mr Robinson. Well, Tavy, is the steam car a success?            
  OCTAVIUS. I think so. We came from Hyde Park Corner here in               
      seventeen minutes. [The Chauffeur, furious, kicks the car with        
      a groan of vexation]. How long were you?                              
  TANNER. Oh, about three quarters of an hour or so.                        
  THE CHAUFFEUR [remonstrating] Now, now, Mr Tanner, come now! We           
      could ha done it easy under fifteen.                                  
  TANNER. By the way, let me introduce you. Mr Octavius Robinson: Mr        
      Enry Straker.                                                         
  STRAKER. Pleased to meet you, sir. Mr Tanner is gittin at you with        
      is Enry Straker, you know. You call it Henery. But I dont mind,       
      bless you!                                                            
  TANNER. You think it's simply bad taste in me to chaff him, Tavy.         
      But youre wrong. This man takes more trouble to drop his aitches      
      than ever his father did to pick them up. It's a mark of caste        
      to him. I have never met anybody more swollen with the pride of       
      class than Enry is.                                                   
  STRAKER. Easy, easy! A little moderation, Mr Tanner.                      
  TANNER. A little moderation, Tavy, you observe. You would tell me to      
      draw it mild. But this chap has been educated. Whats more, he         
      knows that we havnt. What was that Board School of yours,             
      Straker?                                                              
  STRAKER. Sherbrooke Road.                                                 
  TANNER. Sherbrooke Road! Would any of us say Rugby! Harrow! Eton! in      
      that tone of intellectual snobbery? Sherbrooke Road is a place        
      where boys learn something: Eton is a boy farm where we are sent      
      because we are nuisances at home, and because in after life,          
      whenever a Duke is mentioned, we can claim him as an old              
      school-fellow.                                                        
  STRAKER. You dont know nothing about it, Mr Tanner. It's not the          
      Board School that does it: it's the Polytechnic.                      
  TANNER. His university, Octavius. Not Oxford, Cambridge, Durham,          
      Dublin, or Glasgow. Not even those Non-conformist holes in            
      Wales. No, Tavy. Regent Street! Chelsea! the Borough!- I dont         
      know half their confounded names: these are his universities,         
      not mere shops for selling class limitations like ours. You           
      despise Oxford, Enry, dont you?                                       
  STRAKER. No, I dont. Very nice sort of place, Oxford, I should            
      think, for people that like that sort of place. They teach you        
      to be a gentleman there. In the Polytechnic they teach you to         
      be an engineer or such like. See?                                     
  TANNER. Sarcasm, Tavy, sarcasm! Oh, if you could only see into            
      Enry's soul, the depth of his contempt for a gentleman, the           
      arrogance of his pride in being an engineer, would appal you.         
      He positively likes the car to break down because it brings out       
      my gentlemanly helplessness and his workmanlike skill and             
      resource.                                                             
  STRAKER. Never you mind him, Mr Robinson. He likes to talk. We know       
      him, dont we?                                                         
  OCTAVIUS [earnestly] But theres a great truth at the bottom of what       
      he says. I believe most intensely in the dignity of labor.            
  STRAKER [unimpressed] Thats because you never done any, Mr Robinson.      
      My business is to do away with labor. Youll get more out of me        
      and a machine than you will out of twenty laborers, and not so        
      much to drink either.                                                 
  TANNER. For heaven's sake, Tavy, dont start him on political              
      economy. He knows all about it; and we dont. Youre only a poetic      
      Socialist, Tavy: he's a scientific one.                               
  STRAKER [unperturbed] Yes. Well, this conversation is very improvin;      
      but Ive got to look after the car; and you two want to talk           
      about your ladies. *I* know. [He pretends to busy himself about       
      the car, but presently saunters off to indulge in a cigaret].         
  TANNER. Thats a very momentous social phenomenon.                         
  OCTAVIUS. What is?                                                        
  TANNER. Straker is. Here have we literary and cultured persons been       
      for years setting up a cry of the New Woman whenever some             
      unusually old fashioned female came along, and never noticing         
      the advent of the New Man. Straker's the New Man.                     
  OCTAVIUS. I see nothing new about him, except your way of chaffing        
      him. But I dont want to talk about him just now. I want to speak      
      to you about Ann.                                                     
  TANNER. Straker knew even that. He learnt it at the Polytechnic,          
      probably. Well, what about Ann? Have you proposed to her?             
  OCTAVIUS [self-reproachfully] I was brute enough to do so last            
      night.                                                                
  TANNER. Brute enough! What do you mean?                                   
  OCTAVIUS [dithyrambically] Jack: we men are all coarse: we never          
      understand how exquisite a woman's sensibilities are. How could       
      I have done such a thing!                                             
  TANNER. Done what, you maudlin idiot?                                     
  OCTAVIUS. Yes, I am an idiot. Jack: if you had heard her voice! if        
      you had seen her tears! I have lain awake all night thinking of       
      them. If she had reproached me, I could have borne it better.         
  TANNER. Tears! thats dangerous. What did she say?                         
  OCTAVIUS. She asked me how she could think of anything now but her        
      dear father. She stifled a sob- [he breaks down].                     
  TANNER [patting him on the back] Bear it like a man, Tavy, even if        
      you feel it like an ass. It's the old game: she's not tired of        
      playing with you yet.                                                 
  OCTAVIUS [impatiently] Oh, dont be a fool, Jack. Do you suppose this      
      eternal shallow cynicism of yours has any real bearing on a           
      nature like hers?                                                     
  TANNER. Hm! Did she say anything else?                                    
  OCTAVIUS. Yes; and that is why I expose myself and her to your            
      ridicule by telling you what passed.                                  
  TANNER [remorsefully] No, dear Tavy, not ridicule, on my honor!           
      However, no matter. Go on.                                            
  OCTAVIUS. Her sense of duty is so devout, so perfect, so-                 
  TANNER. Yes: I know. Go on.                                               
  OCTAVIUS. You see, under this new arrangement, you and Ramsden are        
      her guardians; and she considers that all her duty to her father      
      is now transferred to you. She said she thought I ought to have       
      spoken to you both in the first instance. Of course she is            
      right; but somehow it seems rather absurd that I am to come to        
      you and formally ask to be received as a suitor for your ward's       
      hand.                                                                 
  TANNER. I am glad that love has not totally extinguished your sense       
      of humor, Tavy.                                                       
  OCTAVIUS. That answer wont satisfy her.                                   
  TANNER. My official answer is, obviously, Bless you, my children:         
      may you be happy!                                                     
  OCTAVIUS. I wish you would stop playing the fool about this. If it        
      is not serious to you, it is to me, and to her.                       
  TANNER. You know very well that she is as free to choose as you are.      
  OCTAVIUS. She does not think so.                                          
  TANNER. Oh, doesnt she! just! However, say what you want me to do?        
  OCTAVIUS. I want you to tell her sincerely and earnestly what you         
      think about me. I want you to tell her that you can trust her to      
      me- that is, if you feel you can.                                     
  TANNER. I have no doubt that I can trust her to you. What worries me      
      is the idea of trusting you to her. Have you read Maeterlinck's       
      book about the bee?                                                   
  OCTAVIUS [keeping his temper with difficulty] I am not discussing         
      literature at present.                                                
  TANNER. Be just a little patient with me. *I* am not discussing           
      literature: the book about the bee is natural history. It's an        
      awful lesson to mankind. You think that you are Ann's suitor;         
      that you are the pursuer and she the pursued; that it is your         
      part to woo, to persuade, to prevail, to overcome. Fool: it is        
      you who are the pursued, the marked down quarry, the destined         
      prey. You need not sit looking longingly at the bait through          
      the wires of the trap: the door is open, and will remain so           
      until it shuts behind you for ever.                                   
  OCTAVIUS. I wish I could believe that, vilely as you put it.              
  TANNER. Why, man, what other work has she in life but to get a            
      husband? It is a woman's business to get married as soon as           
      possible, and a man's to keep unmarried as long as he can. You        
      have your poems and your tragedies to work at: Ann has nothing.       
  OCTAVIUS. I cannot write without inspiration. And nobody can give me      
      that except Ann.                                                      
  TANNER. Well, hadnt you better get it from her at a safe distance?        
      Petrarch didnt see half as much of Laura, nor Dante of Beatrice,      
      as you see of Ann now; and yet they wrote first-rate poetry- at       
      least so I'm told. They never exposed their idolatry to the test      
      of domestic familiarity; and it lasted them to their graves.          
      Marry Ann; and at the end of a week youll find no more                
      inspiration in her than in a plate of muffins.                        
  OCTAVIUS. You think I shall tire of her!                                  
  TANNER. Not at all: you dont get tired of muffins. But you dont find      
      inspiration in them; and you wont in her when she ceases to be a      
      poet's dream and becomes a solid eleven stone wife. Youll be          
      forced to dream about somebody else; and then there will be a         
      row.                                                                  
  OCTAVIUS. This sort of talk is no use, Jack. You dont understand.         
      You have never been in love.                                          
  TANNER. I! I have never been out of it. Why, I am in love even with       
      Ann. But I am neither the slave of love nor its dupe. Go to the       
      bee, thou poet: consider her ways and be wise. By Heaven, Tavy,       
      if women could do without our work, and we ate their children's       
      bread instead of making it, they would kill us as the spider          
      kills her mate or as the bees kill the drone. And they would be       
      right if we were good for nothing but love.                           
  OCTAVIUS. Ah, if we were only good enough for Love! There is nothing      
      like Love: there is nothing else but Love: without it the world       
      would be a dream of sordid horror.                                    
  TANNER. And this- this is the man who asks me to give him the hand        
      of my ward! Tavy: I believe we were changed in our cradles, and       
      that you are the real descendant of Don Juan.                         
  OCTAVIUS. I beg you not to say anything like that to Ann.                 
  TANNER. Dont be afraid. She has marked you for her own; and nothing       
      will stop her now. You are doomed. [Straker comes back with a         
      newspaper]. Here comes the New Man, demoralizing himself with a       
      halfpenny paper as usual.                                             
  STRAKER. Now would you believe it, Mr Robinson, when we're out            
      motoring we take in two papers: the Times for him, the Leader or      
      the Echo for me. And do you think I ever see my paper? Not much.      
      He grabs the Leader and leaves me to stodge myself with his           
      Times.                                                                
  OCTAVIUS. Are there no winners in the Times?                              
  TANNER. Enry dont old with bettin, Tavy. Motor records are his            
      weakness. Whats the latest?                                           
  STRAKER. Paris to Biskra at forty mile an hour average, not countin       
      the Mediterranean.                                                    
  TANNER. How many killed?                                                  
  STRAKER. Two silly sheep. What does it matter? Sheep dont cost such       
      a lot: they were glad to ave the price without the trouble o          
      sellin em to the butcher. All the same, d'y'see, therell be a         
      clamor agin it presently; and then the French Government'll stop      
      it; an our chance'll be gone, see? Thats what makes me fairly         
      mad: Mr Tanner wont do a good run while he can.                       
  TANNER. Tavy: do you remember my uncle James?                             
  OCTAVIUS. Yes. Why?                                                       
  TANNER. Uncle James had a first rate cook: he couldnt digest              
      anything except what she cooked. Well, the poor man was shy and       
      hated society. But his cook was proud of her skill, and wanted        
      to serve up dinners to princes and ambassadors. To prevent her        
      from leaving him, that poor old man had to give a big dinner          
      twice a month, and suffer agonies of awkwardness. Now here am I;      
      and here is this chap Enry Straker, the New Man. I loathe             
      travelling; but I rather like Enry. He cares for nothing but          
      tearing along in a leather coat and goggles, with two inches of       
      dust all over him, at sixty miles an hour and the risk of his         
      life and mine. Except, of course, when he is lying on his back        
      in the mud under the machine trying to find out where it has          
      given way. Well, if I dont give him a thousand mile run at least      
      once a fortnight I shall lose him. He will give me the sack and       
      go to some American millionaire; and I shall have to put up with      
      a nice respectful groom-gardener-amateur, who will touch his hat      
      and know his place. I am Enry's slave, just as Uncle James was        
      his cook's slave.                                                     
  STRAKER [exasperated] Garn! I wish I had a car that would go as fast      
      as you can talk, Mr Tanner. What I say is that you lose money by      
      a motor car unless you keep it workin. Might as well ave a pram       
      and a nussmaid to wheel you in it as that car and me if you dont      
      git the last inch out of us both.                                     
  TANNER [soothingly] All right, Henry, all right. We'll go out for         
      half an hour presently.                                               
  STRAKER [in disgust] Arf an ahr! [He returns to his machine; seats        
      himself in it; and turns up a fresh page of his paper in search       
      of more news].                                                        
  OCTAVIUS. Oh, that reminds me. I have a note for you from Rhoda. [He      
      gives Tanner a note].                                                 
  TANNER [opening it] I rather think Rhoda is heading for a row with        
      Ann. As a rule there is only one person an English girl hates         
      more than she hates her eldest sister; and thats her mother. But      
      Rhoda positively prefers her mother to Ann. She- [indignantly]        
      Oh, I say!                                                            
  OCTAVIUS. Whats the matter?                                               
  TANNER. Rhoda was to have come with me for a ride in the motor car.       
      She says Ann has forbidden her to go out with me.                     

    Straker suddenly begins whistling his favorite air with remarkable      
deliberation. Surprised by this burst of larklike melody, and jarred        
by a sardonic note in its cheerfulness, they turn and look inquiringly      
at him. But he is busy with his paper; and nothing comes of their           
movement.                                                                   

  OCTAVIUS [recovering himself] Does she give any reason?                   
  TANNER. Reason! An insult is not a reason. Ann forbids her to be          
      alone with me on any occasion. Says I am not a fit person for a       
      young girl to be with. What do you think of your paragon now?         
  OCTAVIUS. You must remember that she has a very heavy responsibility      
      now that her father is dead. Mrs Whitefield is too weak to            
      control Rhoda.                                                        
  TANNER [staring at him] In short, you agree with Ann.                     
  OCTAVIUS. No; but I think I understand her. You must admit that your      
      views are hardly suited for the formation of a young girl's mind      
      and character.                                                        
  TANNER. I admit nothing of the sort. I admit that the formation of a      
      young lady's mind and character usually consists in telling her       
      lies; but I object to the particular lie that I am in the habit       
      of abusing the confidence of girls.                                   
  OCTAVIUS. Ann doesnt say that, Jack.                                      
  TANNER. What else does she mean?                                          
  STRAKER [catching sight of Ann coming from the house] Miss                
      Whitefield, gentlemen. [He dismounts and strolls away down the        
      avenue with the air of a man who knows he is no longer wanted].       
  ANN [coming between Octavius and Tanner] Good morning, Jack. I have       
      come to tell you that poor Rhoda has got one of her headaches         
      and cannot go out with you today in the car. It is a cruel            
      disappointment to her, poor child!                                    
  TANNER. What do you say now, Tavy?                                        
  OCTAVIUS. Surely you cannot misunderstand, Jack. Ann is shewing you       
      the kindest consideration, even at the cost of deceiving you.         
  ANN. What do you mean?                                                    
  TANNER. Would you like to cure Rhoda's headache, Ann?                     
  ANN. Of course.                                                           
  TANNER. Then tell her what you said just now; and add that you            
      arrived about two minutes after I had received her letter and         
      read it!                                                              
  ANN. Rhoda has written to you!                                            
  TANNER. With full particulars.                                            
  OCTAVIUS. Never mind him, Ann. You were right- quite right. Ann was       
      only doing her duty, Jack; and you know it. Doing it in the           
      kindest way, too.                                                     
  ANN [going to Octavius] How kind you are, Tavy! How helpful! How          
      well you understand!                                                  

    Octavius beams.                                                         

  TANNER. Ay: tighten the coils. You love her, Tavy, dont you?              
  OCTAVIUS. She knows I do.                                                 
  ANN. Hush. For shame, Tavy!                                               
  TANNER. Oh, I give you leave. I am your guardian; and I commit you        
      to Tavy's care for the next hour. I am off for a turn in the          
      car.                                                                  
  ANN. No, Jack. I must speak to you about Rhoda. Ricky: will you go        
      back to the house and entertain your American friend. He's            
      rather on Mamma's hands so early in the morning. She wants to         
      finish her housekeeping.                                              
  OCTAVIUS. I fly, dearest Ann [he kisses her hand].                        
  ANN [tenderly] Ricky Ticky Tavy!                                          

    He looks at her with an eloquent blush, and runs off.                   

  TANNER [bluntly] Now look here, Ann. This time youve landed               
      yourself; and if Tavy were not in love with you past all              
      salvation he'd have found out what an incorrigible liar you are.      
  ANN. You misunderstand, Jack. I didnt dare tell Tavy the truth.           
  TANNER. No: your daring is generally in the opposite direction. What      
      the devil do you mean by telling Rhoda that I am too vicious to       
      associate with her? How can I ever have any human or decent           
      relations with her again, now that you have poisoned her mind in      
      that abominable way?                                                  
  ANN. I know you are incapable of behaving badly-                          
  TANNER. Then why did you lie to her?                                      
  ANN. I had to.                                                            
  TANNER. Had to!                                                           
  ANN. Mother made me.                                                      
  TANNER [his eye flashing] Ha! I might have known it. The mother!          
      Always the mother!                                                    
  ANN. It was that dreadful book of yours. You know how timid mother        
      is. All timid women are conventional: we must be conventional,        
      Jack, or we are so cruelly, so vilely misunderstood. Even you,        
      who are a man, cannot say what you think without being                
      misunderstood and vilified- yes: I admit it: I have had to            
      vilify you. Do you want to have poor Rhoda misunderstood and          
      vilified in the same way? Would it be right for mother to let         
      her expose herself to such treatment before she is old enough         
      to judge for herself?                                                 
  TANNER. In short, the way to avoid misunderstanding is for everybody      
      to lie and slander and insinuate and pretend as hard as they          
      can. That is what obeying your mother comes to.                       
  ANN. I love my mother, Jack.                                              
  TANNER [working himself up into a sociological rage] Is that any          
      reason why you are not to call your soul your own? Oh, I protest      
      against this vile abjection of youth to age! Look at fashionable      
      society as you know it. What does it pretend to be? An exquisite      
      dance of nymphs. What is it? A horrible procession of wretched        
      girls, each in the claws of a cynical, cunning, avaricious,           
      disillusioned, ignorantly experienced, foul-minded old woman          
      whom she calls mother, and whose duty it is to corrupt her mind       
      and sell her to the highest bidder. Why do these unhappy slaves       
      marry anybody, however old and vile, sooner than not marry at         
      all? Because marriage is their only means of escape from these        
      decrepit fiends who hide their selfish ambitions, their jealous       
      hatreds of the young rivals who have supplanted them, under the       
      mask of maternal duty and family affection. Such things are           
      abominable: the voice of nature proclaims for the daughter a          
      father's care and for the son a mother's. The law for father and      
      son and mother and daughter is not the law of love: it is the         
      law of revolution, of emancipation, of final supersession of the      
      old and worn-out by the young and capable. I tell you, the first      
      duty of manhood and womanhood is a Declaration of Independence:       
      the man who pleads his father's authority is no man: the woman        
      who pleads her mother's authority is unfit to bear citizens to a      
      free people.                                                          
  ANN [watching him with quiet curiosity] I suppose you will go in          
      seriously for politics some day, Jack.                                
  TANNER [heavily let down] Eh? What? Wh-? [Collecting his scattered        
      wits] What has that got to do with what I have been saying?           
  ANN. You talk so well.                                                    
  TANNER. Talk! Talk! It means nothing to you but talk. Well, go back       
      to your mother, and help her to poison Rhoda's imagination as         
      she has poisoned yours. It is the tame elephants who enjoy            
      capturing the wild ones.                                              
  ANN. I am getting on. Yesterday I was a boa constrictor: today I am       
      an elephant.                                                          
  TANNER. Yes. So pack your trunk and begone: I have no more to say to      
      you.                                                                  
  ANN. You are so utterly unreasonable and impracticable. What can I        
      do?                                                                   
  TANNER. Do! Break your chains. Go your way according to your own          
      conscience and not according to your mother's. Get your mind          
      clean and vigorous; and learn to enjoy a fast ride in a motor         
      car instead of seeing nothing in it but an excuse for a               
      detestable intrigue. Come with me to Marseilles and across to         
      Algiers and to Biskra, at sixty miles an hour. Come right down        
      to the Cape if you like. That will be a Declaration of                
      Independence with a vengeance. You can write a book about it          
      afterwards. That will finish your mother and make a woman of          
      you.                                                                  
  ANN [thoughtfully] I dont think there would be any harm in that,          
      Jack. You are my guardian: you stand in my father's place, by         
      his own wish. Nobody could say a word against our travelling          
      together. It would be delightful: thank you a thousand times,         
      Jack. I'll come.                                                      
  TANNER [aghast] Youll come!!!                                             
  ANN. Of course.                                                           
  TANNER. But- [he stops, utterly appalled; then resumes feebly] No:        
      look here, Ann: if theres no harm in it theres no point in doing      
      it.                                                                   
  ANN. How absurd you are! You dont want to compromise me, do you?          
  TANNER. Yes: thats the whole sense of my proposal.                        
  ANN. You are talking the greatest nonsense; and you know it. You          
      would never do anything to hurt me.                                   
  TANNER. Well, if you dont want to be compromised, dont come.              
  ANN [with simple earnestness] Yes, I will come, Jack, since you wish      
      it. You are my guardian; and I think we ought to see more of one      
      another and come to know one another better. [Gratefully] It's        
      very thoughtful and very kind of you, Jack, to offer me this          
      lovely holiday, especially after what I said about Rhoda. You         
      really are good- much better than you think. When do we start?        
  TANNER. But-                                                              

    The conversation is interrupted by the arrival of Mrs Whitefield        
from the house. She is accompanied by the American gentleman, and           
followed by Ramsden and Octavius.                                           
    Hector Malone is an Eastern American; but he is not at all ashamed      
of his nationality. This makes English people of fashion think well of      
him, as of a young fellow who is manly enough to confess to an obvious      
disadvantage without any attempt to conceal or extenuate it. They feel      
that he ought not to be made to suffer for what is clearly not his          
fault, and make a point of being specially kind to him. His chivalrous      
manners to women, and his elevated moral sentiments, being both             
gratuitous and unusual, strike them as perhaps a little unfortunate;        
and though they find his vein of easy humor rather amusing when it has      
ceased to puzzle them (as it does at first), they have had to make him      
understand that he really must not tell anecdotes unless they are           
strictly personal and scandalous, and also that oratory is an               
accomplishment which belongs to a cruder stage of civilization than         
that in which his migration has landed him. On these points Hector          
is not quite convinced: he still thinks that the British are apt to         
make merits of their stupidities, and to represent their various            
incapacities as points of good breeding. English life seems to him          
to suffer from a lack of edifying rhetoric (which he calls moral            
tone); English behavior to shew a want of respect for womanhood;            
English pronunciation to fail very vulgarly in tackling such words          
as world, girl, bird, etc.; English society to be plain spoken to an        
extent which stretches occasionally to intolerable coarseness; and          
English intercourse to need enlivening by games and stories and             
other pastimes; so he does not feel called upon to acquire these            
defects after taking great pains to cultivate himself in a first            
rate manner before venturing across the Atlantic. To this culture he        
finds English people either totally indifferent, as they very commonly      
are to all culture, or else politely evasive, the truth being that          
Hector's culture is nothing but a state of saturation with our              
literary exports of thirty years ago, reimported by him to be unpacked      
at a moment's notice and hurled at the head of English literature,          
science, and art, at every conversational opportunity. The dismay           
set up by these sallies encourages him in his belief that he is             
helping to educate England. When he finds people chattering harmlessly      
about Anatole France and Nietzsche, he devastates them with Matthew         
Arnold, the Autocrat of the Breakfast Table, and even Macaulay; and as      
he is devoutly religious at bottom, he first leads the unwary, by           
humorous irreverence, to leave popular theology out of account in           
discussing moral questions with him, and then scatters them in              
confusion by demanding whether the carrying out of his ideals of            
conduct was not the manifest object of God Almighty in creating honest      
men and pure women. The engaging freshness of his personality and           
the dumbfoundering staleness of his culture make it extremely               
difficult to decide whether he is worth knowing; for whilst his             
company is undeniably pleasant and enlivening, there is intellectually      
nothing new to be got out of him, especially as he despises                 
politics, and is careful not to talk commercial shop, in which              
department he is probably much in advance of his English capitalist         
friends. He gets on best with romantic Christians of the amoristic          
sect: hence the friendship which has sprung up between him and              
Octavius.                                                                   
    In appearance Hector is a neatly built young man of twenty-four,        
with a short, smartly trimmed black beard, clear, well shaped eyes,         
and an ingratiating vivacity of expression. He is, from the                 
fashionable point of view, faultlessly dressed. As he comes along           
the drive from the house with Mrs Whitefield he is sedulously making        
himself agreeable and entertaining, and thereby placing on her slender      
wit a burden it is unable to hear. An Englishman would let her              
alone, accepting boredom and indifference as their common lot; and the      
poor lady wants to be either let alone or let prattle about the things      
that interest her.                                                          
    Ramsden strolls over to inspect the motor car. Octavius joins           
Hector.                                                                     

  ANN [pouncing on her mother joyously] Oh, Mamma, what do you think!       
      Jack is going to take me to Nice in his motor car. Isnt it            
      lovely? I am the happiest person in London.                           
  TANNER [desperately] Mrs Whitefield objects. I am sure she objects.       
      Doesnt she, Ramsden?                                                  
  RAMSDEN. I should think it very likely indeed.                            
  ANN. You dont object, do you, Mother?                                     
  MRS WHITEFIELD. *I* object! Why should I? I think it will do you          
      good, Ann. [Trotting over to Tanner] I meant to ask you to take       
      Rhoda out for a run occasionally: she is too much in the house;       
      but it will do when you come back.                                    
  TANNER. Abyss beneath abyss of perfidy!                                   
  ANN [hastily, to distract attention from this outburst] Oh, I             
      forgot: you have not met Mr Malone. Mr Tanner, my guardian: Mr        
      Hector Malone.                                                        
  HECTOR. Pleased to meet you, Mr Tanner. I should like to suggest an       
      extension of the travelling party to Nice, if I may.                  
  ANN. Oh, we're all coming. Thats understood, isnt it?                     
  HECTOR. I also am the mawdest possessor of a motor car. If Miss           
      Rawbnsn will allow me the privilege of taking her, my car is at       
      her service.                                                          
  OCTAVIUS. Violet!                                                         

    General constraint.                                                     

  ANN [subduedly] Come, mother: we must leave them to talk over the         
      arrangements. I must see to my travelling kit.                        

    Mrs Whitefield looks bewildered; but Ann draws her discreetly           
away; and they disappear round the corner towards the house.                

  HECTOR. I think I may go so far as to say that I can depend on Miss       
      Rawbnsn's consent.                                                    

    Continued embarrassment.                                                

  OCTAVIUS. I'm afraid we must leave Violet behind. There are               
      circumstances which make it impossible for her to come on such        
      an expedition.                                                        
  HECTOR [amused and not at all convinced] Too American, eh? Must the       
      young lady have a chaperone?                                          
  OCTAVIUS. It's not that, Malone- at least not altogether.                 
  HECTOR. Indeed! May I ask what other objection applies?                   
  TANNER [impatiently] Oh, tell him, tell him. We shall never be able       
      to keep the secret unless everybody knows what it is. Mr Malone:      
      if you go to Nice with Violet, you go with another man's wife.        
      She is married.                                                       
  HECTOR [thunderstruck] You dont tell me so!                               
  TANNER. We do. In confidence.                                             
  RAMSDEN [with an air of importance, lest Malone should suspect a          
      misalliance] Her marriage has not yet been made known: she            
      desires that it shall not be mentioned for the present.               
  HECTOR. I shall respect the lady's wishes. Would it be indiscreet to      
      ask who her husband is, in case I should have an opportunity of       
      cawnsulting him about this trip?                                      
  TANNER. We dont know who he is.                                           
  HECTOR [retiring into his shell in a very marked manner] In that          
      case, I have no more to say.                                          

    They become more embarrassed than ever.                                 

  OCTAVIUS. You must think this very strange.                               
  HECTOR. A little singular. Pardn mee for saying so.                       
  RAMSDEN [half apologetic, half huffy] The young lady was married          
      secretly; and her husband has forbidden her, it seems, to             
      declare his name. It is only right to tell you, since you are         
      interested in Miss- er- in Violet.                                    
  OCTAVIUS [sympathetically] I hope this is not a disappointment to         
      you.                                                                  
  HECTOR [softened, coming out of his shell again] Well: it is a blow.      
      I can hardly understand how a man can leave his wife in such a        
      position. Surely it's not custoMary. It's not manly. It's not         
      considerate.                                                          
  OCTAVIUS. We feel that, as you may imagine, pretty deeply.                
  RAMSDEN [testily] It is some young fool who has not enough                
      experience to know what mystifications of this kind lead to.          
  HECTOR [with strong symptoms of moral repugnance] I hope so. A man        
      need be very young and pretty foolish too to be excused for such      
      conduct. You take a very lenient view, Mr Ramsden. Too lenient        
      to my mind. Surely marriage should ennoble a man.                     
  TANNER [sardonically] Ha!                                                 
  HECTOR. Am I to gather from that cacchination that you dont agree         
      with me, Mr Tanner?                                                   
  TANNER [drily] Get married and try. You may find it delightful for a      
      while: you certainly wont find it ennobling. The greatest common      
      measure of a man and a woman is not necessarily greater than the      
      man's single measure.                                                 
  HECTOR. Well, we think in America that a woman's morl number is           
      higher than a man's, and that the purer nature of a woman lifts       
      a man right out of himself, and makes him better than he was.         
  OCTAVIUS [with conviction] So it does.                                    
  TANNER. No wonder American women prefer to live in Europe! It's more      
      comfortable than standing all their lives on an altar to be           
      worshipped. Anyhow, Violet's husband has not been ennobled. So        
      whats to be done?                                                     
  HECTOR [shaking his head] I cant dismiss that man's cawnduct as           
      lightly as you do, Mr Tanner. However, I'll say no more. Whoever      
      he is, he's Miss Rawbnsn's husband; and I should be glad for her      
      sake to think better of him.                                          
  OCTAVIUS [touched; for he divines a secret sorrow] I'm very sorry,        
      Malone. Very sorry.                                                   
  HECTOR [gratefully] Youre a good fellow, Rawbnsn. Thank you.              
  TANNER. Talk about something else. Violet's coming from the house.        
  HECTOR. I should esteem it a very great favor, gentlemen, if you          
      would take the opportunity to let me have a few words with the        
      lady alone. I shall have to cry off this trip; and it's rather a      
      dullicate-                                                            
  RAMSDEN [glad to escape] Say no more. Come, Tanner. Come, Tavy. [He       
      strolls away into the park with Octavius and Tanner, past the         
      motor car].                                                           

    Violet comes down the avenue to Hector.                                 

  VIOLET. Are they looking?                                                 
  HECTOR. No.                                                               

    She kisses him.                                                         

  VIOLET. Have you been telling lies for my sake?                           
  HECTOR. Lying! Lying hardly describes it. I overdo it. I get carried      
      away in an ecstasy of mendacity. Violet: I wish youd let me own       
      up.                                                                   
  VIOLET [instantly becoming serious and resolute] No, no, Hector: you      
      promised me not to.                                                   
  HECTOR. I'll keep my prawmis until you release me from it. But I          
      feel mean, lying to those men, and denying my wife. Just              
      dastardly.                                                            
  VIOLET. I wish your father were not so unreasonable.                      
  HECTOR. He's not unreasonable. He's right from his point of view.         
      He has a prejudice against the English middle class.                  
  VIOLET. It's too ridiculous. You know how I dislike saying such           
      things to you, Hector; but if I were to- oh, well, no matter.         
  HECTOR. I know. If you were to marry the son of an English                
      manufacturer of awffice furniture, your friends would consider        
      it a misalliance. And here's my silly old dad, who is the             
      biggest awffice furniture man in the world, would shew me the         
      door for marrying the most perfect lady in England merely             
      because she has no handle to her name. Of course it's just            
      absurd. But I tell you, Violet, I dont like deceiving him. I          
      feel as if I was stealing his money. Why wont you let me own up?      
  VIOLET. We cant afford it. You can be as romantic as you please           
      about love, Hector; but you mustnt be romantic about money.           
  HECTOR [divided between his uxoriousness and his habitual elevation       
      of moral sentiment] Thats very English. [Appealing to her             
      impulsively] Violet: Dad's bound to find us out someday.              
  VIOLET. Oh yes, later on of course. But dont lets go over this            
      everytime we meet, dear. You promised-                                
  HECTOR. All right, all right, I-                                          
  VIOLET [not to be silenced] It is I and not you who suffer by this        
      concealment; and as to facing a struggle and poverty and all          
      that sort of thing I simply will not do it. It's too silly.           
  HECTOR. You shall not. I'll sort of borrow the money from my dad          
      until I get on my own feet; and then I can own up and pay up at       
      the same time.                                                        
  VIOLET [alarmed and indignant] Do you mean to work? Do you want to        
      spoil our marriage?                                                   
  HECTOR. Well, I dont mean to let marriage spoil my character. Your        
      friend Mr Tanner has got the laugh on me a bit already about          
      that; and-                                                            
  VIOLET. The beast! I hate Jack Tanner.                                    
  HECTOR [magnanimously] Oh, hee's all right: he only needs the love        
      of a good woman to ennoble him. Besides, he's proposed a              
      motoring trip to Nice; and I'm going to take you.                     
  VIOLET. How jolly!                                                        
  HECTOR. Yes; but how are we going to manage? You see, theyve warned       
      me off going with you, so to speak. Theyve told me in cawnfidnce      
      that youre married. Thats just the most overwhelming cawnfidnce       
      Ive ever been honored with.                                           

    Tanner returns with Straker, who goes to his car.                       

  TANNER. Your car is a great success, Mr Malone. Your engineer is          
      showing it off to Mr Ramsden.                                         
  HECTOR [eagerly- forgetting himself] Lets come, Vi.                       
  VIOLET [coldly, warning him with her eyes] I beg your pardon, Mr          
      Malone: I did not quite catch-                                        
  HECTOR [recollecting himself] I ask to be allowed the pleasure of         
      shewing you my little American steam car, Miss Rawbnsn.               
  VIOLET. I shall be very pleased. [They go off together down the           
      avenue].                                                              
  TANNER. About this trip, Straker.                                         
  STRAKER [preoccupied with the car] Yes?                                   
  TANNER. Miss Whitefield is supposed to be coming with me.                 
  STRAKER. So I gather.                                                     
  TANNER. Mr Robinson is to be one of the party.                            
  STRAKER. Yes.                                                             
  TANNER. Well, if you can manage so as to be a good deal occupied          
      with me, and leave Mr Robinson a good deal occupied with Miss         
      Whitefield, he will be deeply grateful to you.                        
  STRAKER [looking round at him] Evidently.                                 
  TANNER. "Evidently"! Your grandfather would have simply winked.           
  STRAKER. My grandfather would have touched his at.                        
  TANNER. And I should have given your good nice respectful                 
      grandfather a sovereign.                                              
  STRAKER. Five shillings, more likely. [He leaves the car and              
      approaches Tanner]. What about the lady's views?                      
  TANNER. She is just as willing to be left to Mr Robinson as Mr            
      Robinson is to be left to her. [Straker looks at his principal        
      with cool scepticism; then turns to the car whistling his             
      favorite air]. Stop that aggravating noise. What do you mean by       
      it? [Straker calmly resumes the melody and finishes it. Tanner        
      politely hears it out before he again addresses Straker, this         
      time with elaborate seriousness]. Enry: I have ever been a warm       
      advocate of the spread of music among the masses; but I object        
      to your obliging the company whenever Miss Whitefield's name is       
      mentioned. You did it this morning, too.                              
  STRAKER [obstinately] It's not a bit o use. Mr Robinson may as well       
      give it up first as last.                                             
  TANNER. Why?                                                              
  STRAKER. Garn! You know why. Course it's not my business; but you         
      neednt start kiddin me about it.                                      
  TANNER. I am not kidding. I dont know why.                                
  STRAKER [cheerfully sulky] Oh, very well. All right. It aint my           
      business.                                                             
  TANNER [impressively] I trust, Enry, that, as between employer and        
      engineer, I shall always know how to keep my proper distance,         
      and not intrude my private affairs on you. Even our business          
      arrangements are subject to the approval of your Trade Union.         
      But dont abuse your advantages. Let me remind you that Voltaire       
      said that what was too silly to be said could be sung.                
  STRAKER. It wasnt Voltaire: it was Bow Mar Shay.                          
  TANNER. I stand corrected: Beaumarchais of course. Now you seem to        
      think that what is too delicate to be said can be whistled.           
      Unfortunately your whistling, though melodious, is                    
      unintelligible. Come! theres nobody listening: neither my             
      genteel relatives nor the secretary of your confounded Union. As      
      man to man, Enry, why do you think that my friend has no chance       
      with Miss Whitefield?                                                 
  STRAKER. Cause she's arter summun else.                                   
  TANNER. Bosh! who else?                                                   
  STRAKER. You.                                                             
  TANNER. Me!!!                                                             
  STRAKER. Mean to tell me you didnt know? Oh, come, Mr Tanner!             
  TANNER [in fierce earnest] Are you playing the fool, or do you mean       
      it?                                                                   
  STRAKER [with a flash of temper] I'm not playin no fool. [More            
      coolly] Why, it's as plain as the nose on your face. If you aint      
      spotted that, you dont know much about these sort of things.          
      [Serene again] Excuse me, you know, Mr Tanner; but you asked me       
      as man to man; and I told you as man to man.                          
  TANNER [wildly appealing to the heavens] Then I- *I* am the bee, the      
      spider, the marked down victim, the destined prey.                    
  STRAKER. I dunno about the bee and the spider. But the marked down        
      victim, thats what you are and no mistake; and a jolly good job       
      for you, too, I should say.                                           
  TANNER [momentously] Henry Straker: the golden moment of your life        
      has arrived.                                                          
  STRAKER. What d'y'mean?                                                   
  TANNER. That record to Biskra.                                            
  STRAKER [eagerly] Yes?                                                    
  TANNER. Break it.                                                         
  STRAKER [rising to the height of his destiny] D'y'mean it?                
  TANNER. I do.                                                             
  STRAKER. When?                                                            
  TANNER. Now. Is that machine ready to start?                              
  STRAKER [quailing] But you cant-                                          
  TANNER [cutting him short by getting into the car] Off we go. First       
      to the bank for money; then to my rooms for my kit; then to your      
      rooms for your kit; then break the record from London to Dover        
      or Folkestone; then across the channel and away like mad to           
      Marseilles, Gibraltar, Genoa, any port from which we can sail to      
      a Mahometan country where men are protected from women.               
  STRAKER. Garn! youre kiddin.                                              
  TANNER [resolutely] Stay behind then. If you wont come I'll do it         
      alone. [He starts the motor].                                         
  STRAKER [running after him] Here! Mister! arf a mo! steady on! [He        
      scrambles in as the car plunges forward].                             


                              ACT THREE                                     

    Evening in the Sierra Nevada. Rolling slopes of brown with olive        
trees instead of apple trees in the cultivated patches, and occasional      
prickly pears instead of gorse and bracken in the wilds. Higher up,         
tall stone peaks and precipices, all handsome and distinguished. No         
wild nature here: rather a most aristocratic mountain landscape made        
by a fastidious artist-creator. No vulgar profusion of vegetation:          
even a touch of aridity in the frequent patches of stones: Spanish          
magnificence and Spanish economy everywhere.                                
    Not very far north of a spot at which the high road over one of         
the passes crosses a tunnel on the railway from Malaga to Granada,          
is one of the mountain amphitheatres of the Sierra. Looking at it from      
the wide end of the horse-shoe, one sees, a little to the right, in         
the face of the cliff, a romantic cave which is really an abandoned         
quarry, and towards the left a little hill, commanding a view of the        
road, which skirts the amphitheatre on the left, maintaining its            
higher level on embankments and an occasional stone arch. On the hill,      
watching the road, is a man who is either a Spaniard or a Scotchman.        
Probably a Spaniard, since he wears the dress of a Spanish goatherd         
and seems at home in the Sierra Nevada, but very like a Scotchman           
for all that. In the hollow, on the slope leading to the                    
quarry-cave, are about a dozen men who, as they recline at their            
ease round a heap of smouldering white ashes of dead leaf and               
brushwood, have an air of being conscious of themselves as picturesque      
scoundrels honoring the Sierra by using it as an effective pictorial        
background. As a matter of artistic fact they are not picturesque; and      
the mountains tolerate them as lions tolerate lice. An English              
policeman or Poor Law Guardian would recognize them as a selected hand      
of tramps and ablebodied paupers.                                           
    This description of them is not wholly contemptuous. Whoever has        
intelligently observed the tramp, or visited the ablebodied ward of         
a workhouse, will admit that our social failures are not all drunkards      
and weaklings. Some of them are men who do not fit the class they were      
born into. Precisely the same qualities that make the educated              
gentleman an artist may make an uneducated manual laborer an                
ablebodied pauper. There are men who fall helplessly into the               
workhouse because they are good for nothing; but there are also men         
who are there because they are strongminded enough to disregard the         
social convention (obviously not a disinterested one on the part of         
the ratepayer) which bids a man live by heavy and badly paid                
drudgery when he has the alternative of walking into the workhouse,         
announcing himself as a destitute person, and legally compelling the        
Guardians to feed, clothe, and house him better than he could feed,         
clothe, and house himself without great exertion. When a man who is         
born a poet refuses a stool in a stockbroker's office, and starves          
in a garret, spunging on a poor landlady or on his friends and              
relatives sooner than work against his grain; or when a lady,               
because she is a lady, will face any extremity of parasitic dependence      
rather than take a situation as cook or parlormaid, we make large           
allowances for them. To such allowances the ablebodied pauper, and his      
nomadic variant the tramp, are equally entitled.                            
    Further, the imaginative man, if his life is to be tolerable to         
him, must have leisure to tell himself stories, and a position which        
lends itself to imaginative decoration. The ranks of unskilled labor        
offer no such positions. We misuse our laborers horribly; and when a        
man refuses to he misused, we have no right to say that he is refusing      
honest work. Let us be frank in this matter before we go on with our        
play; so that we may enjoy it without hypocrisy. If we were reasoning,      
far-sighted people, four fifths of us would go straight to the              
Guardians for relief, and knock the whole social system to pieces with      
most beneficial reconstructive results. The reason we do not do this        
is because we work like bees or ants, by instinct or habit, not             
reasoning about the matter at all. Therefore when a man comes along         
who can and does reason, and who, applying the Kantian test to his          
conduct, can truly say to us, If everybody did as I do, the world           
would be compelled to reform itself industrially, and abolish               
slavery and squalor, which exist only because everybody does as you         
do, let us honor that man and seriously consider the advisability of        
following his example. Such a man is the ablebodied, ableminded             
pauper. Were he a gentleman doing his best to get a pension or a            
sinecure instead of sweeping a crossing, nobody would blame him for         
deciding that so long as the alternative lies between living mainly at      
the expense of the community and allowing the community to live mainly      
at his, it would be folly to accept what is to him personally the           
greater of the two evils.                                                   
    We may therefore contemplate the tramps of the Sierra without           
prejudice, admitting cheerfully that our objects- briefly, to be            
gentlemen of fortune- are much the same as theirs, and the                  
difference in our position and methods merely accidental. One or two        
of them, perhaps, it would be wiser to kill without malice in a             
friendly and frank manner; for there are bipeds, just as there are          
quadrupeds, who are too dangerous to be left unchained and                  
unmuzzled; and these cannot fairly expect to have other men's lives         
wasted in the work of watching them. But as society has not the             
courage to kill them, and, when it catches them, simply wreaks on them      
some superstitious expiatory rites of torture and degradation, and          
then lets them loose with heightened qualifications for mischief, it        
is just as well that they are at large in the Sierra, and in the hands      
of a chief who looks as if he might possibly, on provocation, order         
them to be shot.                                                            
    This chief, seated in the centre of the group on a squared block        
of stone from the quarry, is a tall strong man, with a striking             
cockatoo nose, glossy black hair, pointed beard, upturned moustache,        
and a Mephistophelean affectation which is fairly imposing, perhaps         
because the scenery admits of a larger swagger than Piccadilly,             
perhaps because of a certain sentimentality in the man which gives him      
that touch of grace which alone can excuse deliberate picturesqueness.      
His eyes and mouth are by no means rascally; he has a fine voice and a      
ready wit; and whether he is really the strongest man in the patty          
or not, he looks it. He is certainly the best fed, the best dressed,        
and the best trained. The fact that he speaks English is not                
unexpected, in spite of the Spanish landscape; for with the                 
exception of one man who might be guessed as a bullfighter ruined by        
drink, and one unmistakeable Frenchman, they are all cockney or             
American; therefore, in a land of cloaks and sombreros, they mostly         
wear seedy overcoats, woollen mufflers, hard hemispherical hats, and        
dirty brown gloves. Only a very few dress after their leader, whose         
broad sombrero with a cock's feather in the band, and voluminous cloak      
descending to his high boots, are as un-English as possible. None of        
them are armed; and the ungloved ones keep their hands in their             
pockets because it is their national belief that it must be                 
dangerously cold in the open air with the night coming on. (It is as        
warm an evening as any reasonable man could desire.)                        
    Except the bullfighting inebriate there is only one person in           
the company who looks more than, say, thirty-three, He is a small           
man with reddish whiskers, weak eyes, and the anxious look of a             
small tradesman in difficulties. He wears the only tall hat visible:        
it shines in the sunset with the sticky glow of some sixpenny patent        
hat reviver, often applied and constantly tending to produce a worse        
state of the original surface than the ruin it was applied to               
remedy. He has a collar and cuffs of celluloid; and his brown               
Chesterfield overcoat, with velvet collar, is still presentable. He is      
pre-eminently the respectable man of the party, and is certainly            
over forty, possibly over fifty. He is the corner man on the                
leader's right, opposite three men in scarlet ties on his left. One of      
these three is the Frenchman. Of the remaining two, who are both            
English, one is argumentative, solemn, and obstinate; the other             
rowdy and mischievous.                                                      
    The chief, with a magnificent fling of the end of his cloak across      
his left shoulder, rises to address them. The applause which greets         
him shews that he is a favorite orator.                                     

  THE CHIEF. Friends and fellow brigands. I have a proposal to make to      
      this meeting. We have now spent three evenings in discussing the      
      question Have Anarchists or Social-Democrats the most personal        
      courage? We have gone into the principles of Anarchism and            
      Social-Democracy at great length. The cause of Anarchy has been       
      ably represented by our one Anarchist, who doesnt know what           
      Anarchism means [laughter]-                                           
  THE ANARCHIST [rising] A point of order, Mendoza-                         
  MENDOZA [forcibly] No, by thunder: your last point of order took          
      half an hour. Besides, Anarchists dont believe in order.              
  THE ANARCHIST [mild, polite but persistent: he is, in fact, the           
      respectable looking elderly man in the celluloid collar and           
      cuffs] That is a vulgar error. I can prove-                           
  MENDOZA. Order, order.                                                    
  THE OTHERS [shouting] Order, order. Sit down. Chair! Shut up.             

    The Anarchist is suppressed.                                            

  MENDOZA. On the other hand we have three Social-Democrats among us.       
      They are not on speaking terms; and they have put before us           
      three distinct and incompatible views of Social-Democracy.            
  THE THREE MEN IN SCARLET TIES. 1. Mr Chairman, I protest. A personal      
      explanation. 2. It's a lie. I never said so. Be fair, Mendoza.        
      3. Je demande la parole. C'est absolument faux. C'est faux!           
      faux!! faux!!! Assas-s-s-s-sin!!!!!!                                  
  MENDOZA. Order, order.                                                    
  THE OTHERS. Order, order, order! Chair!                                   

    The Social-Democrats are suppressed.                                    

  MENDOZA. Now, we tolerate all opinions here. But after all,               
      comrades, the vast majority of us are neither Anarchists nor          
      Socialists, but gentlemen and Christians.                             
  THE MAJORITY [shouting assent] Hear, hear! So we are. Right.              
  THE ROWDY SOCIAL-DEMOCRAT [smarting under suppression] You aint no        
      Christian. Youre a Sheeny, you are.                                   
  MENDOZA [with crushing magnanimity] My friend: I am an exception to       
      all rules. It is true that I have the honor to be a Jew; and          
      when the Zionists need a leader to reassemble our race on its         
      historic soil of Palestine, Mendoza will not be the last to           
      volunteer [sympathetic applause- Hear, hear, etc.]. But I am not      
      a slave to any superstition. I have swallowed all the formulas,       
      even that of Socialism; though, in a sense, once a Socialist,         
      always a Socialist.                                                   
  THE SOCIAL-DEOMCRATS. Hear, hear!                                         
  MENDOZA. But I am well aware that the ordinary man- even the              
      ordinary brigand, who can scarcely be called an ordinary man          
      [Hear, hear!]- is not a philosopher. Common sense is good enough      
      for him; and in our business affairs common sense is good enough      
      for me. Well, what is our business here in the Sierra Nevada,         
      chosen by the Moors as the fairest spot in Spain? Is it to            
      discuss abstruse questions of political economy? No: it is to         
      hold up motor cars and secure a more equitable distribution of        
      wealth.                                                               
  THE SULKY SOCIAL-DEMOCRAT. All made by labor, mind you.                   
  MENDOZA [urbanely] Undoubtedly. All made by labor, and on its way to      
      be squandered by wealthy vagabonds in the dens of vice that           
      disfigure the sunny shores of the Mediterranean. We intercept         
      that wealth. We restore it to circulation among the class that        
      produced it and that chiefly needs it: the working class. We do       
      this at the risk of our lives and liberties, by the exercise of       
      the virtues of courage, endurance, foresight, and abstinence-         
      especially abstinence. I myself have eaten nothing but prickly        
      pears and broiled rabbit for three days.                              
  THE SULKY SOCIAL-DEMOCRAT [stubbornly] No more aint we.                   
  MENDOZA [indignantly] Have I taken more than my share?                    
  THE SULKY SOCIAL-DEMOCRAT [unmoved] Why should you?                       
  THE ANARCHIST. Why should he not? To each according to his needs:         
      from each according to his means.                                     
  THE FRENCHMAN [shaking his fist at the Anarchist] Fumiste!                
  MENDOZA [diplomatically] I agree with both of you.                        
  THE GENUINELY ENGLISH BRIGANDS. Hear, hear! Bravo Mendoza!                
  MENDOZA. What I say is, let us treat one another as gentlemen, and        
      strive to excel in personal courage only when we take the field.      
  THE ROWDY SOCIAL-DEMOCRAT [derisively] Shikespear.                        

    A whistle comes from the goatherd on the hill. He springs up and        
points excitedly forward along the road to the north.                       

  THE GOATHERD. Automobile! Automobile! [He rushes down the hill and        
      joins the rest, who all scramble to their feet].                      
  MENDOZA [in ringing tones] To arms! Who has the gun?                      
  THE SULKY SOCIAL-DEMOCRAT [handing the rifle to Mendoza] Here.            
  MENDOZA. Have the nails been strewn in the road?                          
  THE ROWDY SOCIAL-DEMOCRAT. Two ahnces of em.                              
  MENDOZA. Good! [To the Frenchman] With me, Duval. If the nails fail,      
      puncture their tires with a bullet. [He gives the rifle to            
      Duval, who follows him up the hill. Mendoza produces an opera         
      glass. The others hurry across to the road and disappear to the       
      north].                                                               
  MENDOZA [on the hill, using his glass] Two only, a capitalist and         
      his chauffeur. They look English.                                     
  DUVAL. Angliche! Aoh yess. Cochons! [Handling the rifle] Faut tirer,      
      n'est-ce-pas?                                                         
  MENDOZA. No: the nails have gone home. Their tire is down: they           
      stop.                                                                 
  DUVAL [shouting to the others] Fondez sur eux, nom de Dieu!               
  MENDOZA [rebuking his excitement] Du calme, Duval: keep your hair         
      on. They take it quietly. Let us descend and receive them.            

    Mendoza descends, passing behind the fire and coming forward,           
whilst Tanner and Straker, in their motoring goggles, leather coats,        
and caps, are led in from the road by the brigands.                         

  TANNER. Is this the gentleman you describe as your boss? Does he          
      speak English?                                                        
  THE ROWDY SOCIAL-DEMOCRAT. Course e daz. Y' downt suppowz we              
      Hinglishmen luts ahrselves be bossed by a bloomin Spenniard, do       
      you?                                                                  
  MENDOZA [with dignity] Allow me to introduce myself. Mendoza,             
      President of the League of the Sierra! [Posing loftily] I am a        
      brigand: I live by robbing the rich.                                  
  TANNER [promptly] I am a gentleman: I live by robbing the poor.           
      Shake hands.                                                          
  THE ENGLISH SOCIAL-DEMOCRATS. Hear, hear!                                 

    General laughter and good humor. Tanner and Mendoza shake hands.        
The Brigands drop into their former places.                                 

  STRAKER. Ere! where do I come in?                                         
  TANNER [introducing] My friend and chauffeur.                             
  THE SULKY SOCIAL-DEMOCRAT [suspiciously] Well, which is he? friend        
      or show-foor? It makes all the difference, you know.                  
  MENDOZA [explaining] We should expect ransom for a friend. A              
      professional chauffeur is free of the mountains. He even takes a      
      trifling percentage of his principal's ransom if he will honor        
      us by accepting it.                                                   
  STRAKER. I see. Just to encourage me to come this way again. Well,        
      I'll think about it.                                                  
  DUVAL [impulsively rushing across to Straker] Mon frere! [He              
      embraces him rapturously and kisses him on both cheeks].              
  STRAKER [disgusted] Ere, git aht: dont be silly. Who are you, pray?       
  DUVAL. Duval: Social-Democrat.                                            
  STRAKER. Oh, youre a Social-Democrat, are you?                            
  THE ANARCHIST. He means that he has sold out to the parliamentary         
      humbugs and the bourgeoisie. Compromise! that is his faith.           
  DUVAL [furiously] I understand what he say. He say Bourgeois. He say      
      Compromise. Jamais de la vie! Miserable menteur-                      
  STRAKER. See here, Captain Mendoza, ah mach o this sort o thing do        
      you put up with here? Are we avin a pleasure trip in the              
      mountains, or are we at a Socialist meetin?                           
  THE MAJORITY. Hear, hear! Shut up. Chuck it. Sit down, etc., etc.         
      [The Social-Democrats and the Anarchist are hustled into the          
      background. Straker, after superintending this proceeding with        
      satisfaction, places himself on Mendoza's left, Tanner being on       
      his right].                                                           
  MENDOZA. Can we offer you anything? Broiled rabbit and prickly            
      pears-                                                                
  TANNER. Thank you: we have dined.                                         
  MENDOZA [to his followers] Gentlemen: business is over for the day.       
      Go as you please until morning.                                       

    The Brigands disperse into groups lazily. Some go into the cave.        
Others sit down or lie down to sleep in the open. A few produce a pack      
of cards and move off towards the road; for it is now starlight; and        
they know that motor cars have lamps which can be turned to account         
for lighting a card party.                                                  

  STRAKER [calling after them] Dont none of you go fooling with that        
      car, d'ye hear?                                                       
  MENDOZA. No fear, Monsieur le Chauffeur. The first one we captured        
      cured us of that.                                                     
  STRAKER [interested] What did it do?                                      
  MENDOZA. It carried three brave comrades of ours, who did not know        
      how to stop it, into Granada, and capsized them opposite the          
      police station. Since then we never touch one without sending         
      for the chauffeur. Shall we chat at our ease?                         
  TANNER. By all means.                                                     

    Tanner, Mendoza, and Straker sit down on the turf by the fire.          
Mendoza delicately waives his presidential dignity, of which the right      
to sit on the squared stone block is the appanage, by sitting on the        
ground like his guests, and using the stone only as a support for           
his back.                                                                   

  MENDOZA. It is the custom in Spain always to put off business until       
      tomorrow. In fact, you have arrived out of office hours.              
      However, if you would prefer to settle the question of ransom         
      at once, I am at your service.                                        
  TANNER. Tomorrow will do for me. I am rich enough to pay anything in      
      reason.                                                               
  MENDOZA [respectfully, much struck by this admission] You are a           
      remarkable man, sir. Our guests usually describe themselves as        
      miserably poor.                                                       
  TANNER. Pooh! Miserably poor people dont own motor cars.                  
  MENDOZA. Precisely what we say to them.                                   
  TANNER. Treat us well: we shall not prove ungrateful.                     
  STRAKER. No prickly pears and broiled rabbits, you know. Dont tell        
      me you cant do us a bit better than that if you like.                 
  MENDOZA. Wine, kids, milk, cheese, and bread can be procured for          
      ready money.                                                          
  STRAKER [graciously] Now youre talkin.                                    
  TANNER. Are you all Socialists here, may I ask?                           
  MENDOZA [repudiating this humiliating misconception] Oh no, no, no:       
      nothing of the kind, I assure you. We naturally have modern           
      views as to the injustice of the existing distribution of             
      wealth: otherwise we should lose our self-respect. But nothing        
      that you could take exception to, except two or three faddists.       
  TANNER. I had no intention of suggesting anything discreditable. In       
      fact, I am a bit of a Socialist myself.                               
  STRAKER [drily] Most rich men are, I notice.                              
  MENDOZA. Quite so. It has reached us, I admit. It is in the air of        
      the century.                                                          
  STRAKER. Socialism must be lookin up a bit if your chaps are taking       
      to it.                                                                
  MENDOZA. That is true, sir. A movement which is confined to               
      philosophers and honest men can never exercise any real               
      political influence: there are too few of them. Until a movement      
      shews itself capable of spreading among brigands, it can never        
      hope for a political majority.                                        
  TANNER. But are your brigands any less honest than ordinary               
      citizens?                                                             
  MENDOZA. Sir: I will be frank with you. Brigandage is abnormal.           
      Abnormal professions attract two classes: those who are not good      
      enough for ordinary bourgeois life and those who are too good         
      for it. We are dregs and scum, sir: the dregs very filthy, the        
      scum very superior.                                                   
  STRAKER. Take care! some o the dregs'll hear you.                         
  MENDOZA. It does not matter: each brigand thinks himself scum, and        
      likes to hear the others called dregs.                                
  TANNER. Come! you are a wit. [Mendoza inclines his head, flattered].      
      May one ask you a blunt question?                                     
  MENDOZA. As blunt as you please.                                          
  TANNER. How does it pay a man of your talent to shepherd such a           
      flock as this on broiled rabbit and prickly pears? I have seen        
      men less gifted, and I'll swear less honest, supping at the           
      Savoy on foie gras and champagne.                                     
  MENDOZA. Pooh! they have all had their turn at the broiled rabbit,        
      just as I shall have my turn at the Savoy. Indeed, I have had a       
      turn there already- as waiter.                                        
  TANNER. A waiter! You astonish me!                                        
  MENDOZA [reflectively] Yes: I, Mendoza of the Sierra, was a waiter.       
      Hence, perhaps, my cosmopolitanism. [With sudden intensity]           
      Shall I tell you the story of my life?                                
  STRAKER [apprehensively] If it aint too long, old chap-                   
  TANNER [interrupting him] Tsh-sh: you are a Philistine, Henry: you        
      have no romance in you. [To Mendoza] You interest me extremely,       
      President. Never mind Henry: he can go to sleep.                      
  MENDOZA. The woman I loved-                                               
  STRAKER. Oh, this is a love story, is it? Right you are. Go on: I         
      was only afraid you were going to talk about yourself.                
  MENDOZA. Myself! I have thrown myself away for her sake: that is why      
      I am here. No matter: I count the world well lost for her. She        
      had, I pledge you my word, the most magnificent head of hair I        
      ever saw. She had humor; she had intellect; she could cook to         
      perfection; and her highly strung temperament made her                
      uncertain, incalculable, variable, capricious, cruel, in a word,      
      enchanting.                                                           
  STRAKER. A six shillin novel sort o woman, all but the cookin. Er         
      name was Lady Gladys Plantagenet, wasnt it?                           
  MENDOZA. No, sir: she was not an earl's daughter. Photography,            
      reproduced by the half-tone process, has made me familiar with        
      the appearance of the daughters of the English peerage; and I         
      can honestly say that I would have sold the lot, faces, dowries,      
      clothes, titles, and all, for a smile from this woman. Yet she        
      was a woman of the people, a worker: otherwise- let me                
      reciprocate your bluntness- I should have scorned her.                
  TANNER. Very properly. And did she respond to your love?                  
  MENDOZA. Should I be here if she did? She objected to marry a Jew.        
  TANNER. On religious grounds?                                             
  MENDOZA. No: she was a freethinker. She said that every Jew               
      considers in his heart that English people are dirty in their         
      habits.                                                               
  TANNER [surprised] Dirty!                                                 
  MENDOZA. It shewed her extraordinary knowledge of the world; for it       
      is undoubtedly true. Our elaborate sanitary code makes us unduly      
      contemptuous of the Gentile.                                          
  TANNER. Did you ever hear that, Henry?                                    
  STRAKER. Ive heard my sister say so. She was cook in a Jewish family      
      once.                                                                 
  MENDOZA. I could not deny it; neither could I eradicate the               
      impression it made on her mind. I could have got round any other      
      objection; but no woman can stand a suspicion of indelicacy as        
      to her person. My entreaties were in vain: she always retorted        
      that she wasnt good enough for me, and recommended me to marry        
      an accursed barmaid named Rebecca Lazarus, whom I loathed. I          
      talked of suicide: she offered me a packet of beetle poison to        
      do it with. I hinted at murder: she went into hysterics; and as       
      I am a living man I went to America so that she might sleep           
      without dreaming that I was stealing upstairs to cut her throat.      
      In America I went out west and fell in with a man who was wanted      
      by the police for holding up trains. It was he who had the idea       
      of holding up motor cars in the South of Europe: a welcome idea       
      to a desperate and disappointed man. He gave me some valuable         
      introductions to capitalists of the right sort. I formed a            
      syndicate; and the present enterprise is the result. I became         
      leader, as the Jew always becomes leader, by his brains and           
      imagination. But with all my pride of race I would give               
      everything I possess to be an Englishman. I am like a boy: I cut      
      her name on the trees and her initials on the sod. When I am          
      alone I lie down and tear my wretched hair and cry Louisa-            
  STRAKER [startled] Louisa!                                                
  MENDOZA. It is her name- Louisa- Louisa Straker-                          
  TANNER. Straker!                                                          
  STRAKER [scrambling up on his knees most indignantly] Look here:          
      Louisa Straker is my sister, see? Wot do you mean by gassin           
      about her like this? Wotshe got to do with you?                       
  MENDOZA. A dramatic coincidence! You are Enry, her favorite brother!      
  STRAKER. Oo are you callin Enry? What call have you to take a             
      liberty with my name or with hers? For two pins I'd punch your        
      fat edd, so I would.                                                  
  MENDOZA [with grandiose calm] If I let you do it, will you promise        
      to brag of it afterwards to her? She will be reminded of her          
      Mendoza: that is all I desire.                                        
  TANNER. This is genuine devotion, Henry. You should respect it.           
  STRAKER [fiercely] Funk, more likely.                                     
  MENDOZA [springing to his feet] Funk! Young man: I come of a famous       
      family of fighters; and as your sister well knows, you would          
      have as much chance against me as a perambulator against your         
      motor car.                                                            
  STRAKER [secretly daunted, but rising from his knees with an air of       
      reckless pugnacity] I aint afraid of you. With your Louisa!           
      Louisa! Miss Straker is good enough for you, I should think.          
  MENDOZA. I wish you could persuade her to think so.                       
  STRAKER [exasperated] Here-                                               
  TANNER [rising quickly and interposing] Oh come, Henry: even if you       
      could fight the President you cant fight the whole League of the      
      Sierra. Sit down again and be friendly. A cat may look at a           
      king; and even a President of brigands may look at your sister.       
      All this family pride is really very old fashioned.                   
  STRAKER [subdued, but grumbling] Let him look at her. But wot does        
      he mean by makin out that she ever looked at im? [Reluctantly         
      resuming his couch on the turf] Ear him talk, one ud think she        
      was keepin company with him. [He turns his back on them and           
      composes himself to sleep].                                           
  MENDOZA [to Tanner, becoming more confidential as he finds himself        
      virtually alone with a sympathetic listener in the still              
      starlight of the mountains, for all the rest are asleep by this       
      time] It was just so with her, sir. Her intellect reached             
      forward into the twentieth century: her social prejudices and         
      family affections reached back into the dark ages. Ah, sir, how       
      the words of Shakespear seem to fit every crisis in our               
      emotions!                                                             

              I loved Louisa: 40,000 brothers                               
              Could not with all their quantity of love                     
              Make up my sum.                                               

      And so on. I forget the rest. Call it madness if you will-            
      infatuation. I am an able man, a strong man: in ten years I           
      should have owned a first-class hotel. I met her; and- you see!-      
      I am a brigand, an outcast. Even Shakespear cannot do justice         
      to what I feel for Louisa. Let me read you some lines that I          
      have written about her myself. However slight their literary          
      merit may be, they express what I feel better than any casual         
      words can. [He produces a packet of hotel bills, scrawled with        
      manuscript, and kneels at the fire to decipher them, poking it        
      with a stick to make it glow].                                        
  TANNER [slapping him rudely on the shoulder] Put them in the fire,        
      President.                                                            
  MENDOZA [startled] Eh?                                                    
  TANNER. You are sacrificing your career to a monomania.                   
  MENDOZA. I know it.                                                       
  TANNER. No you dont. No man would commit such a crime against             
      himself if he really knew what he was doing. How can you look         
      round at these august hills, look up at this divine sky, taste        
      this finely tempered air, and then talk like a literary hack on       
      a second floor in Bloomsbury?                                         
  MENDOZA [shaking his head] The Sierra is no better than Bloomsbury        
      when once the novelty has worn off. Besides, these mountains          
      make you dream of women- of women with magnificent hair.              
  TANNER. Of Louisa, in short. They will not make me dream of women,        
      my friend: I am heartwhole.                                           
  MENDOZA. Do not boast until morning, sir. This is a strange country       
      for dreams.                                                           
  TANNER. Well, we shall see. Goodnight. [He lies down and composes         
      himself to sleep].                                                    

    Mendoza, with a sigh, follows his example: and for a few moments        
there is peace in the Sierra. Then Mendoza sits up suddenly and says        
pleadingly to Tanner-                                                       

  MENDOZA. Just allow me to read a few lines before you go to sleep. I      
      should really like your opinion of them.                              
  TANNER [drowsily] Go on. I am listening.                                  
  MENDOZA.         I saw thee first in Whitsun week                         
                   Louisa, Louisa-                                          

  TANNER [rousing himself] My dear President, Louisa is a very pretty       
      name; but it really doesnt rhyme well to Whitsun week.                
  MENDOZA. Of course not. Louisa is not the rhyme, but the refrain.         
  TANNER [subsiding] Ah, the refrain. I beg your pardon. Go on.             
  MENDOZA. Perhaps you do not care for that one: I think you will like      
    this better. [He recites, in rich soft tones, and in slow time]         

          Louisa, I love thee.                                              
          I love thee, Louisa.                                              
          Louisa, Louisa, Louisa, I love thee.                              
          One name and one phrase make my music, Louisa.                    
          Louisa, Louisa, Louisa, I love thee.                              

          Mendoza thy lover,                                                
          Thy lover, Mendoza,                                               
          Mendoza adoringly lives for Louisa.                               
          Theres nothing but that in the world for Mendoza.                 
          Louisa, Louisa, Mendoza adores thee.                              

      [Affected] There is no merit in producing beautiful lines upon        
      such a name. Louisa is an exquisite name, is it not?                  
  TANNER [all but asleep, responds with faint groan].                       
  MENDOZA.   O wert thou, Louisa,                                           
             The wife of Mendoza,                                           
             Mendoza's Louisa, Louisa Mendoza,                              
             How blest were the life of Louisa's Mendoza!                   
             How painless his longing of love for Louisa!                   

      That is real poetry- from the heart- from the heart of hearts.        
      Dont you think it will move her?                                      

    No answer.                                                              

      [Resignedly] Asleep, as usual. Doggrel to all the world:              
      heavenly music to me! Idiot that I am to wear my heart on my          
      sleeve! [He composes himself to sleep, murmuring] Louisa, I love      
      thee; I love thee, Louisa; Louisa, Louisa, Louisa, I-                 

    Straker snores; rolls over on his side; and relapses into sleep.        
Stillness settles on the Sierra; and the darkness deepens. The fire         
has again buried itself in white ash and ceased to glow. The peaks          
shew unfathomably dark against the starry firmament; but now the stars      
dim and vanish; and the sky seems to steal away out of the universe.        
Instead of the Sierra there is nothing: omnipresent nothing. No sky,        
no peaks, no light, no sound, no time nor space, utter void. Then           
somewhere the beginning of a pallor, and with it a faint throbbing          
buzz as of a ghostly violoncello palpitating on the same note               
endlessly. A couple of ghostly violins presently take advantage of          
this bass (see illustration):                                               
    and therewith the pallor reveals a man in the void, an incorporeal      
but visible man, seated, absurdly enough, on nothing. For a moment          
he raises his head as the music passes him by. Then, with a heavy           
sigh, he droops in utter dejection; and the violins, discouraged,           
retrace their melody in despair and at last give it up, extinguished        
by wailings from uncanny wind instruments, thus (see                        
illustration):-                                                             
    It is all very odd. One recognizes the Mozartian strain; and on         
this hint, and by the aid of certain sparkles of violet light in the        
pallor, the man's costume explains itself as that of a Spanish              
nobleman of the XV-XVI century. Don Juan, of course; but where? why?        
how? Besides, in the brief lifting of his face, now hidden by his           
hat brim, there was a curious suggestion of Tanner. A more critical,        
fastidious, handsome face, paler and colder, without Tanner's               
impetuous credulity and enthusiasm, and without a touch of his              
modern plutocratic vulgarity, but still a resemblance, even an              
identity. The name too: Don Juan Tenorio, John Tanner. Where on earth-      
or elsewhere- have we got to from the XX century and the Sierra?            
    Another pallor in the void, this time not violet, but a                 
disagreeable smoky yellow. With it, the whisper of a ghostly                
clarinet turning this tune into infinite sadness (see                       
illustration):                                                              
    The yellowish pallor moves: there is an old crone wandering in the      
void, bent and toothless; draped, as well as one can guess, in the          
coarse brown frock of some religious order. She wanders and wanders in      
her slow hopeless way, much as a wasp flies in its rapid busy way,          
until she blunders against the thing she seeks: companionship. With         
a sob of relief the poor old creature clutches at the presence of           
the man and addresses him in her dry unlovely voice, which can still        
express pride and resolution as well as suffering.                          

  THE OLD WOMAN. Excuse me; but I am so lonely; and this place is so        
      awful.                                                                
  DON JUAN. A new comer?                                                    
  THE OLD WOMAN. Yes: I suppose I died this morning. I confessed; I         
      had extreme unction; I was in bed with my family about me and my      
      eyes fixed on the cross. Then it grew dark; and when the light        
      came back it was this light by which I walk seeing nothing. I         
      have wandered for hours in horrible loneliness.                       
  DON JUAN [sighing] Ah! you have not yet lost the sense of time. One       
      soon does, in eternity.                                               
  THE OLD WOMAN. Where are we?                                              
  DON JUAN. In hell.                                                        
  THE OLD WOMAN [proudly] Hell! I in hell! How dare you?                    
  DON JUAN [unimpressed] Why not, Senora!                                   
  THE OLD WOMAN. You do not know to whom you are speaking. I am a           
      lady, and a faithful daughter of the Church.                          
  DON JUAN. I do not doubt it.                                              
  THE OLD WOMAN. But how then can I be in hell? Purgatory, perhaps: I       
      have not been perfect: who has? But hell! oh, you are lying.          
  DON JUAN. Hell, Senora, I assure you; hell at its best: that is, its      
      most solitary- though perhaps you would prefer company.               
  THE OLD WOMAN. But I have sincerely repented; I have confessed-           
  DON JUAN. How much?                                                       
  THE OLD WOMAN. More sins than I really committed. I loved                 
      confession.                                                           
  DON JUAN. Ah, that is perhaps as bad as confessing too little. At         
      all events, Senora, whether by oversight or intention, you are        
      certainly damned, like myself; and there is nothing for it now        
      but to make the best of it.                                           
  THE OLD WOMAN [indignantly] Oh! and I might have been so much             
      wickeder! All my good deeds wasted! It is unjust.                     
  DON JUAN. No: you were fully and clearly warned. For your bad deeds,      
      vicarious atonement, mercy without justice. For your good deeds,      
      justice without mercy. We have many good people here.                 
  THE OLD WOMAN. Were you a good man?                                       
  DON JUAN. I was a murderer.                                               
  THE OLD WOMAN. A murderer! Oh, how dare they send me to herd with         
      murderers! I was not as bad as that: I was a good woman. There        
      is some mistake: where can I have it set right?                       
  DON JUAN. I do not know whether mistakes can be corrected here.           
      Probably they will not admit a mistake even if they have made         
      one.                                                                  
  THE OLD WOMAN. But whom can I ask?                                        
  DON JUAN. I should ask the Devil, Senora: he understands the ways of      
      this place, which is more than I ever could.                          
  THE OLD WOMAN. The Devil! *I* speak to the Devil!                         
  DON JUAN. In hell, Senora, the Devil is the leader of the best            
      society.                                                              
  THE OLD WOMAN. I tell you, wretch, I know I am not in hell.               
  DON JUAN. How do you know?                                                
  THE OLD WOMAN. Because I feel no pain.                                    
  DON JUAN. Oh, then there is no mistake: you are intentionally             
      damned.                                                               
  THE OLD WOMAN. Why do you say that?                                       
  DON JUAN. Because hell, Senora, is a place for the wicked. The            
      wicked are quite comfortable in it: it was made for them. You         
      tell me you feel no pain. I conclude you are one of those for         
      whom hell exists.                                                     
  THE OLD WOMAN. Do you feel no pain?                                       
  DON JUAN. I am not one of the wicked, Senora; therefore it bores me,      
      bores me beyond description, beyond belief.                           
  THE OLD WOMAN. Not one of the wicked! You said you were a murderer.       
  DON JUAN. Only a duel. I ran my sword through an old man who was          
      trying to run his through me.                                         
  THE OLD WOMAN. If you were a gentleman, that was not a murder.            
  DON JUAN. The old man called it murder, because he was, he said,          
      defending his daughter's honor. By this he meant that because I       
      foolishly fell in love with her and told her so, she screamed;        
      and he tried to assassinate me after calling me insulting names.      
  THE OLD WOMAN. You were like all men. Libertines and murderers all,       
      all, all!                                                             
  DON JUAN. And yet we meet here, dear lady.                                
  THE OLD WOMAN. Listen to me. My father was slain by just such a           
      wretch as you, in just such a duel, for just such a cause. I          
      screamed: it was my duty. My father drew on my assailant: his         
      honor demanded it. He fell: that was the reward of honor. I am        
      here: in hell, you tell me: that is the reward of duty. Is there      
      justice in heaven?                                                    
  DON JUAN. No; but there is justice in hell: heaven is far above such      
      idle human personalities. You will be welcome in hell, Senora.        
      Hell is the home of honor, duty, justice, and the rest of the         
      seven deadly virtues. All the wickedness on earth is done in          
      their name: where else but in hell should they have their             
      reward? Have I not told you that the truly damned are those who       
      are happy in hell?                                                    
  THE OLD WOMAN. And are you happy here?                                    
  DON JUAN [springing to his feet] No; and that is the enigma on which      
      I ponder in darkness. Why am I here? I, who repudiated all duty,      
      trampled honor underfoot, and laughed at justice!                     
  THE OLD WOMAN. Oh, what do I care why you are here? Why am *I* here?      
      I, who sacrificed all my inclinations to womanly virtue and           
      propriety!                                                            
  DON JUAN. Patience, lady: you will be perfectly happy and at home         
      here. As saith the poet, "Hell is a city much like Seville."          
  THE OLD WOMAN. Happy! here! where I am nothing! where I am nobody!        
  DON JUAN. Not at all: you are a lady; and wherever ladies are is          
      hell. Do not be surprised or terrified: you will find everything      
      here that a lady can desire, including devils who will serve you      
      from sheer love of servitude, and magnify your importance for         
      the sake of dignifying their service- the best of servants.           
  THE OLD WOMAN. My servants will be devils!                                
  DON JUAN. Have you ever had servants who were not devils?                 
  THE OLD WOMAN. Never: they were devils, perfect devils, all of them.      
      But that is only a manner of speaking. I thought you meant that       
      my servants here would be real devils.                                
  DON JUAN. No more real devils than you will be a real lady. Nothing       
      is real here. That is the horror of damnation.                        
  THE OLD WOMAN. Oh, this is all madness. This is worse than fire and       
      the worm.                                                             
  DON JUAN. For you, perhaps, there are consolations. For instance:         
      how old were you when you changed from time to eternity?              
  THE OLD WOMAN. Do not ask me how old I was- as if I were a thing of       
      the past. I am 77.                                                    
  DON JUAN. A ripe age, Senora. But in hell old age is not tolerated.       
      It is too real. Here we worship Love and Beauty. Our souls being      
      entirely damned, we cultivate our hearts. As a lady of 77, you        
      would not have a single acquaintance in hell.                         
  THE OLD WOMAN. How can I help my age, man?                                
  DON JUAN. You forget that you have left your age behind you in the        
      realm of time. You are no more 77 than you are 7 or 17 or 27.         
  THE OLD WOMAN. Nonsense!                                                  
  DON JUAN. Consider, Senora: was not this true even when you lived on      
      earth? When you were 70, were you really older underneath your        
      wrinkles and your grey hairs than when you were 30?                   
  THE OLD WOMAN. No, younger: at 30 I was a fool. But of what use is        
      it to feel younger and look older?                                    
  DON JUAN. You see, Senora, the look was only an illusion. Your            
      wrinkles lied, just as the plump smooth skin of many a stupid         
      girl of 17, with heavy spirits and decrepit ideas, lies about         
      her age. Well, here we have no bodies: we see each other as           
      bodies only because we learnt to think about one another under        
      that aspect when we were alive; and we still think in that way;       
      knowing no other. But we can appear to one another at what age        
      we choose. You have but to will any of your old looks back, and       
      back they will come.                                                  
  THE OLD WOMAN. It cannot be true.                                         
  DON JUAN. Try.                                                            
  THE OLD WOMAN. Seventeen!                                                 
  DON JUAN. Stop. Before you decide, I had better tell you that these       
      things are a matter of fashion. Occasionally we have a rage for       
      17; but it does not last long. Just at present the fashionable        
      age is 40- or say 37; but there are signs of a change. If you         
      were at all good-looking at 27, I should suggest your trying          
      that, and setting a new fashion.                                      
  THE OLD WOMAN. I do not believe a word you are saying. However, 27        
      be it. [Whisk! the old woman becomes a young one, magnificently       
      attired, and so handsome that in the radiance into which her          
      dull yellow halo has suddenly lightened one might almost mistake      
      her for Ann Whitefield].                                              
  DON JUAN. Dona Ana de Ulloa!                                              
  ANA. What? You know me!                                                   
  DON JUAN. And you forget me!                                              
  ANA. I cannot see your face. [He raises his hat]. Don Juan Tenorio!       
      Monster! You who slew my father! even here you pursue me.             
  DON JUAN. I protest I do not pursue you. Allow me to withdraw             
      [going].                                                              
  ANA [seizing his arm] You shall not leave me alone in this dreadful       
      place.                                                                
  DON JUAN. Provided my staying be not interpreted as pursuit.              
  ANA [releasing him] You may well wonder how I can endure your             
      presence. My dear, dear father!                                       
  DON JUAN. Would you like to see him?                                      
  ANA. My father here!!!                                                    
  DON JUAN. No: he is in heaven.                                            
  ANA. I knew it. My noble father! He is looking down on us now. What       
      must he feel to see his daughter in this place, and in                
      conversation with his murderer!                                       
  DON JUAN. By the way, if we should meet him-                              
  ANA. How can we meet him? He is in heaven.                                
  DON JUAN. He condescends to look in upon us here from time to time.       
      Heaven bores him. So let me warn you that if you meet him he          
      will be mortally offended if you speak of me as his murderer!         
      He maintains that he was a much better swordsman than I, and          
      that if his foot had not slipped he would have killed me. No          
      doubt he is right: I was not a good fencer. I never dispute the       
      point; so we are excellent friends.                                   
  ANA. It is no dishonor to a soldier to be proud of his skill in           
      arms.                                                                 
  DON JUAN. You would rather not meet him, probably.                        
  ANA. How dare you say that?                                               
  DON JUAN. Oh, that is the usual feeling here. You may remember that       
      on earth- though of course we never confessed it- the death of        
      anyone we knew, even those we liked best, was always mingled          
      with a certain satisfaction at being finally done with them.          
  ANA. Monster! Never, never.                                               
  DON JUAN [placidly] I see you recognize the feeling. Yes: a funeral       
      was always a festivity in black, especially the funeral of a          
      relative. At all events, family ties are rarely kept up here.         
      Your father is quite accustomed to this: he will not expect any       
      devotion from you.                                                    
  ANA. Wretch: I wore mourning for him all my life.                         
  DON JUAN. Yes: it became you. But a life of mourning is one thing:        
      an eternity of it quite another. Besides, here you are as dead        
      as he. Can anything be more ridiculous than one dead person           
      mourning for another? Do not look shocked, my dear Ana; and do        
      not be alarmed: there is plenty of humbug in hell (indeed there       
      is hardly anything else); but the humbug of death and age and         
      change is dropped because here we are all dead and all eternal.       
      You will pick up our ways soon.                                       
  ANA. And will all the men call me their dear Ana?                         
  DON JUAN. No. That was a slip of the tongue. I beg your pardon.           
  ANA [almost tenderly] Juan: did you really love me when you behaved       
      so disgracefully to me?                                               
  DON JUAN [impatiently] Oh, I beg you not to begin talking about           
      love. Here they talk of nothing else but love: its beauty, its        
      holiness, its spirituality, its devil knows what!- excuse me;         
      but it does so bore me. They dont know what theyre talking            
      about: I do. They think they have achieved the perfection of          
      love because they have no bodies. Sheer imaginative debauchery!       
      Faugh!                                                                
  ANA. Has even death failed to refine your soul, Juan? Has the             
      terrible judgment of which my father's statue was the minister        
      taught you no reverence?                                              
  DON JUAN. How is that very flattering statue, by the way? Does it         
      still come to supper with naughty people and cast them into this      
      bottomless pit?                                                       
  ANA. It has been a great expense to me. The boys in the monastery         
      school would not let it alone: the mischievous ones broke it;         
      and the studious ones wrote their names on it. Three new noses        
      in two years, and fingers without end. I had to leave it to its       
      fate at last; and now I fear it is shockingly mutilated. My poor      
      father!                                                               
  DON JUAN. Hush! Listen! [Two great chords rolling on syncopated           
      waves of sound break forth: D minor and its dominant: a sound of      
      dreadful joy to all musicians]. Ha! Mozart's statue music. It is      
      your father. You had better disappear until I prepare him. [She       
      vanishes].                                                            

    From the void comes a living statue of white marble, designed to        
represent a majestic old man. But he waives his majesty with                
infinite grace; walks with a feather-like step; and makes every             
wrinkle in his war worn visage brim over with holiday joyousness. To        
his sculptor he owes a perfectly trained figure, which he carries           
erect and trim; and the ends of his moustache curl up, elastic as           
watchsprings, giving him an air which, but for its Spanish dignity,         
would be called jaunty. He is on the pleasantest terms with Don             
Juan. His voice, save for a much more distinguished intonation, is          
so like the voice of Roebuck Ramsden that it calls attention to the         
fact that they are not unlike one another in spite of their very            
different fashions of shaving.                                              

  DON JUAN. Ah, here you are, my friend. Why dont you learn to sing         
      the splendid music Mozart has written for you?                        
  THE STATUE. Unluckily he has written it for a bass voice. Mine is a       
      counter tenor. Well: have you repented yet?                           
  DON JUAN. I have too much consideration for you to repent, Don            
      Gonzalo. If I did, you would have no excuse for coming from           
      Heaven to argue with me.                                              
  THE STATUE. True. Remain obdurate, my boy. I wish I had killed you,       
      as I should have done but for an accident. Then I should have         
      come here; and you would have had a statue and a reputation for       
      piety to live up to. Any news?                                        
  DON JUAN. Yes: your daughter is dead.                                     
  THE STATUE [puzzled] My daughter? [Recollecting] Oh! the one you          
      were taken with. Let me see: what was her name?                       
  DON JUAN. Ana.                                                            
  THE STATUE. To be sure: Ana. A good-looking girl, if I recollect          
      aright. Have you warned Whatshisname? her husband.                    
  DON JUAN. My friend Ottavio? No: I have not seen him since Ana            
      arrived.                                                              

    Ana comes indignantly to light.                                         

  ANA. What does this mean? Ottavio here and your friend! And you,          
      father, have forgotten my name. You are indeed turned to stone.       
  THE STATUE. My dear: I am so much more admired in marble than I ever      
      was in my own person that I have retained the shape the sculptor      
      gave me. He was one of the first men of his day: you must             
      acknowledge that.                                                     
  ANA. Father! Vanity! personal vanity! from you!                           
  THE STATUE. Ah, you outlived that weakness, my daughter: you must be      
      nearly eighty by this time. I was cut off (by an accident) in my      
      64th year, and am considerably your junior in consequence.            
      Besides, my child, in this place, what our libertine friend here      
      would call the farce of parental wisdom is dropped. Regard me, I      
      beg, as a fellow creature, not as a father.                           
  ANA. You speak as this villain speaks.                                    
  THE STATUE. Juan is a sound thinker, Ana. A bad fencer, but a sound       
      thinker.                                                              
  ANA [horror creeping upon her] I begin to understand. These are           
      devils, mocking me. I had better pray.                                
  THE STATUE [consoling her] No, no, no, my child: do not pray. If you      
      do, you will throw away the main advantage of this place.             
      Written over the gate here are the words "Leave every hope            
      behind, ye who enter." Only think what a relief that is! For          
      what is hope? A form of moral responsibility. Here there is no        
      hope, and consequently no duty, no work, nothing to be gained         
      by praying, nothing to be lost by doing what you like. Hell, in       
      short, is a place where you have nothing to do but amuse              
      yourself. [Don Juan sighs deeply]. You sigh, friend Juan; but         
      if you dwelt in heaven, as I do, you would realize your               
      advantages.                                                           
  DON JUAN. You are in good spirits today, Commander. You are               
      positively brilliant. What is the matter?                             
  THE STATUE. I have come to a momentous decision, my boy. But first,       
      where is our friend the Devil? I must consult him in the matter.      
      And Ana would like to make his acquaintance, no doubt.                
  ANA. You are preparing some torment for me.                               
  DON JUAN. All that is superstition, Ana. Reassure yourself.               
      Remember: the Devil is not so black as he is painted.                 
  THE STATUE. Let us give him a call.                                       

    At the wave of the statue's hand the great chords roll out              
again: but this time Mozart's music gets grotesquely adulterated            
with Gounod's. A scarlet halo begins to glow; and into it the Devil         
rises, very Mephistophelean, and not at all unlike Mendoza, though not      
so interesting. He looks older; is getting prematurely bald; and, in        
spite of an effusion of good nature and friendliness, is peevish and        
sensitive when his advances are not reciprocated. He does not               
inspire much confidence in his powers of hard work or endurance, and        
is, on the whole, a disagreeably self-indulgent looking person; but he      
is clever and plausible, though perceptibly less well bred than the         
two other men, and enormously less vital than the woman.                    

  THE DEVIL [heartily] Have I the pleasure of again receiving a visit       
      from the illustrious Commander of Calatrava? [Coldly] Don Juan,       
      your servant. [Politely] And a strange lady? My respects,             
      Senora.                                                               
  ANA. Are you-                                                             
  THE DEVIL [bowing] Lucifer, at your service.                              
  ANA. I shall go mad.                                                      
  THE DEVIL [gallantly] Ah, Senora, do not be anxious. You come to us       
      from earth, full of the prejudices and terrors of that                
      priest-ridden place. You have heard me ill spoken of; and yet,        
      believe me, I have hosts of friends there.                            
  ANA. Yes: you reign in their hearts.                                      
  THE DEVIL [shaking his head] You flatter me, Senora; but you are          
      mistaken. It is true that the world cannot get on without me;         
      but it never gives me credit for that: in its heart it mistrusts      
      and hates me. Its sympathies are all with misery, with poverty,       
      with starvation of the body and of the heart. I call on it to         
      sympathize with joy, with love, with happiness, with beauty-          
  DON JUAN [nauseated] Excuse me: I am going. You know I cannot stand       
      this.                                                                 
  THE DEVIL [angrily] Yes: I know that you are no friend of mine.           
  THE STATUE. What harm is he doing you, Juan? It seems to me that he       
      was talking excellent sense when you interrupted him.                 
  THE DEVIL [warmly patting the statue's hand] Thank you, my friend:        
      thank you. You have always understood me: he has always               
      disparaged and avoided me.                                            
  DON JUAN. I have treated you with perfect courtesy.                       
  THE DEVIL. Courtesy! What is courtesy? I care nothing for mere            
      courtesy. Give me warmth of heart, true sincerity, the bond of        
      sympathy with love and joy-                                           
  DON JUAN. You are making me ill.                                          
  THE DEVIL. There! [Appealing to the statue] You hear, sir! Oh, by         
      what irony of fate was this cold selfish egotist sent to my           
      kingdom, and you taken to the icy mansions of the sky!                
  THE STATUE. I cant complain. I was a hypocrite; and it served me          
      right to be sent to heaven.                                           
  THE DEVIL. Why, sir, do you not join us, and leave a sphere for           
      which your temperament is too sympathetic, your heart too warm,       
      your capacity for enjoyment too generous?                             
  THE STATUE. I have this day resolved to do so. In future, excellent       
      Son of the Morning, I am yours. I have left heaven for ever.          
  THE DEVIL [again touching the marble hand] Ah, what an honor! what a      
      triumph for our cause! Thank you, thank you. And now, my friend-      
      I may call you so at last- could you not persuade him to take         
      the place you have left vacant above?                                 
  THE STATUE [shaking his head] I cannot conscientiously recommend          
      anybody with whom I am on friendly terms to deliberately make         
      himself dull and uncomfortable.                                       
  THE DEVIL. Of course not; but are you sure he would be                    
      uncomfortable? Of course you know best: you brought him here          
      originally; and we had the greatest hopes of him. His sentiments      
      were in the best taste of our best people. You remember how he        
      sang? [He begins to sing in a nasal operatic baritone, tremulous      
      from an eternity of misuse in the French manner]                      

              Vivan le femmine!                                             
              Viva il buon vino!                                            

  THE STATUE [taking up the tune an octave higher in his counter            
      tenor]                                                                
              Sostegno e gloria                                             
              D'umanita.                                                    

  THE DEVIL. Precisely. Well, he never sings for us now.                    
  DON JUAN. Do you complain of that? Hell is full of musical amateurs:      
      music is the brandy of the damned. May not one lost soul be           
      permitted to abstain?                                                 
  THE DEVIL. You dare blaspheme against the sublimest of the arts!          
  DON JUAN [with cold disgust] You talk like a hysterical woman             
      fawning on a fiddler.                                                 
  THE DEVIL. I am not angry. I merely pity you. You have no soul; and       
      you are unconscious of all that you lose. Now you, Senor              
      Commander, are a born musician. How well you sing! Mozart would       
      be delighted if he were still here; but he moped and went to          
      heaven. Curious how these clever men, whom you would have             
      supposed born to be popular here, have turned out social              
      failures, like Don Juan!                                              
  DON JUAN. I am really very sorry to be a social failure.                  
  THE DEVIL. Not that we dont admire your intellect, you know. We do.       
      But I look at the matter from your own point of view. You dont        
      get on with us. The place doesnt suit you. The truth is, you          
      have- I wont say no heart; for we know that beneath all your          
      affected cynicism you have a warm one-                                
  DON JUAN [shrinking] Dont, please dont.                                   
  THE DEVIL [nettled] Well, youve no capacity for enjoyment. Will that      
      satisfy you?                                                          
  DON JUAN. It is a somewhat less insufferable form of cant than the        
      other. But if youll allow me, I'll take refuge, as usual, in          
      solitude.                                                             
  THE DEVIL. Why not take refuge in Heaven? Thats the proper place for      
      you. [To Ana] Come, Senora! could you not persuade him for his        
      own good to try change of air?                                        
  ANA. But can he go to heaven if he wants to?                              
  THE DEVIL. Whats to prevent him?                                          
  ANA. Can anybody- can *I* go to heaven if I want to?                      
  THE DEVIL [rather contemptuously] Certainly, if your taste lies that      
      way.                                                                  
  ANA. But why doesnt everybody go to heaven, then?                         
  THE STATUE [chuckling] I can tell you that, my dear. It's because         
      heaven is the most angelically dull place in all creation: thats      
      why.                                                                  
  THE DEVIL. His excellency the Commander puts it with military             
      bluntness; but the strain of living in heaven is intolerable.         
      There is a notion that I was turned out of it; but as a matter        
      of fact nothing could have induced me to stay there. I simply         
      left it and organized this place.                                     
  THE STATUE. I dont wonder at it. Nobody could stand an eternity of        
      heaven.                                                               
  THE DEVIL. Oh, it suits some people. Let us be just, Commander: it        
      is a question of temperament. I dont admire the heavenly              
      temperament: I dont understand it: I dont know that I                 
      particularly want to understand it; but it takes all sorts to         
      make a universe. There is no accounting for tastes: there are         
      people who like it. I think Don Juan would like it.                   
  DON JUAN. But- pardon my frankness- could you really go back there        
      if you desired to; or are the grapes sour?                            
  THE DEVIL. Back there! I often go back there. Have you never read         
      the book of Job? Have you any canonical authority for assuming        
      that there is any barrier between our circle and the other one?       
  ANA. But surely there is a great gulf fixed.                              
  THE DEVIL. Dear lady: a parable must not be taken literally. The          
      gulf is the difference between the angelic and the diabolic           
      temperament. What more impassable gulf could you have? Think of       
      what you have seen on earth. There is no physical gulf between        
      the philosopher's class room and the bull ring; but the bull          
      fighters do not come to the class room for all that. Have you         
      ever been in the country where I have the largest following?          
      England. There they have great racecourses, and also concert          
      rooms where they play the classical compositions of his               
      Excellency's friend Mozart. Those who go to the racecourses can       
      stay away from them and go to the classical concerts instead if       
      they like: there is no law against it; for Englishmen never will      
      be slaves: they are free to do whatever the Government and            
      public opinion allow them to do. And the classical concert is         
      admitted to be a higher, more cultivated, poetic, intellectual,       
      ennobling place than the racecourse. But do the lovers of racing      
      desert their sport and flock to the concert room? Not they. They      
      would suffer there all the weariness the Commander has suffered       
      in heaven. There is the great gulf of the parable between the         
      two places. A mere physical gulf they could bridge; or at least       
      I could bridge it for them (the earth is full of Devil's              
      Bridges); but the gulf of dislike is impassable and eternal.          
      And that is the only gulf that separates my friends here from         
      those who are invidiously called the blest.                           
  ANA. I shall go to heaven at once.                                        
  THE STATUE. My child: one word of warning first. Let me complete my       
      friend Lucifer's similitude of the classical concert. At every        
      one of these concerts in England you will find rows of weary          
      people who are there, not because they really like classical          
      music, but because they think they ought to like it. Well, there      
      is the same thing in heaven. A number of people sit there in          
      glory, not because they are happy, but because they think they        
      owe it to their position to be in heaven. They are almost all         
      English.                                                              
  THE DEVIL. Yes: the Southerners give it up and join me just as you        
      have done. But the English really do not seem to know when they       
      are thoroughly miserable. An Englishman thinks he is moral when       
      he is only uncomfortable.                                             
  THE STATUE. In short, my daughter, if you go to heaven without being      
      naturally qualified for it, you will not enjoy yourself there.        
  ANA. And who dares say that I am not naturally qualified for it? The      
      most distinguished princes of the Church have never questioned        
      it. I owe it to myself to leave this place at once.                   
  THE DEVIL [offended] As you please, Senora. I should have expected        
      better taste from you.                                                
  ANA. Father: I shall expect you to come with me. You cannot stay          
      here. What will people say?                                           
  THE STATUE. People! Why, the best people are here- princes of the         
      church and all. So few go to heaven, and so many come here, that      
      the blest, once called a heavenly host, are a continually             
      dwindling minority. The saints, the fathers, the elect of long        
      ago are the cranks, the faddists, the outsiders of today.             
  THE DEVIL. It is true. From the beginning of my career I knew that        
      I should win in the long run by sheer weight of public opinion,       
      in spite of the long campaign of misrepresentation and calumny        
      against me. At bottom the universe is a constitutional one; and       
      with such a majority as mine I cannot be kept permanently out of      
      office.                                                               
  DON JUAN. I think, Ana, you had better stay here.                         
  ANA [jealously] You do not want me to go with you.                        
  DON JUAN. Surely you do not want to enter heaven in the company of a      
      reprobate like me.                                                    
  ANA. All souls are equally precious. You repent, do you not?              
  DON JUAN. My dear Ana, you are silly. Do you suppose heaven is like       
      earth, where people persuade themselves that what is done can be      
      undone by repentance; that what is spoken can be unspoken by          
      withdrawing it; that what is true can be annihilated by a             
      general agreement to give it the lie? No: heaven is the home of       
      the masters of reality: that is why I am going thither.               
  ANA. Thank you: I am going to heaven for happiness. I have had quite      
      enough of reality on earth.                                           
  DON JUAN. Then you must stay here; for hell is the home of the            
      unreal and of the seekers for happiness. It is the only refuge        
      from heaven, which is, as I tell you, the home of the masters of      
      reality, and from earth, which is the home of the slaves of           
      reality. The earth is a nursery in which men and women play at        
      being heroes and heroines, saints and sinners; but they are           
      dragged down from their fool's paradise by their bodies: hunger       
      and cold and thirst, age and decay and disease, death above all,      
      make them slaves of reality: thrice a day meals must be eaten         
      and digested: thrice a century a new generation must be               
      engendered: ages of faith, of romance, and of science are all         
      driven at last to have but one prayer, "Make me a healthy             
      animal." But here you escape this tyranny of the flesh; for here      
      you are not an animal at all: you are a ghost, an appearance,         
      an illusion, a convention, deathless, ageless: in a word,             
      bodiless. There are no social questions here, no political            
      questions, no religious questions, best of all, perhaps, no           
      sanitary questions. Here you call your appearance beauty, your        
      emotions love, your sentiments heroism, your aspirations virtue,      
      just as you did on earth; but here there are no hard facts to         
      contradict you, no ironic contrast of your needs with your            
      pretensions, no human comedy, nothing but a perpetual romance,        
      a universal melodrama. As our German friend put it in his poem,       
      "the poetically nonsensical here is good sense; and the Eternal       
      Feminine draws us ever upward and on"- without getting us a step      
      farther. And yet you want to leave this paradise!                     
  ANA. But if hell be so beautiful as this, how glorious must heaven        
      be!                                                                   

    The Devil, the Statue, and Don Juan all begin to speak at once          
in violent protest; then stop, abashed.                                     

  DON JUAN. I beg your pardon.                                              
  THE DEVIL. Not at all. I interrupted you.                                 
  THE STATUE. You were going to say something.                              
  DON JUAN. After you, gentlemen.                                           
  THE DEVIL [to Don Juan] You have been so eloquent on the advantages       
      of my dominions that I leave you to do equal justice to the           
      drawbacks of the alternative establishment.                           
  DON JUAN. In heaven, as I picture it, dear lady, you live and work        
      instead of playing and pretending. You face things as they are;       
      you escape nothing but glamor; and your steadfastness and your        
      peril are your glory. If the play still goes on here and on           
      earth, and all the world is a stage, Heaven is at least behind        
      the scenes. But Heaven cannot be described by metaphor. Thither       
      I shall go presently, because there I hope to escape at last          
      from lies and from the tedious, vulgar pursuit of happiness, to       
      spend my eons in contemplation-                                       
  THE STATUE. Ugh!                                                          
  DON JUAN. Senor Commander: I do not blame your disgust: a picture         
      gallery is a dull place for a blind man. But even as you enjoy        
      the contemplation of such romantic mirages as beauty and              
      pleasure; so would I enjoy the contemplation of that which            
      interests me above all things: namely, Life: the force that ever      
      strives to attain greater power of contemplating itself. What         
      made this brain of mine, do you think? Not the need to move my        
      limbs; for a rat with half my brains moves as well as I. Not          
      merely the need to do, but the need to know what I do, lest in        
      my blind efforts to live I should be slaying myself.                  
  THE STATUE. You would have slain yourself in your blind efforts to        
      fence but for my foot slipping, my friend.                            
  DON JUAN. Audacious ribald: your laughter will finish in hideous          
      boredom before morning.                                               
  THE STATUE. Ha ha! Do you remember how I frightened you when I said       
      something like that to you from my pedestal in Seville? It            
      sounds rather flat without my trombones.                              
  DON JUAN. They tell me it generally sounds flat with them,                
      Commander.                                                            
  ANA. Oh, do not interrupt with these frivolities, father. Is there        
      nothing in Heaven but contemplation, Juan?                            
  DON JUAN. In the Heaven I seek, no other joy. But there is the work       
      of helping Life in its struggle upward. Think of how it wastes        
      and scatters itself, how it raises up obstacles to itself and         
      destroys itself in its ignorance and blindness. It needs a            
      brain, this irresistible force, lest in its ignorance it should       
      resist itself. What a piece of work is man! says the poet. Yes;       
      but what a blunderer! Here is the highest miracle of                  
      organization yet attained by life, the most intensely alive           
      thing that exists, the most conscious of all the organisms; and       
      yet, how wretched are his brains! Stupidity made sordid and           
      cruel by the realities learnt from toll and poverty: Imagination      
      resolved to starve sooner than face these realities, piling up        
      illusions to hide them, and calling itself cleverness, genius!        
      And each accusing the other of its own defect: Stupidity              
      accusing Imagination of folly, and Imagination accusing               
      Stupidity of ignorance: whereas, alas! Stupidity has all the          
      knowledge, and Imagination all the intelligence.                      
  THE DEVIL. And a pretty kettle of fish they make of it between them.      
      Did I not say, when I was arranging that affair of Faust's, that      
      all Man's reason has done for him is to make him beastlier than       
      any beast. One splendid body is worth the brains of a hundred         
      dyspeptic, flatulent philosophers.                                    
  DON JUAN. You forget that brainless magnificence of body has been         
      tried. Things immeasurably greater than man in every respect but      
      brain have existed and perished. The megatherium, the                 
      icthyosaurus have paced the earth with seven-league steps and         
      hidden the day with cloud vast wings. Where are they now?             
      Fossils in museums, and so few and imperfect at that, that a          
      knuckle bone or a tooth of one of them is prized beyond the           
      lives of a thousand soldiers. These things lived and wanted to        
      live; but for lack of brains they did not know how to carry out       
      their purpose, and so destroyed themselves.                           
  THE DEVIL. And is Man any the less destroying himself for all this        
      boasted brain of his? Have you walked up and down upon the earth      
      lately? I have; and I have examined Man's wonderful inventions.       
      And I tell you that in the arts of life man invents nothing; but      
      in the arts of death he outdoes Nature herself, and produces by       
      chemistry and machinery all the slaughter of plague, pestilence,      
      and famine. The peasant I tempt today eats and drinks what was        
      eaten and drunk by the peasants of ten thousand years ago; and        
      the house he lives in has not altered as much in a thousand           
      centuries as the fashion of a lady's bonnet in a score of weeks.      
      But when he goes out to slay, he carries a marvel of mechanism        
      that lets loose at the touch of his finger all the hidden             
      molecular energies, and leaves the javelin, the arrow, the            
      blowpipe of his fathers far behind. In the arts of peace Man is       
      a bungler. I have seen his cotton factories and the like, with        
      machinery that a greedy dog could have invented if it had wanted      
      money instead of food. I know his clumsy typewriters and              
      bungling locomotives and tedious bicycles: they are toys              
      compared to the Maxim gun, the submarine torpedo boat. There is       
      nothing in Man's industrial machinery but his greed and sloth:        
      his heart is in his weapons. This marvellous force of Life of         
      which you boast is a force of Death: Man measures his strength        
      by his destructiveness. What is his religion? An excuse for           
      hating me. What is his law? An excuse for hanging you. What is        
      his morality? Gentility! An excuse for consuming without              
      producing. What is his art? An excuse for gloating over pictures      
      of slaughter. What are his politics? Either the worship of a          
      despot because a despot can kill, or parliamentary cockfighting.      
      I spent an evening lately in a certain celebrated legislature,        
      and heard the pot lecturing the kettle for its blackness, and         
      ministers answering questions. When I left I chalked up on the        
      door the old nursery saying "Ask no questions and you will be         
      told no lies." I bought a sixpenny family magazine, and found         
      it full of pictures of young men shooting and stabbing one            
      another. I saw a man die: he was a London bricklayer's laborer        
      with seven children. He left seventeen pounds club money; and         
      his wife spent it all on his funeral and went into the workhouse      
      with the children next day. She would not have spent sevenpence       
      on her children's schooling: the law had to force her to let          
      them be taught gratuitously; but on death she spent all she had.      
      Their imagination glows, their energies rise up at the idea of        
      death, these people: they love it; and the more horrible it is        
      the more they enjoy it. Hell is a place far above their               
      comprehension: they derive their notion of it from two of the         
      greatest fools that ever lived, an Italian and an Englishman.         
      The Italian described it as a place of mud, frost, filth, fire,       
      and venomous serpents: all torture. This ass, when he was not         
      lying about me, was maundering about some woman whom he saw once      
      in the street. The Englishman described me as being expelled          
      from Heaven by cannons and gunpowder; and to this day every           
      Briton believes that the whole of his silly story is in the           
      Bible. What else he says I do not know; for it is all in a long       
      poem which neither I nor anyone else ever succeeded in wading         
      through. It is the same in everything. The highest form of            
      literature is the tragedy, a play in which everybody is murdered      
      at the end. In the old chronicles you read of earthquakes and         
      pestilences, and are told that these shewed the power and             
      majesty of God and the littleness of Man. Nowadays the                
      chronicles describe battles. In a battle two bodies of men shoot      
      at one another with bullets and explosive shells until one body       
      runs away, when the others chase the fugitives on horseback and       
      cut them to pieces as they fly. And this, the chronicle               
      concludes, shews the greatness and majesty of empires, and the        
      littleness of the vanquished. Over such battles the people run        
      about the streets yelling with delight, and egg their Government      
      on to spend hundreds of millions of money in the slaughter,           
      whilst the strongest Ministers dare not spend an extra penny in       
      the pound against the poverty and pestilence through which they       
      themselves daily walk. I could give you a thousand instances;         
      but they all come to the same thing: the power that governs the       
      earth is not the power of Life but of Death; and the inner need       
      that has nerved Life to the effort of organising itself into the      
      human being is not the need for higher life but for a more            
      efficient engine of destruction. The plague, the famine, the          
      earthquake, the tempest were too spasmodic in their action; the       
      tiger and crocodile were too easily satiated and not cruel            
      enough: something more constantly, more ruthlessly, more              
      ingeniously destructive was needed; and that something was Man,       
      the inventor of the rack, the stake, the gallows, the electric        
      chair; of sword and gun and poison gas: above all, of justice,        
      duty, patriotism, and all the other isms by which even those who      
      are clever enough to be humanely disposed are persuaded to            
      become the most destructive of all the destroyers.                    
  DON JUAN. Pshaw! all this is old. Your weak side, my diabolic             
      friend, is that you have always been a gull: you take Man at his      
      own valuation. Nothing would flatter him more than your opinion       
      of him. He loves to think of himself as bold and bad. He is           
      neither one nor the other: he is only a coward. Call him tyrant,      
      murderer, pirate, bully; and he will adore you, and swagger           
      about with the consciousness of having the blood of the old sea       
      kings in his veins. Call him liar and thief; and he will only         
      take an action against you for libel. But call him coward; and        
      he will go mad with rage: he will face death to outface that          
      stinging truth. Man gives every reason for his conduct save one,      
      every excuse for his crimes save one, every plea for his safety       
      save one; and that one is his cowardice. Yet all his                  
      civilization is founded on his cowardice, on his abject               
      tameness, which he calls his respectability. There are limits         
      to what a mule or an ass will stand; but Man will suffer himself      
      to be degraded until his vileness becomes so loathsome to his         
      oppressors that they themselves are forced to reform it.              
  THE DEVIL. Precisely. And these are the creatures in whom you             
      discover what you call a Life Force!                                  
  DON JUAN. Yes; for now comes the most surprising part of the whole        
      business.                                                             
  THE STATUE. Whats that?                                                   
  DON JUAN. Why, that you can make any of these cowards brave by            
      simply putting an idea into his head.                                 
  THE STATUE. Stuff! As an old soldier I admit the cowardice: it's as       
      universal as sea sickness, and matters just as little. But that       
      about putting an idea into a man's head is stuff and nonsense.        
      In a battle all you need to make you fight is a little hot blood      
      and the knowledge that it's more dangerous to lose than to win.       
  DON JUAN. That is perhaps why battles are so useless. But men never       
      really overcome fear until they imagine they are fighting to          
      further a universal purpose- fighting for an idea, as they call       
      it. Why was the Crusader braver than the pirate? Because he           
      fought, not for himself, but for the Cross. What force was it         
      that met him with a valor as reckless as his own? The force of        
      men who fought, not for themselves, but for Islam. They took          
      Spain from us though we were fighting for our very hearths and        
      homes; but when we, too, fought for that mighty idea, a Catholic      
      Church, we swept them back to Africa.                                 
  THE DEVIL [ironically] What! you a Catholic, Senor Don Juan! A            
      devotee! My congratulations.                                          
  THE STATUE [seriously] Come, come! as a soldier, I can listen to          
      nothing against the Church.                                           
  DON JUAN. Have no fear, Commander: this idea of a Catholic Church         
      will survive Islam, will survive the Cross, will survive even         
      that vulgar pageant of incompetent schoolboyish gladiators            
      which you call the Army.                                              
  THE STATUE. Juan: you will force me to call you to account for this.      
  DON JUAN. Useless: I cannot fence. Every idea for which Man will die      
      will be a Catholic idea. When the Spaniard learns at last that        
      he is no better than the Saracen, and his prophet no better than      
      Mahomet, he will arise, more Catholic than ever, and die on a         
      barricade across the filthy slum he starves in, for universal         
      liberty and equality.                                                 
  THE STATUE. Bosh!                                                         
  DON JUAN. What you call bosh is the only thing men dare die for.          
      Later on, Liberty will not be Catholic enough: men will die for       
      human perfection, to which they will sacrifice all their liberty      
      gladly.                                                               
  THE DEVIL. Ay: they will never be at a loss for an excuse for             
      killing one another.                                                  
  DON JUAN. What of that? It is not death that matters, but the fear        
      of death. It is not killing and dying that degrades us, but base      
      living, and accepting the wages and profits of degradation.           
      Better ten dead men than one live slave or his master. Men shall      
      yet rise up, father against son and brother against brother, and      
      kill one another for the great Catholic idea of abolishing            
      slavery.                                                              
  THE DEVIL. Yes, when the Liberty and Equality of which you prate          
      shall have made free white Christians cheaper in the labor            
      market than black heathen slaves sold by auction at the block.        
  DON JUAN. Never fear! the white laborer shall have his turn too. But      
      I am not now defending the illusory forms the great ideas take.       
      I am giving you examples of the fact that this creature Man, who      
      in his own selfish affairs is a coward to the backbone, will          
      fight for an idea like a hero. He may be abject as a citizen;         
      but he is dangerous as a fanatic. He can only be enslaved whilst      
      he is spiritually weak enough to listen to reason. I tell you,        
      gentlemen, if you can shew a man a piece of what he now calls         
      God's work to do, and what he will later on call by many new          
      names, you can make him entirely reckless of the consequences to      
      himself personally.                                                   
  ANA. Yes: he shirks all his responsibilities, and leaves his wife to      
      grapple with them.                                                    
  THE STATUE. Well said, Daughter. Do not let him talk you out of your      
      common sense.                                                         
  THE DEVIL. Alas! Senor Commander, now that we have got on to the          
      subject of Woman, he will talk more than ever. However, I             
      confess it is for me the one supremely interesting subject.           
  DON JUAN. To a woman, Senora, man's duties and responsibilities           
      begin and end with the task of getting bread for her children.        
      To her, Man is only a means to the end of getting children and        
      rearing them.                                                         
  ANA. Is that your idea of a woman's mind? I call it cynical and           
      disgusting animalism.                                                 
  DON JUAN. Pardon me, Ana: I said nothing about a woman's whole mind.      
      I spoke of her view of Man as a separate sex. It is no more           
      cynical than her view of herself as above all things a Mother.        
      Sexually, Woman is Nature's contrivance for perpetuating its          
      highest achievement. Sexually, Man is Woman's contrivance for         
      fulfilling Nature's behest in the most economical way. She knows      
      by instinct that far back in the evolutional process she              
      invented him, differentiated him, created him in order to             
      produce something better than the single-sexed process can            
      produce. Whilst he fulfils the purpose for which she made him,        
      he is welcome to his dreams, his follies, his ideals, his             
      heroisms, provided that the keystone of them all is the worship       
      of woman, of motherhood, of the family, of the hearth. But how        
      rash and dangerous it was to invent a separate creature whose         
      sole function was her own impregnation! For mark what has             
      happened. First, Man has multiplied on her hands until there are      
      as many men as women; so that she has been unable to employ for       
      her purposes more than a fraction of the immense energy she has       
      left at his disposal by saving him the exhausting labor of            
      gestation. This superfluous energy has gone to his brain and to       
      his muscle. He has become too strong to be controlled by her          
      bodily, and too imaginative and mentally vigorous to be content       
      with mere self-reproduction. He has created civilization without      
      consulting her, taking her domestic labor for granted as the          
      foundation of it.                                                     
  ANA. That is true, at all events.                                         
  THE DEVIL. Yes; and this civilization! what is it, after all?             
  DON JUAN. After all, an excellent peg to hang your cynical                
      commonplaces on; but before all, it is an attempt on Man's part       
      to make himself something more than the mere instrument of            
      Woman's purpose. So far, the result of Life's continual effort        
      not only to maintain itself, but to achieve higher and higher         
      organization and completer self-consciousness, is only, at best,      
      a doubtful campaign between its forces and those of Death and         
      Degeneration. The battles in this campaign are mere blunders,         
      mostly won, like actual military battles, in spite of the             
      commanders.                                                           
  THE STATUE. That is a dig at me. No matter: go on, go on.                 
  DON JUAN. It is a dig at a much higher power than you, Commander.         
      Still, you must have noticed in your profession that even a           
      stupid general can win battles when the enemy's general is a          
      little stupider.                                                      
  THE STATUE [very seriously] Most true, Juan, most true. Some donkeys      
      have amazing luck.                                                    
  DON JUAN. Well, the Life Force is stupid; but it is not so stupid as      
      the forces of Death and Degeneration. Besides, these are in its       
      pay all the time. And so Life wins, after a fashion. What mere        
      copiousness of fecundity can supply and mere greed preserve, we       
      possess. The survival of whatever form of civilization can            
      produce the best rifle and the best fed riflemen is assured.          
  THE DEVIL. Exactly! the survival, not of the most effective means of      
      Life but of the most effective means of Death. You always come        
      back to my point, in spite of your wrigglings and evasions and        
      sophistries, not to mention the intolerable length of your            
      speeches.                                                             
  DON JUAN. Oh, come! who began making long speeches? However, if I         
      overtax your intellect, you can leave us and seek the society of      
      love and beauty and the rest of your favorite boredoms.               
  THE DEVIL [much offended] This is not fair, Don Juan, and not civil.      
      I am also on the intellectual plane. Nobody can appreciate it         
      more than I do. I am arguing fairly with you, and, I think,           
      successfully refuting you. Let us go on for another hour if you       
      like.                                                                 
  DON JUAN. Good: let us.                                                   
  THE STATUE. Not that I see any prospect of your coming to any point       
      in particular, Juan. Still, since in this place, instead of           
      merely killing time we have to kill eternity, go ahead by all         
      means.                                                                
  DON JUAN [somewhat impatiently] My point, you marble-headed old           
      masterpiece, is only a step ahead of you. Are we agreed that          
      Life is a force which has made innumerable experiments in             
      organizing itself; that the mammoth and the man, the mouse and        
      the megatherium, the flies and the fleas and the Fathers of the       
      Church, are all more or less successful attempts to build up          
      that raw force into higher and higher individuals, the ideal          
      individual being omnipotent, omniscient, infallible, and withal       
      completely, unilludedly self-conscious: in short, a god?              
  THE DEVIL. I agree, for the sake of argument.                             
  THE STATUE. I agree, for the sake of avoiding argument.                   
  ANA. I most emphatically disagree as regards the Fathers of the           
      Church; and I must beg you not to drag them into the argument.        
  DON JUAN. I did so purely for the sake of alliteration, Ana; and I        
      shall make no further allusion to them. And now, since we are,        
      with that exception, agreed so far, will you not agree with me        
      further that Life has not measured the success of its attempts        
      at godhead by the beauty or bodily perfection of the result,          
      since in both these respects the birds, as our friend                 
      Aristophanes long ago pointed out, are so extraordinarily             
      superior, with their power of flight and their lovely plumage,        
      and, may I add, the touching poetry of their loves and nestings,      
      that it is inconceivable that Life, having once produced them,        
      should, if love and beauty were her object, start off on another      
      line and labor at the clumsy elephant and the hideous ape, whose      
      grandchildren we are?                                                 
  ANA. Aristophanes was a heathen; and you, Juan, I am afraid, are          
      very little better.                                                   
  THE DEVIL. You conclude, then, that Life was driving at clumsiness        
      and ugliness?                                                         
  DON JUAN. No, perverse devil that you are, a thousand times no. Life      
      was driving at brains- at its darling object: an organ by which       
      it can attain not only self-consciousness but                         
      self-understanding.                                                   
  THE STATUE. This is metaphysics, Juan. Why the devil should- [to the      
      Devil] I beg your pardon.                                             
  THE DEVIL. Pray dont mention it. I have always regarded the use of        
      my name to secure additional emphasis as a high compliment to         
      me. It is quite at your service, Commander.                           
  THE STATUE. Thank you: thats very good of you. Even in heaven, I          
      never quite got out of my old military habits of speech. What I       
      was going to ask Juan was why Life should bother itself about         
      getting a brain. Why should it want to understand itself? Why         
      not be content to enjoy itself?                                       
  DON JUAN. Without a brain, Commander, you would enjoy yourself            
      without knowing it, and so lose all the fun.                          
  THE STATUE. True, most true. But I am quite content with brain            
      enough to know that I'm enjoying myself. I dont want to               
      understand why. In fact, I'd rather not. My experience is that        
      one's pleasures dont bear thinking about.                             
  DON JUAN. That is why intellect is so unpopular. But to Life, the         
      force behind the Man, intellect is a necessity, because without       
      it he blunders into death. Just as Life, after ages of struggle,      
      evolved that wonderful bodily organ the eye, so that the living       
      organism could see where it was going and what was coming to          
      help or threaten it, and thus avoid a thousand dangers that           
      formerly slew it, so it is evolving today a mind's eye that           
      shall see, not the physical world, but the purpose of Life, and       
      thereby enable the individual to work for that purpose instead        
      of thwarting and baffling it by setting up shortsighted personal      
      aims as at present. Even as it is, only one sort of man has ever      
      been happy, has ever been universally respected among all the         
      conflicts of interests and illusions.                                 
  THE STATUE. You mean the military man.                                    
  DON JUAN. Commander: I do not mean the military man. When the             
      military man approaches, the world locks up its spoons and packs      
      off its womankind. No: I sing, not arms and the hero, but the         
      philosophic man: he who seeks in contemplation to discover the        
      inner will of the world, in invention to discover the means of        
      fulfilling that will, and in action to do that will by the            
      so-discovered means. Of all other sorts of men I declare myself       
      tired. They are tedious failures. When I was on earth,                
      professors of all sorts prowled round me feeling for an               
      unhealthy spot in me on which they could fasten. The doctors of       
      medicine bade me consider what I must do to save my body, and         
      offered me quack cures for imaginary diseases. I replied that I       
      was not a hypochondriac; so they called me Ignoramus and went         
      their way. The doctors of divinity bade me consider what I must       
      do to save my soul; but I was not a spiritual hypochondriac any       
      more than a bodily one, and would not trouble myself about that       
      either; so they called me Atheist and went their way. After them      
      came the politician, who said there was only one purpose in           
      nature, and that was to get him into parliament. I told him I         
      did not care whether he got into parliament or not; so he called      
      me Mugwump and went his way. Then came the romantic man, the          
      Artist, with his love songs and his paintings and his poems; and      
      with him I had great delight for many years, and some profit;         
      for I cultivated my senses for his sake; and his songs taught         
      me to hear better, his paintings to see better, and his poems to      
      feel more deeply. But he led me at last into the worship of           
      Woman.                                                                
  ANA. Juan!                                                                
  DON JUAN. Yes: I came to believe that in her voice was all the music      
      of the song, in her face all the beauty of the painting, and in       
      her soul all the emotion of the poem.                                 
  ANA. And you were disappointed, I suppose. Well, was it her fault         
      that you attributed all these perfections to her?                     
  DON JUAN. Yes, partly. For with a wonderful instinctive cunning, she      
      kept silent and allowed me to glorify her: to mistake my own          
      visions, thoughts, and feelings for hers. Now my friend the           
      romantic man was often too poor or too timid to approach those        
      women who were beautiful or refined enough to seem to realize         
      his ideal; and so he went to his grave believing in his dream.        
      But I was more favored by nature and circumstance. I was of           
      noble birth and rich; and when my person did not please, my           
      conversation flattered, though I generally found myself               
      fortunate in both.                                                    
  THE STATUE. Coxcomb!                                                      
  DON JUAN. Yes; but even my coxcombry pleased. Well, I found that          
      when I had touched a woman's imagination, she would allow me to       
      persuade myself that she loved me; but when my suit was granted       
      she never said "I am happy: my love is satisfied": she always         
      said, first, "At last, the barriers are down," and second, "When      
      will you come again?"                                                 
  ANA. That is exactly what men say.                                        
  DON JUAN. I protest I never said it. But all women say it. Well,          
      these two speeches always alarmed me; for the first meant that        
      the lady's impulse had been solely to throw down my                   
      fortifications and gain my citadel; and the second openly             
      announced that henceforth she regarded me as her property, and        
      counted my time as already wholly at her disposal.                    
  THE DEVIL. That is where your want of heart came in.                      
  THE STATUE [shaking his head] You shouldnt repeat what a woman says,      
      Juan.                                                                 
  ANA [severely] It should be sacred to you.                                
  THE STATUE. Still, they certainly do say it. I never minded the           
      barriers; but there was always a slight shock about the other,        
      unless one was very hard hit indeed.                                  
  DON JUAN. Then the lady, who had been happy and idle enough before,       
      became anxious, preoccupied with me, always intriguing,               
      conspiring, pursuing, watching, waiting, bent wholly on making        
      sure of her prey: I being the prey, you understand. Now this was      
      not what I had bargained for. It may have been very proper and        
      very natural; but it was not music, painting, poetry, and joy         
      incarnated in a beautiful woman. I ran away from it. I ran away       
      from it very often: in fact I became famous for running away          
      from it.                                                              
  ANA. Infamous, you mean.                                                  
  DON JUAN. I did not run away from you. Do you blame me for running        
      away from the others?                                                 
  ANA. Nonsense, man. You are talking to a woman of 77 now. If you had      
      had the chance, you would have run away from me too- if I had         
      let you. You would not have found it so easy with me as with          
      some of the others. If men will not be faithful to their home         
      and their duties, they must be made to be. I daresay you all          
      want to marry lovely incarnations of music and painting and           
      poetry. Well, you cant have them, because they dont exist. If         
      flesh and blood is not good enough for you you must go without:       
      thats all. Women have to put up with flesh-and-blood husbands-        
      and little enough of that too, sometimes; and you will have to        
      put up with flesh-and-blood wives. [The Devil looks dubious.          
      The Statue makes a wry face]. I see you dont like that, any of        
      you; but it's true, for all that; so if you dont like it you          
      can lump it.                                                          
  DON JUAN. My dear lady, you have put my whole case against romance        
      into a few sentences. That is just why I turned my back on the        
      romantic man with the artist nature, as he called his                 
      infatuation. I thanked him for teaching me to use my eyes and         
      ears; but I told him that his beauty worshipping and happiness        
      hunting and woman idealizing was not worth a dump as a                
      philosophy of life; so he called me Philistine and went his way.      
  ANA. It seems that Woman taught you something, too, with all her          
      defects.                                                              
  DON JUAN. She did more: she interpreted all the other teaching for        
      me. Ah, my friends, when the barriers were down for the first         
      time, what an astounding illumination! I had been prepared for        
      infatuation, for intoxication, for all the illusions of love's        
      young dream; and lo! never was my perception clearer, nor my          
      criticism more ruthless. The most jealous rival of my mistress        
      never saw every blemish in her more keenly than I. I was not          
      duped: I took her without chloroform.                                 
  ANA. But you did take her.                                                
  DON JUAN. That was the revelation. Up to that moment I had never          
      lost the sense of being my own master; never consciously taken        
      a single step until my reason had examined and approved it. I         
      had come to believe that I was a purely rational creature: a          
      thinker! I said, with the foolish philosopher, "I think;              
      therefore I am." It was Woman who taught me to say "I am;             
      therefore I think." And also "I would think more; therefore I         
      must be more."                                                        
  THE STATUE. This is extremely abstract and metaphysical, Juan. If         
      you would stick to the concrete, and put your discoveries in the      
      form of entertaining anecdotes about your adventures with women,      
      your conversation would be easier to follow.                          
  DON JUAN. Bah! what need I add? Do you not understand that when I         
      stood face to face with Woman, every fibre in my clear critical       
      brain warned me to spare her and save myself. My morals said No.      
      My conscience said No. My chivalry and pity for her said No. My       
      prudent regard for myself said No. My ear, practised on a             
      thousand songs and symphonies; my eye, exercised on a thousand        
      paintings; tore her voice, her features, her color to shreds. I       
      caught all those tell-tale resemblances to her father and mother      
      by which I knew what she would be like in thirty years' time. I       
      noted the gleam of gold from a dead tooth in the laughing mouth:      
      I made curious observations of the strange odors of the               
      chemistry of the nerves. The visions of my romantic reveries,         
      in which I had trod the plains of heaven with a deathless,            
      ageless creature of coral and ivory, deserted me in that supreme      
      hour. I remembered them and desperately strove to recover their       
      illusion; but they now seemed the emptiest of inventions: my          
      judgment was not to be corrupted: my brain still said No on           
      every issue. And whilst I was in the act of framing my excuse to      
      the lady, Life seized me and threw me into her arms as a sailor       
      throws a scrap of fish into the mouth of a seabird.                   
  THE STATUE. You might as well have gone without thinking such a lot       
      about it, Juan. You are like all the clever men; you have more        
      brains than is good for you.                                          
  THE DEVIL. And were you not the happier for the experience, Senor         
      Don Juan?                                                             
  DON JUAN. The happier, no: the wiser, yes. That moment introduced me      
      for the first time to myself, and, through myself, to the world.      
      I saw then how useless it is to attempt to impose conditions on       
      the irresistible force of Life; to preach prudence, careful           
      selection, virtue, honor, chastity-                                   
  ANA. Don Juan: a word against chastity is an insult to me.                
  DON JUAN. I say nothing against your chastity, Senora, since it took      
      the form of a husband and twelve children. What more could you        
      have done had you been the most abandoned of women?                   
  ANA. I could have had twelve husbands and no children: thats what I       
      could have done, Juan. And let me tell you that that would have       
      made all the difference to the earth which I replenished.             
  THE STATUE. Bravo Ana! Juan: you are floored, quelled, annihilated.       
  DON JUAN. No: for though that difference is the true essential            
      difference- Dona Ana has, I admit, gone straight to the real          
      point- yet it is not a difference of love or chastity, or even        
      constancy; for twelve children by twelve different husbands           
      would have replenished the earth perhaps more effectively.            
      Suppose my friend Ottavio had died when you were thirty, you          
      would never have remained a widow: you were too beautiful.            
      Suppose the successor of Ottavio had died when you were forty,        
      you would still have been irresistible; and a woman who marries       
      twice marries three times if she becomes free to do so. Twelve        
      lawful children borne by one highly respectable lady to three         
      different fathers is not impossible nor condemned by public           
      opinion. That such a lady may be more law abiding than the poor       
      girl whom we used to spurn into the gutter for bearing one            
      unlawful infant is no doubt true; but dare you say she is less        
      self-indulgent?                                                       
  ANA. She is more virtuous: that is enough for me.                         
  DON JUAN. In that case, what is virtue but the Trade Unionism of the      
      married? Let us face the facts, dear Ana. The Life Force              
      respects marriage only because marriage is a contrivance of its       
      own to secure the greatest number of children and the closest         
      care of them. For honor, chastity, and all the rest of your           
      moral figments it cares not a rap. Marriage is the most               
      licentious of human institutions-                                     
  ANA. Juan!                                                                
  THE STATUE [protesting] Really!-                                          
  DON JUAN [determinedly] I say the most licentious of human                
      institutions: that is the secret of its popularity. And a woman       
      seeking a husband is the most unscrupulous of all the beasts of       
      prey. The confusion of marriage with morality has done more to        
      destroy the conscience of the human race than any other single        
      error. Come, Ana! do not look shocked: you know better than any       
      of us that marriage is a mantrap baited with simulated                
      accomplishments and delusive idealizations. When your sainted         
      mother, by dint of scoldings and punishments, forced you to           
      learn how to play half a dozen pieces on the spinet- which she        
      hated as much as you did- had she any other purpose than to           
      delude your suitors into the belief that your husband would have      
      in his home an angel who would fill it with melody, or at least       
      play him to sleep after dinner? You married my friend Ottavio:        
      well, did you ever open the spinet from the hour when the Church      
      united him to you?                                                    
  ANA. You are a fool, Juan. A young married woman has something else       
      to do than sit at the spinet without any support for her back;        
      so she gets out of the habit of playing.                              
  DON JUAN. Not if she loves music. No: believe me, she only throws         
      away the bait when the bird is in the net.                            
  ANA [bitterly] And men, I suppose, never throw off the mask when          
      their bird is in the net. The husband never becomes negligent,        
      selfish, brutal- oh, never!                                           
  DON JUAN. What do these recriminations prove, Ana? Only that the          
      hero is as gross an imposture as the heroine.                         
  ANA. It is all nonsense: most marriages are perfectly comfortable.        
  DON JUAN. "Perfectly" is a strong expression, Ana. What you mean is       
      that sensible people make the best of one another. Send me to         
      the galleys and chain me to the felon whose number happens to         
      be next before mine; and I must accept the inevitable and make        
      the best of the companionship. Many such companionships, they         
      tell me, are touchingly affectionate; and most are at least           
      tolerably friendly. But that does not make a chain a desirable        
      ornament nor the galleys an abode of bliss. Those who talk most       
      about the blessings of marriage and the constancy of its vows         
      are the very people who declare that if the chain were broken         
      and the prisoners left free to choose, the whole social fabric        
      would fly asunder. You cannot have the argument both ways. If         
      the prisoner is happy, why lock him in? If he is not, why             
      pretend that he is?                                                   
  ANA. At all events, let me take an old woman's privilege again, and       
      tell you flatly that marriage peoples the world and debauchery        
      does not.                                                             
  DON JUAN. How if a time come when this shall cease to be true? Do         
      you not know that where there is a will there is a way? that          
      whatever Man really wishes to do he will finally discover a           
      means of doing? Well, you have done your best, you virtuous           
      ladies, and others of your way of thinking, to bend Man's mind        
      wholly towards honorable love as the highest good, and to             
      understand by honorable love, romance and beauty and happiness        
      in the possession of beautiful, refined, delicate, affectionate       
      women. You have taught women to value their own youth, health,        
      shapeliness, and refinement above all things. Well, what place        
      have squalling babies and household cares in this exquisite           
      paradise of the senses and emotions? Is it not the inevitable         
      end of it all that the human will shall say to the human brain:       
      Invent me a means by which I can have love, beauty, romance,          
      emotion, passion, without their wretched penalties, their             
      expenses, their worries, their trials, their illnesses and            
      agonies and risks of death, their retinue of servants and nurses      
      and doctors and schoolmasters.                                        
  THE DEVIL. All this, Senor Don Juan, is realized here in my realm.        
  DON JUAN. Yes, at the cost of death. Man will not take it at that         
      price: he demands the romantic delights of your hell whilst he        
      is still on earth. Well, the means will be found: the brain will      
      not fail when the will is in earnest. The day is coming when          
      great nations will find their numbers dwindling from census to        
      census; when the six roomed villa will rise in price above the        
      family mansion; when the viciously reckless poor and the              
      stupidly pious rich will delay the extinction of the race only        
      by degrading it; whilst the boldly prudent, the thriftily             
      selfish and ambitious, the imaginative and poetic, the lovers         
      of money and solid comfort, the worshippers of success, of art,       
      and of love, will all oppose to the Force of Life the device of       
      sterility.                                                            
  THE STATUE. That is all very eloquent, my young friend; but if you        
      had lived to Ana's age, or even to mine, you would have learned       
      that the people who get rid of the fear of poverty and children       
      and all the other family troubles, and devote themselves to           
      having a good time of it, only leave their minds free for the         
      fear of old age and ugliness and impotence and death. The             
      childless laborer is more tormented by his wife's idleness and        
      her constant demands for amusement and distraction than he could      
      be by twenty children; and his wife is more wretched than he. I       
      have had my share of vanity; for as a young man I was admired         
      by women; and as a statue I am praised by art critics. But I          
      confess that had I found nothing to do in the world but wallow        
      in these delights I should have cut my throat. When I married         
      Ana's mother- or perhaps, to be strictly correct, I should            
      rather say when I at last gave in and allowed Ana's mother to         
      marry me- I knew that I was planting thorns in my pillow, and         
      that marriage for me, a swaggering young officer thitherto            
      unvanquished, meant defeat and capture.                               
  ANA [scandalized] Father!                                                 
  THE STATUE. I am sorry to shock you, my love; but since Juan has          
      stripped every rag of decency from the discussion I may as well       
      tell the frozen truth.                                                
  ANA. Hmf! I suppose I was one of the thorns.                              
  THE STATUE. By no means: you were often a rose. You see, your mother      
      had most of the trouble you gave.                                     
  DON JUAN. Then may I ask, Commander, why you have left Heaven to          
      come here and wallow, as you express it, in sentimental               
      beatitudes which you confess would once have driven you to cut        
      your throat?                                                          
  THE STATUE [struck by this] Egad, thats true.                             
  THE DEVIL [alarmed] What! You are going back from your word! [To Don      
      Juan] And all your philosophizing has been nothing but a mask         
      for proselytizing! [To the Statue] Have you forgotten already         
      the hideous dulness from which I am offering you a refuge here?       
      [To Don Juan] And does your demonstration of the approaching          
      sterilization and extinction of mankind lead to anything better       
      than making the most of those pleasures of art and love which         
      you yourself admit refined you, elevated you, developed you?          
  DON JUAN. I never demonstrated the extinction of mankind. Life            
      cannot will its own extinction either in its blind amorphous          
      state or in any of the forms into which it has organized itself.      
      I had not finished when His Excellency interrupted me.                
  THE STATUE. I begin to doubt whether you ever will finish, my             
      friend. You are extremely fond of hearing yourself talk.              
  DON JUAN. True; but since you have endured so much, you may as well       
      endure to the end. Long before this sterilization which I             
      described becomes more than a clearly foreseen possibility, the       
      reaction will begin. The great central purpose of breeding the        
      race: ay, breeding it to heights now deemed superhuman: that          
      purpose which is now hidden in a mephitic cloud of love and           
      romance and prudery and fastidiousness, will break through into       
      clear sunlight as a purpose no longer to be confused with the         
      gratification of personal fancies, the impossible realization         
      of boys' and girls' dreams of bliss, or the need of older people      
      for companionship or money. The plain-spoken marriage services        
      of the vernacular Churches will no longer be abbreviated and          
      half suppressed as indelicate. The sober decency, earnestness,        
      and authority of their declaration of the real purpose of             
      marriage will be honored and accepted, whilst their romantic          
      vowings and pledgings and until-death-do-us-partings and the          
      like will be expunged as unbearable frivolities. Do my sex the        
      justice to admit, Senora, that we have always recognized that         
      the sex relation is not a personal or friendly relation at all.       
  ANA. Not a personal or friendly relation! What relation is more           
      personal? more sacred? more holy?                                     
  DON JUAN. Sacred and holy, if you like, Ana, but not personally           
      friendly. Your relation to God is sacred and holy: dare you call      
      it personally friendly? In the sex relation the universal             
      creative energy, of which the parties are both the helpless           
      agents, over-rides and sweeps away all personal considerations,       
      and dispenses with all personal relations. The pair may be utter      
      strangers to one another, speaking different languages,               
      differing in race and color, in age and disposition, with no          
      bond between them but a possibility of that fecundity for the         
      sake of which the Life Force throws them into one another's arms      
      at the exchange of a glance. Do we not recognize this by              
      allowing marriages to be made by parents without consulting the       
      woman? Have you not often expressed your disgust at the               
      immorality of the English nation, in which women and men of           
      noble birth become acquainted and court each other like               
      peasants? And how much does even the peasant know of his bride        
      or she of him before he engages himself? Why, you would not make      
      a man your lawyer or your family doctor on so slight an               
      acquaintance as you would fall in love with and marry him!            
  ANA. Yes, Juan: we know the libertine's philosophy. Always ignore         
      the consequences to the woman.                                        
  DON JUAN. The consequences, yes: they justify her fierce grip of the      
      man. But surely you do not call that attachment a sentimental         
      one. As well call the policeman's attachment to his prisoner a        
      love relation.                                                        
  ANA. You see you have to confess that marriage is necessary, though,      
      according to you, love is the slightest of all human relations.       
  DON JUAN. How do you know that it is not the greatest of all human        
      relations? far too great to be a personal matter. Could your          
      father have served his country if he had refused to kill any          
      enemy of Spain unless he personally hated him? Can a woman serve      
      her country if she refuses to marry any man she does not              
      personally love? You know it is not so: the woman of noble birth      
      marries as the man of noble birth fights, on political and            
      family grounds, not on personal ones.                                 
  THE STATUE [impressed] A very clever point that, Juan: I must think       
      it over. You are really full of ideas. How did you come to think      
      of this one?                                                          
  DON JUAN. I learnt it by experience. When I was on earth, and made        
      those proposals to ladies which, though universally condemned,        
      have made me so interesting a hero of legend, I was not               
      infrequently met in some such way as this. The lady would say         
      that she would countenance my advances, provided they were            
      honorable. On inquiring what that proviso meant, I found that         
      it meant that I proposed to get possession of her property if         
      she had any, or to undertake her support for life if she had          
      not; that I desired her continual companionship, counsel, and         
      conversation to the end of my days, and would take a most solemn      
      oath to be always enraptured by them above all, that I would          
      turn my back on all other women for ever for her sake. I did not      
      object to these conditions because they were exorbitant and           
      inhuman: it was their extraordinary irrelevance that prostrated       
      me. I invariably replied with perfect frankness that I had never      
      dreamt of any of these things; that unless the lady's character       
      and intellect were equal or superior to my own, her conversation      
      must degrade and her counsel mislead me; that her constant            
      companionship might, for all I knew, become intolerably tedious       
      to me; that I could not answer for my feelings for a week in          
      advance, much less to the end of my life; that to cut me off          
      from all natural and unconstrained intercourse with half my           
      fellowcreatures would narrow and warp me if I submitted to it,        
      and, if not, would bring me under the curse of clandestinity;         
      that, finally, my proposals to her were wholly unconnected with       
      any of these matters, and were the outcome of a perfectly simple      
      impulse of my manhood towards her womanhood.                          
  ANA. You mean that it was an immoral impulse.                             
  DON JUAN. Nature, my dear lady, is what you call immoral. I blush         
      for it; but I cannot help it. Nature is a pandar, Time a              
      wrecker, and Death a murderer. I have always preferred to stand       
      up to those facts and build institutions on their recognition.        
      You prefer to propitiate the three devils by proclaiming their        
      chastity, their thrift, and their loving kindness; and to base        
      your institutions on these flatteries. Is it any wonder that the      
      institutions do not work smoothly?                                    
  THE STATUE. What used the ladies to say, Juan?                            
  DON JUAN. Oh, come! Confidence for confidence. First tell me what         
      you used to say to the ladies.                                        
  THE STATUE. I! Oh, I swore that I would be faithful to the death;         
      that I should die if they refused me; that no woman could ever        
      be to me what she was-                                                
  ANA. She! Who?                                                            
  THE STATUE. Whoever it happened to be at the time, my dear. I had         
      certain things I always said. One of them was that even when I        
      was eighty, one white hair of the woman I loved would make me         
      tremble more than the thickest gold tress from the most               
      beautiful young head. Another was that I could not bear the           
      thought of anyone else being the mother of my children.               
  DON JUAN [revolted] You old rascal!                                       
  THE STATUE [stoutly] Not a bit; for I really believed it with all my      
      soul at the moment. I had a heart: not like you. And it was this      
      sincerity that made me successful.                                    
  DON JUAN. Sincerity! To be fool enough to believe a ramping,              
      stamping, thumping lie: that is what you call sincerity! To be        
      so greedy for a woman that you deceive yourself in your               
      eagerness to deceive her: sincerity, you call it!                     
  THE STATUE. Oh damn your sophistries! I was a man in love, not a          
      lawyer. And the women loved me for it, bless them!                    
  DON JUAN. They made you think so. What will you say when I tell you       
      that though I played the lawyer so callously, they made me think      
      so too? I also had my moments of infatuation in which I gushed        
      nonsense and believed it. Sometimes the desire to give pleasure       
      by saying beautiful things so rose in me on the flood of emotion      
      that I said them recklessly. At other times I argued against          
      myself with a devilish coldness that drew tears. But I found it       
      just as hard to escape when I was cruel as when I was kind. When      
      the lady's instinct was set on me, there was nothing for it but       
      lifelong servitude or flight.                                         
  ANA. You dare boast, before me and my father, that every woman found      
      you irresistible.                                                     
  DON JUAN. Am I boasting? It seems to me that I cut the most pitiable      
      of figures. Besides, I said "when the lady's instinct was set on      
      me." It was not always so; and then, heavens! what transports of      
      virtuous indignation! what overwhelming defiance to the               
      dastardly seducer! what scenes of Imogen and Iachimo!                 
  ANA. I made no scenes. I simply called my father.                         
  DON JUAN. And he came, sword in hand, to vindicate outraged honor         
      and morality by murdering me.                                         
  THE STATUE. Murdering! What do you mean? Did I kill you or did you        
      kill me?                                                              
  DON JUAN. Which of us was the better fencer?                              
  THE STATUE. I was.                                                        
  DON JUAN. Of course you were. And yet you, the hero of those              
      scandalous adventures you have just been relating to us, you had      
      the effrontery to pose as the avenger of outraged morality and        
      condemn me to death! You would have slain me but for an               
      accident.                                                             
  THE STATUE. I was expected to, Juan. That is how things were              
      arranged on earth. I was not a social reformer; and I always did      
      what it was customary for a gentleman to do.                          
  DON JUAN. That may account for your attacking me, but not for the         
      revolting hypocrisy of your subsequent proceedings as a statue.       
  THE STATUE. That all came of my going to heaven.                          
  THE DEVIL. I still fail to see, Senor Don Juan, that these episodes       
      in your earthly career and in that of the Senor Commander in any      
      way discredit my view of life. Here, I repeat, you have all that      
      you sought without anything that you shrank from.                     
  DON JUAN. On the contrary, here I have everything that disappointed       
      me without anything that I have not already tried and found           
      wanting. I tell you that as long as I can conceive something          
      better than myself I cannot be easy unless I am striving to           
      bring it into existence or clearing the way for it. That is the       
      law of my life. That is the working within me of Life's               
      incessant aspiration to higher organization, wider, deeper,           
      intenser self-consciousness, and clearer self-understanding. It       
      was the supremacy of this purpose that reduced love for me to         
      the mere pleasure of a moment, art for me to the mere schooling       
      of my faculties, religion for me to a mere excuse for laziness,       
      since it had set up a God who looked at the world and saw it was      
      good, against the instinct in me that looked through my eyes at       
      the world and saw that it could be improved. I tell you that in       
      the pursuit of my own pleasure, my own health, my own fortune,        
      I have never known happiness. It was not love for Woman that          
      delivered me into her hands: it was fatigue, exhaustion. When I       
      was a child, and bruised my head against a stone, I ran to the        
      nearest woman and cried away my pain against her apron. When I        
      grew up, and bruised my soul against the brutalities and              
      stupidities with which I had to strive, I did again just what I       
      had done as a child. I have enjoyed, too, my rests, my                
      recuperations, my breathing times, my very prostrations after         
      strife; but rather would I be dragged through all the circles         
      of the foolish Italian's Inferno than through the pleasures of        
      Europe. That is what has made this place of eternal pleasures         
      so deadly to me. It is the absence of this instinct in you that       
      makes you that strange monster called a Devil. It is the success      
      with which you have diverted the attention of men from their          
      real purpose, which in one degree or another is the same as           
      mine, to yours, that has earned you the name of The Tempter. It       
      is the fact that they are doing your will, or rather drifting         
      with your want of will, instead of doing their own, that makes        
      them the uncomfortable, false, restless, artificial, petulant,        
      wretched creatures they are.                                          
  THE DEVIL [mortified] Senor Don Juan: you are uncivil to my friends.      
  DON JUAN. Pooh! why should I be civil to them or to you? In this          
      Palace of Lies a truth or two will not hurt you. Your friends         
      are all the dullest dogs I know. They are not beautiful: they         
      are only decorated. They are not clean: they are only shaved and      
      starched. They are not dignified: they are only fashionably           
      dressed. They are not educated: they are only college passmen.        
      They are not religious: they are only pewrenters. They are not        
      moral: they are only conventional. They are not virtuous: they        
      are only cowardly. They are not even vicious: they are only           
      "frail." They are not artistic: they are only lascivious. They        
      are not prosperous: they are only rich. They are not loyal, they      
      are only servile; not dutiful, only sheepish; not public              
      spirited, only patriotic; not courageous, only quarrelsome; not       
      determined, only obstinate; not masterful, only domineering; not      
      self-controlled, only obtuse; not self-respecting, only vain;         
      not kind, only sentimental; not social, only gregarious; not          
      considerate, only polite; not intelligent, only opinionated; not      
      progressive, only factious; not imaginative, only superstitious;      
      not just, only vindictive; not generous, only propitiatory; not       
      disciplined, only cowed; and not truthful at all: liars every         
      one of them, to the very backbone of their souls.                     
  THE STATUE. Your flow of words is simply amazing, Juan. How I wish        
      I could have talked like that to my soldiers.                         
  THE DEVIL. It is mere talk, though. It has all been said before; but      
      what change has it ever made? What notice has the world ever          
      taken of it?                                                          
  DON JUAN. Yes, it is mere talk. But why is it mere talk? Because, my      
      friend, beauty, purity, respectability, religion, morality, art,      
      patriotism, bravery, and the rest are nothing but words which I       
      or anyone else can turn inside out like a glove. Were they            
      realities, you would have to plead guilty to my indictment; but       
      fortunately for your self-respect, my diabolical friend, they         
      are not realities. As you say, they are mere words, useful for        
      duping barbarians into adopting civilization, or the civilized        
      poor into submitting to be robbed and enslaved. That is the           
      family secret of the governing caste; and if we who are of that       
      caste aimed at more Life for the world instead of at more power       
      and luxury for our miserable selves, that secret would make us        
      great. Now, since I, being a nobleman, am in the secret too,          
      think how tedious to me must be your unending cant about all          
      these moralistic figments, and how squalidly disastrous your          
      sacrifice of your lives to them! If you even believed in your         
      moral game enough to play it fairly, it would be interesting to       
      watch; but you dont: you cheat at every trick; and if your            
      opponent outcheats you, you upset the table and try to murder         
      him.                                                                  
  THE DEVIL. On earth there may be some truth in this, because the          
      people are uneducated and cannot appreciate my religion of love       
      and beauty; but here-                                                 
  DON JUAN. Oh yes: I know. Here there is nothing but love and beauty.      
      Ugh! it is like sitting for all eternity at the first act of a        
      fashionable play, before the complications begin. Never in my         
      worst moments of superstitious terror on earth did I dream that       
      hell was so horrible. I live, like a hair-dresser, in the             
      continual contemplation of beauty, toying with silken tresses.        
      I breathe an atmosphere of sweetness, like a confectioner's           
      shopboy. Commander: are there any beautiful women in Heaven?          
  THE STATUE. None. Absolutely none. All dowdies. Not two pennorth of       
      jewellery among a dozen of them. They might be men of fifty.          
  DON JUAN. I am impatient to get there. Is the word beauty ever            
      mentioned; and are there any artistic people?                         
  THE STATUE. I give you my word they wont admire a fine statue even        
      when it walks past them.                                              
  DON JUAN. I go.                                                           
  THE DEVIL. Don Juan: shall I be frank with you?                           
  DON JUAN. Were you not so before?                                         
  THE DEVIL. As far as I went, yes. But I will now go further, and          
      confess to you that men get tired of everything, of heaven no         
      less than of hell; and that all history is nothing but a record       
      of the oscillations of the world between these two extremes. An       
      epoch is but a swing of the pendulum; and each generation thinks      
      the world is progressing because it is always moving. But when        
      you are as old as I am; when you have a thousand times wearied        
      of heaven, like myself and the Commander, and a thousand times        
      wearied of hell, as you are wearied now, you will no longer           
      imagine that every swing from heaven to hell is an emancipation,      
      every swing from hell to heaven an evolution. Where you now see       
      reform, progress, fulfilment of upward tendency, continual            
      ascent by Man on the stepping stones of his dead selves to            
      higher things, you will see nothing but an infinite comedy of         
      illusion. You will discover the profound truth of the saying of       
      my friend Koheleth, that there is nothing new under the sun.          
      Vanitas vanitatum-                                                    
  DON JUAN [out of all patience] By Heaven, this is worse than your         
      cant about love and beauty. Clever dolt that you are, is a man        
      no better than a worm, or a dog than a wolf, because he gets          
      tired of everything? Shall he give up eating because he destroys      
      his appetite in the act of gratifying it? Is a field idle when        
      it is fallow? Can the Commander expend his hellish energy here        
      without accumulating heavenly energy for his next term of             
      blessedness? Granted that the great Life Force has hit on the         
      device of the clockmaker's pendulum, and uses the earth for its       
      bob; that the history of each oscillation, which seems so novel       
      to us the actors, is but the history of the last oscillation          
      repeated; nay more, that in the unthinkable infinitude of time        
      the sun throws off the earth and catches it again a thousand          
      times as a circus rider throws up a ball, and that our agelong        
      epochs are but the moments between the toss and the catch, has        
      the colossal mechanism no purpose?                                    
  THE DEVIL. None, my friend. You think, because you have a purpose,        
      Nature must have one. You might as well expect it to have             
      fingers and toes because you have them.                               
  DON JUAN. But I should not have them if they served no purpose. And       
      I, my friend am as much a part of Nature as my own finger is a        
      part of me. If my finger is the organ by which I grasp the sword      
      and the mandoline, my brain is the organ by which Nature strives      
      to understand itself. My dog's brain serves only my dog's             
      purposes; but my own brain labors at a knowledge which does           
      nothing for me personally but make my body bitter to me and my        
      decay and death a calamity. Were I not possessed with a purpose       
      beyond my own I had better be a ploughman than a philosopher;         
      for the ploughman lives as long as the philosopher, eats more,        
      sleeps better, and rejoices in the wife of his bosom with less        
      misgiving. This is because the philosopher is in the grip of the      
      Life Force. This Life Force says to him "I have done a thousand       
      wonderful things unconsciously by merely willing to live and          
      following the line of least resistance: now I want to know            
      myself and my destination, and choose my path; so I have made a       
      special brain- a philosopher's brain- to grasp this knowledge         
      for me as the husbandman's hand grasps the plough for me. And         
      this" says the Life Force to the philosopher "must thou strive        
      to do for me until thou diest, when I will make another brain         
      and another philosopher to carry on the work."                        
  THE DEVIL. What is the use of knowing?                                    
  DON JUAN. Why, to be able to choose the line of greatest advantage        
      instead of yielding in the direction of the least resistance.         
      Does a ship sail to its destination no better than a log drifts       
      nowhither? The philosopher is Nature's pilot. And there you have      
      our difference: to be in hell is to drift: to be in heaven is to      
      steer.                                                                
  THE DEVIL. On the rocks, most likely.                                     
  DON JUAN. Pooh! which ship goes oftenest on the rocks or to the           
      bottom? the drifting ship or the ship with a pilot on board?          
  THE DEVIL. Well, well, go your way, Senor Don Juan. I prefer to be        
      my own master and not the tool of any blundering universal            
      force. I know that beauty is good to look at; that music is good      
      to hear; that love is good to feel; and that they are all good        
      to think about and talk about. I know that to be well exercised       
      in these sensations, emotions, and studies is to be a refined         
      and cultivated being. Whatever they may say of me in churches on      
      earth, I know that it is universally admitted in good society         
      that the Prince of Darkness is a gentleman; and that is enough        
      for me. As to your Life Force, which you think irresistible, it       
      is the most resistible thing in the world for a person of any         
      character. But if you are naturally vulgar and credulous, as          
      all reformers are, it will thrust you first into religion, where      
      you will sprinkle water on babies to save their souls from me;        
      then it will drive you from religion into science, where you          
      will snatch the babies from the water sprinkling and inoculate        
      them with disease to save them from catching it accidentally;         
      then you will take to politics, where you will become the             
      catspaw of corrupt functionaries and the henchman of ambitious        
      humbugs; and the end will be despair and decrepitude, broken          
      nerve and shattered hopes, vain regrets for that worst and            
      silliest of wastes and sacrifices, the waste and sacrifice of         
      the power of enjoyment: in a word, the punishment of the fool         
      who pursues the better before he has secured the good.                
  DON JUAN. But at least I shall not be bored. The service of the Life      
      Force has that advantage, at all events. So fare you well, Senor      
      Satan.                                                                
  THE DEVIL [amiably] Fare you well, Don Juan. I shall often think of       
      our interesting chats about things in general. I wish you every       
      happiness: Heaven, as I said before, suits some people. But if        
      you should change your mind, do not forget that the gates are         
      always open here to the repentant prodigal. If you feel at any        
      time that warmth of heart, sincere unforced affection, innocent       
      enjoyment, and warm, breathing, palpitating reality-                  
  DON JUAN. Why not say flesh and blood at once, though we have left        
      those two greasy commonplaces behind us?                              
  THE DEVIL [angrily] You throw my friendly farewell back in my teeth,      
      then, Don Juan?                                                       
  DON JUAN. By no means. But though there is much to be learnt from a       
      cynical devil, I really cannot stand a sentimental one. Senor         
      Commander: you know the way to the frontier of hell and heaven.       
      Be good enough to direct me.                                          
  THE STATUE. Oh, the frontier is only the difference between two ways      
      of looking at things. Any road will take you across it if you         
      really want to get there.                                             
  DON JUAN. Good. [Saluting Dona Ana] Senora: your servant.                 
  ANA. But I am going with you.                                             
  DON JUAN. I can find my own way to heaven, Ana; not yours [he             
      vanishes].                                                            
  ANA. How annoying!                                                        
  THE STATUE [calling after him] Bon voyage, Juan! [He wafts a final        
      blast of his great rolling chords after him as a parting salute.      
      A faint echo of the first ghostly melody comes back in                
      acknowledgment]. Ah! there he goes. [Puffing a long breath out        
      through his lips] Whew! How he does talk! Theyll never stand it       
      in heaven.                                                            
  THE DEVIL [gloomily] His going is a political defeat. I cannot keep       
      these Life Worshippers: they all go. This is the greatest loss        
      I have had since that Dutch painter went: a fellow who would          
      paint a hag of 70 with as much enjoyment as a Venus of 20.            
  THE STATUE. I remember: he came to heaven. Rembrandt.                     
  THE DEVIL. Ay, Rembrandt. There is something unnatural about these        
      fellows. Do not listen to their gospel, Senor Commander: it is        
      dangerous. Beware of the pursuit of the Superhuman: it leads to       
      an indiscriminate contempt for the Human. To a man, horses and        
      dogs and cats are mere species, outside the moral world. Well,        
      to the Superman, men and women are a mere species too, also           
      outside the moral world. This Don Juan was kind to women and          
      courteous to men as your daughter here was kind to her pet cats       
      and dogs; but such kindness is a denial of the exclusively human      
      character of the soul.                                                
  THE STATUE. And who the deuce is the Superman?                            
  THE DEVIL. Oh, the latest fashion among the Life Force fanatics. Did      
      you not meet in Heaven, among the new arrivals, that German           
      Polish madman? what was his name? Nietzsche?                          
  THE STATUE. Never heard of him.                                           
  THE DEVIL. Well, he came here first, before he recovered his wits.        
      I had some hopes of him; but he was a confirmed Life Force            
      worshipper. It was he who raked up the Superman, who is as old        
      as Prometheus; and the 20th century will run after this newest        
      of the old crazes when it gets tired of the world, the flesh,         
      and your humble servant.                                              
  THE STATUE. Superman is a good cry; and a good cry is half the            
      battle. I should like to see this Nietzsche.                          
  THE DEVIL. Unfortunately he met Wagner here, and had a quarrel with       
      him.                                                                  
  THE STATUE. Quite right, too. Mozart for me!                              
  THE DEVIL. Oh, it was not about music. Wagner once drifted into Life      
      Force worship, and invented a Superman called Siegfried. But he       
      came to his senses afterwards. So when they met here, Nietzsche       
      denounced him as a renegade; and Wagner wrote a pamphlet to           
      prove that Nietzsche was a Jew; and it ended in Nietzsche's           
      going to heaven in a huff. And a good riddance too. And now, my       
      friend, let us hasten to my palace and celebrate your arrival         
      with a grand musical service.                                         
  THE STATUE. With pleasure: youre most kind.                               
  THE DEVIL. This way, Commander. We go down the old trap [he places        
      himself on the grave trap].                                           
  THE STATUE. Good. [Reflectively] All the same, the Superman is a          
      fine conception. There is something statuesque about it. [He          
      places himself on the grave trap beside the Devil. It begins to       
      descend slowly. Red glow from the abysss]. Ah, this reminds me        
      of old times.                                                         
  THE DEVIL. And me also.                                                   
  ANA. Stop! [The trap stops].                                              
  THE DEVIL. You, Senora, cannot come this way. You will have an            
      apotheosis. But you will be at the palace before us.                  
  ANA. That is not what I stopped you for. Tell me: where can I find        
      the Superman?                                                         
  THE DEVIL. He is not yet created, Senora.                                 
  THE STATUE. And never will be, probably. Let us proceed: the red          
      fire will make me sneeze. [They descend].                             
  ANA. Not yet created! Then my work is not yet done. [Crossing             
      herself devoutly] I believe in the Life to Come. [Crying to the       
      universe] A father! a father for the Superman!                        

    She vanishes into the void; and again there is nothing; all             
existence seems suspended infinitely. Then, vaguely, there is a live        
human voice crying somewhere. One sees, with a shock, a mountain            
peak shewing faintly against a lighter background. The sky has              
returned from afar; and we suddenly remember where we were. The cry         
becomes distinct and urgent: it says *Automobile, Automobile.* The          
complete reality comes back with a rush: in a moment it is full             
morning in the Sierra; and the brigands are scrambling to their feet        
and making for the road as the goatherd runs down from the hill,            
warning them of the approach of another motor. Tanner and Mendoza rise      
amazedly and stare at one another with scattered wits. Straker sits up      
to yawn for a moment before he gets on his feet, making it a point          
of honor not to shew any undue interest in the excitement of the            
bandits. Mendoza gives a quick look to see that his followers are           
attending to the alarm; then exchanges a private word with Tanner.          

  MENDOZA. Did you dream?                                                   
  TANNER. Damnably. Did you?                                                
  MENDOZA. Yes. I forget what. You were in it.                              
  TANNER. So were you. Amazing!                                             
  MENDOZA. I warned you. [A shot is heard from the road]. Dolts! they       
      will play with that gun. [The brigands come running back              
      scared]. Who fired that shot? [to Duval] was it you?                  
  DUVAL [breathless] I have not shoot. Dey shoot first.                     
  ANARCHIST. I told you to begin by abolishing the State. Now we are        
      all lost.                                                             
  THE ROWDY SOCIAL-DEMOCRAT [stampeding across the amphitheatre] Ran,       
      everybody.                                                            
  MENDOZA [collaring him; throwing him on his back; and drawing a           
      knife] I stab the man who stirs. [He blocks the way. The              
      stampede is checked]. What has happened?                              
  THE SULKY SOCIAL-DEMOCRAT. A motor-                                       
  THE ANARCHIST. Three men-                                                 
  DUVAL. Deux femmes-                                                       
  MENDOZA. Three men and two women! Why have you not brought them           
      here? Are you afraid of them?                                         
  THE ROWDY ONE [getting up] Thyve a hescort. Ow, de-ooh luts ook it,       
      Mendowza.                                                             
  THE SULKY ONE. Two armored cars full o soldiers at the ed o the           
      valley.                                                               
  ANARCHIST. The shot was fired in the air. It was a signal.                

    Straker whistles his favorite air, which falls on the ears of           
the brigands like a funeral march.                                          

  TANNER. It is not an escort, but an expedition to capture you. We         
      were advised to wait for it; but I was in a hurry.                    
  THE ROWDY ONE [in agony of apprehension] And Ow my good Lord, ere we      
      are, wytin for em! Luts tike to the mahntns.                          
  MENDOZA. Idiot, what do you know about the mountains? Are you a           
      Spaniard? You would be given up by the first shepherd you met.        
      Besides, we are already within range of their rifles.                 
  THE ROWDY ONE. Bat-                                                       
  MENDOZA. Silence. Leave this to me. [To Tanner] Comrade: you will         
      not betray us.                                                        
  STRAKER. Oo are you callin comrade?                                       
  MENDOZA. Last night the advantage was with me. The robber of the          
      poor was at the mercy of the robber of the rich. You offered          
      your hand: I took it.                                                 
  TANNER. I bring no charge against you, comrade. We have spent a           
      pleasant evening with you: that is all.                               
  STRAKER. I gev my and to nobody, see?                                     
  MENDOZA [turning on him impressively] Young man: if I am tried, I         
      shall plead guilty, and explain what drove me from England,           
      home, and duty. Do you wish to have the respectable name of           
      Straker dragged through the mud of a Spanish criminal court? The      
      police will search me. They will find Louisa's portrait. It will      
      be published in the illustrated papers. You blench. It will be        
      your doing, remember.                                                 
  STRAKER [with baffled rage] I dont care about the court. It's avin        
      our name mixed up with yours that I object to, you blackmailin        
      swine, you.                                                           
  MENDOZA. Language unworthy of Louisa's brother! But no matter: you        
      are muzzled: that is enough for us. [He turns to face his own         
      men, who back uneasily across the amphitheatre towards the cave       
      to take refuge behind him, as a fresh party, muffled for              
      motoring, comes from the road in riotous spirits. Ann, who makes      
      straight for Tanner, comes first; then Violet, helped over the        
      rough ground by Hector holding her right hand and Ramsden her         
      left. Mendoza goes to his presidential block and seats himself        
      calmly with his rank and file grouped behind him, and his Staff,      
      consisting of Duval and the Anarchist on his right and the two        
      Social-Democrats on his left, supporting him in flank].               
  ANN. It's Jack!                                                           
  TANNER. Caught!                                                           
  HECTOR. Why, certainly it is. I said it was you, Tanner. Weve just        
      been stopped by a puncture: the road is full of nails.                
  VIOLET. What are you doing here with all these men?                       
  ANN. Why did you leave us without a word of warning?                      
  HECTOR. I wawnt that bunch of roses, Miss Whitefield. [To Tanner]         
      When we found you were gone, Miss Whitefield bet me a bunch of        
      roses my car would not overtake yours before you reached Monte        
      Carlo.                                                                
  TANNER. But this is not the road to Monte Carlo.                          
  HECTOR. No matter. Miss Whitefield tracked you at every stopping          
      place: she is a regular Sherlock Holmes.                              
  TANNER. The Life Force! I am lost.                                        
  OCTAVIUS [bounding gaily down from the road into the amphitheatre,        
      and coming between Tanner and Straker] I am so glad you are           
      safe, old chap. We were afraid you had been captured by               
      brigands.                                                             
  RAMSDEN [who has been staring at Mendoza] I seem to remember the          
      face of your friend here. [Mendoza rises politely and advances        
      with a smile between Ann and Ramsden].                                
  HECTOR. Why, so do I.                                                     
  OCTAVIUS. I know you perfectly well, sir; but I cant think where I        
      have met you.                                                         
  MENDOZA [to Violet] Do you remember me, madam?                            
  VIOLET. Oh, quite well; but I am so stupid about names.                   
  MENDOZA. It was at the Savoy Hotel. [To Hector] You, sir, used to         
      come with this lady [Violet] to lunch. [To Octavius] You, sir,        
      often brought this lady [Ann] and her mother to dinner on your        
      way to the Lyceum Theatre. [To Ramsden] You, sir, used to come        
      to supper, with [dropping his voice to a confidential but             
      perfectly audible whisper] several different ladies.                  
  RAMSDEN [angrily] Well, what is that to you, pray?                        
  OCTAVIUS. Why, Violet, I thought you hardly knew one another before       
      this trip, you and Malone!                                            
  VIOLET [vexed] I suppose this person was the manager.                     
  MENDOZA. The waiter, madam. I have a grateful recollection of you         
      all. I gathered from the bountiful way in which you treated me        
      that you all enjoyed your visits very much.                           
  VIOLET. What impertinence! [She turns her back on him, and goes up        
      the hill with Hector].                                                
  RAMSDEN. That will do, my friend. You do not expect these ladies to       
      treat you as an acquaintance, I suppose, because you have waited      
      on them at table.                                                     
  MENDOZA. Pardon me: it was you who claimed my acquaintance. The           
      ladies followed your example. However, this display of the            
      unfortunate manners of your class closes the incident. For the        
      future, you will please address me with the respect due to a          
      stranger and fellow traveller. [He turns haughtily away and           
      resumes his presidential seat].                                       
  TANNER. There! I have found one man on my journey capable of              
      reasonable conversation; and you all instinctively insult him.        
      Even the New Man is as bad as any of you. Enry: you have behaved      
      just like a miserable gentleman.                                      
  STRAKER. Gentleman! Not me.                                               
  RAMSDEN. Really, Tanner, this tone-                                       
  ANN. Dont mind him, Granny: you ought to know him by this time [she       
      takes his arm and coaxes him away to the hill to join Violet and      
      Hector, Octavius follows her, dog-like].                              
  VIOLET [calling from the hill] Here are the soldiers. They are            
      getting out of their motors.                                          
  DUVAL [panic-stricken] Oh, nom de Dieu!                                   
  THE ANARCHIST. Fools: the State is about to crush you because you         
      spared it at the prompting of the political hangers-on of the         
      bourgeoisie.                                                          
  THE SULKY SOCIAL-DEMOCRAT [argumentative to the last] On the              
      contrary, only by capturing the State machine-                        
  THE ANARCHIST. It is going to capture you.                                
  THE ROWDY SOCIAL DEMOCRAT [his anguish culminating] Ow, chack it.         
      Wot are we ere for? Wot are we wytin for?                             
  MENDOZA [between his teeth] Go on. Talk politics, you idiots:             
      nothing sounds more respectable. Keep it up, I tell you.              

    The soldiers line the road, commanding the amphitheatre with their      
rifles. The brigands, struggling with an overwhelming impulse to            
hide behind one another, look as unconcerned as they can. Mendoza           
rises superbly, with undaunted front. The officer in command steps          
down from the road into the amphitheatre; looks hard at the                 
brigands; and then inquiringly at Tanner.                                   

  THE OFFICER. Who are these men, Senor Ingles?                             
  TANNER. My escort.                                                        

    Mendoza, with a Mephistophelean smile, bows profoundly. An              
irrepressible grin runs from face to face among the brigands. They          
touch their hats, except the Anarchist, who defies the State with           
folded arms.                                                                

                               ACT FOUR                                     

    THE garden of a villa in Granada. Whoever wishes to know what it        
is like must go to Granada to see. One may prosaically specify a group      
of hills dotted with villas, the Alhambra on the top of one of the          
hills, and a considerable town in the valley, approached by dusty           
white roads in which the children, no matter what they are doing or         
thinking about, automatically whine for halfpence and reach out little      
clutching brown palms for them; but there is nothing in this                
description except the Alhambra, the begging, and the color of the          
roads, that does not fit Surrey as well as Spain. The difference is         
that the Surrey hills are comparatively small and ugly, and should          
properly be called the Surrey Protuberances; but these Spanish hills        
are of mountain stock: the amenity which conceals their size does           
not compromise their dignity.                                               
    This particular garden is on a hill opposite the Alhambra; and the      
villa is as expensive and pretentious as a villa must be if it is to        
be let furnished by the week to opulent American and English visitors.      
If we stand on the lawn at the foot of the garden and look uphill, our      
horizon is the stone balustrade of a flagged platform on the edge of        
infinite space at the top of the hill. Between us and this platform is      
a flower garden with a circular basin and fountain in the centre,           
surrounded by geometrical flower beds, gravel paths, and clipped yew        
trees in the genteelest order. The garden is higher than our lawn;          
so we reach it by a few steps in the middle of its embankment. The          
platform is higher again than the garden, from which we mount a couple      
more steps to look over the balustrade at a fine view of the town up        
the valley and of the hills that stretch away beyond it to where, in        
the remotest distance, they become mountains. On our left is the            
villa, accessible by steps from the left hand corner of the garden.         
Returning from the platform through the garden and down again to the        
lawn (a movement which leaves the villa behind us on our right) we          
find evidence of literary interests on the part of the tenants in           
the fact that there is no tennis net nor set of croquet hoops, but, on      
our left, a little iron garden table with books on it, mostly               
yellow-backed, and a chair beside it. A chair on the right has also         
a couple of open books upon it. There are no newspapers, a                  
circumstance which, with the absence of games, might lead an                
intelligent spectator to the most far reaching conclusions as to the        
sort of people who live in the villa. Such speculations are checked,        
however, on this delightfully fine afternoon, by the appearance at a        
little gate in a paling on our left, of Henry Straker in his                
professional costume. He opens the gate for an elderly gentleman,           
and follows him on to the lawn.                                             
    This elderly gentleman defies the Spanish sun in a black frock          
coat, tall silk hat, trousers in which narrow stripes of dark grey and      
lilac blend into a highly respectable color, and a black necktie            
tied into a bow over spotless linen. Probably therefore a man whose         
social position needs constant and scrupulous affirmation without           
regard to climate: one who would dress thus for the middle of the           
Sahara or the top of Mont Blanc. And since he has not the stamp of the      
class which accepts as its life-mission the advertizing and                 
maintenance of first rate tailoring and millinery, he looks vulgar          
in his finery, though in a working dress of any kind he would look          
dignified enough. He is a bullet cheeked man with a red complexion,         
stubbly hair, smallish eyes, a hard mouth that folds down at the            
corners, and a dogged chin. The looseness of skin that comes with           
age has attacked his throat and the laps of his cheeks; but he is           
still hard as an apple above the mouth; so that the upper half of           
his face looks younger than the lower. He has the self-confidence of        
one who has made money, and something of the truculence of one who has      
made it in a brutalizing struggle, his civility having under it a           
perceptible menace that he has other methods in reserve if                  
necessary. Withal, a man to be rather pitied when he is not to be           
feared; for there is something pathetic about him at times, as if           
the huge commercial machine which has worked him into his frock coat        
had allowed him very little of his own way and left his affections          
hungry and baffled. At the first word that falls from him it is             
clear that he is an Irishman whose native intonation has clung to           
him through many changes of place and rank. One can only guess that         
the original material of his speech was perhaps the surly Kerry             
brogue; but the degradation of speech that occurs in London,                
Glasgow, Dublin, and big cities generally has been at work on it so         
long that nobody but an arrant cockney would dream of calling it a          
brogue now; for its music is almost gone, though its surliness is           
still perceptible. Straker, being a very obvious cockney, inspires him      
with implacable contempt, as a stupid Englishman who cannot even speak      
his own language properly. Straker, on the other hand, regards the old      
gentleman's accent as a joke thoughtfully provided by Providence            
expressly for the amusement of the British race, and treats him             
normally with the indulgence due to an inferior and unlucky species,        
but occasionally with indignant alarm when the old gentleman shews          
signs of intending his Irish nonsense to be taken seriously.                

  STRAKER. I'll go tell the young lady. She said youd prefer to stay        
      here [he turns to go up through the garden to the villa].             
  THE IRISHMAN [who has been looking round him with lively curiosity]       
      The young lady? Thats Miss Violet, eh?                                
  STRAKER [stopping on the steps with sudden suspicion] Well, you           
      know, dont you?                                                       
  THE IRISHMAN. Do I?                                                       
  STRAKER [his temper rising] Well, do you or dont you?                     
  THE IRISHMAN. What business is that of yours?                             

    Straker, now highly indignant, comes back from the steps and            
confronts the visitor.                                                      

  STRAKER. I'll tell you what business it is of mine. Miss Robinson-        
  THE IRISHMAN [interrupting] Oh, her name is Robinson, is it? Thank        
      you.                                                                  
  STRAKER. Why, you dont know even her name?                                
  THE IRISHMAN. Yes I do, now that youve told me.                           
  STRAKER [after a moment of stupefaction at the old man's readiness        
      in repartee] Look here: what do you mean by gittin into my car        
      and lettin me bring you here if youre not the person I took that      
      note to?                                                              
  THE IRISHMAN. Who else did you take it to, pray?                          
  STRAKER. I took it to Mr Ector Malone, at Miss Robinson's request,        
      see? Miss Robinson is not my principal: I took it to oblige her.      
      I know Mr Malone; and he aint you, not by a long chalk. At the        
      hotel they told me that your name is Ector Malone-                    
  MALONE. Hector Malone.                                                    
  STRAKER [with calm superiority] Hector in your own country: thats         
      what comes o livin in provincial places like Ireland and              
      America. Over here youre Ector: if you avnt noticed it before         
      you soon will.                                                        

    The growing strain of the conversation is here relieved by Violet,      
who has sallied from the villa and through the garden to the steps,         
which she now descends, coming very opportunely between Malone and          
Straker.                                                                    

  VIOLET [to Straker] Did you take my message?                              
  STRAKER. Yes, miss. I took it to the hotel and sent it up, expecting      
      to see young Mr Malone. Then out walks this gent, and says it's       
      all right and he'll come with me. So as the hotel people said he      
      was Mr Ector Malone, I fetched him. And now he goes back on what      
      he said. But if he isnt the gentleman you meant, say the word:        
      it's easy enough to fetch him back again.                             
  MALONE. I should esteem it a great favor if I might have a short          
      conversation with you, madam. I am Hector's father, as this           
      bright Britisher would have guessed in the course of another          
      hour or so.                                                           
  STRAKER [coolly defiant] No, not in another year or so. When weve ad      
      you as long to polish up as weve ad im, perhaps youll begin to        
      look a little bit up to is mark. At present you fall a long way       
      short. Youve got too many aitches, for one thing. [To Violet,         
      amiably] All right, Miss: you want to talk to him: I shant            
      intrude. [He nods affably to Malone and goes out through the          
      little gate in the paling].                                           
  VIOLET [very civilly] I am so sorry, Mr Malone, if that man has been      
      rude to you. But what can we do? He is our chauffeur.                 
  MALONE. Your hwat?                                                        
  VIOLET. The driver of our automobile. He can drive a motor car at         
      seventy miles an hour, and mend it when it breaks down. We are        
      dependent on our motor cars; and our motor cars are dependent on      
      him; so of course we are dependent on him.                            
  MALONE. Ive noticed, madam, that every thousand dollars an                
      Englishman gets seems to add one to the number of people he's         
      dependent on. However, you neednt apologize for your man: I made      
      him talk on purpose. By doing so I learnt that youre stayin here      
      in Grannida with a party of English, including my son Hector.         
  VIOLET [conversationally] Yes. We intended to go to Nice; but we had      
      to follow a rather eccentric member of our party who started          
      first and came here. Wont you sit down? [She clears the nearest       
      chair of the two books on it].                                        
  MALONE [impressed by this attention] Thank you. [He sits down,            
      examining her curiously as she goes to the iron table to put          
      down the books. When she turns to him again, he says] Miss            
      Robinson, I believe?                                                  
  VIOLET [sitting down] Yes.                                                
  MALONE [taking a letter from his pocket] Your note to Hector runs as      
      follows [Violet is unable to repress a start. He pauses quietly       
      to take out and put on his spectacles, which have gold rims]:         
      "Dearest: they have all gone to the Alhambra for the afternoon.       
      I have shammed headache and have the garden all to myself. Jump       
      into Jack's motor: Straker will rattle you here in a jiffy.           
      Quick, quick, quick. Your loving Violet." [He looks at her; but       
      by this time she has recovered herself, and meets his spectacles      
      with perfect composure. He continues slowly] Now I dont know on       
      hwat terms young people associate in English society; but in          
      America that note would be considered to imply a very                 
      considerable degree of affectionate intimacy between the              
      parties.                                                              
  VIOLET. Yes: I know your son very well, Mr Malone. Have you any           
      objection?                                                            
  MALONE [somewhat taken aback] No, no objection exactly. Provided it       
      is understood that my son is altogether dependent on me, and          
      that I have to be consulted in any important step he may propose      
      to take.                                                              
  VIOLET. I am sure you would not be unreasonable with him, Mr Malone.      
  MALONE. I hope not, Miss Robinson; but at your age you might think        
      many things unreasonable that dont seem so to me.                     
  VIOLET [with a little shrug] Oh, well, I suppose theres no use our        
      playing at cross purposes, Mr Malone. Hector wants to marry me.       
  MALONE. I inferred from your note that he might. Well, Miss               
      Robinson, he is his own master; but if he marries you he shall        
      not have a rap from me. [He takes off his spectacles and pockets      
      them with the note].                                                  
  VIOLET [with some severity] That is not very complimentary to me, Mr      
      Malone.                                                               
  MALONE. I say nothing against you, Miss Robinson: I daresay you are       
      an amiable and excellent young lady. But I have other views for       
      Hector.                                                               
  VIOLET. Hector may not have other views for himself, Mr Malone.           
  MALONE. Possibly not. Then he does without me: thats all. I daresay       
      you are prepared for that. When a young lady writes to a young        
      man to come to her quick, quick, quick, money seems nothing and       
      love seems everything.                                                
  VIOLET [sharply] I beg your pardon, Mr Malone: I do not think             
      anything so foolish. Hector must have money.                          
  MALONE [staggered] Oh, very well, very well. No doubt he can work         
      for it.                                                               
  VIOLET. What is the use of having money if you have to work for it?       
      [She rises impatiently]. It's all nonsense, Mr Malone: you must       
      enable your son to keep up his position. It is his right.             
  MALONE [grimly] I should not advise you to marry him on the strength      
      of that right, Miss Robinson.                                         

    Violet, who has almost lost her temper, controls herself with an        
effort; unclenches her fingers; and resumes her seat with studied           
tranquillity and reasonableness.                                            

  VIOLET. What objection have you to me, pray? My social position is        
      as good as Hector's, to say the least. He admits it.                  
  MALONE [shrewdly] You tell him so from time to time, eh? Hector's         
      social position in England, Miss Robinson, is just what I choose      
      to buy for him. I have made him a fair offer. Let him pick out        
      the most historic house, castle, or abbey that England contains.      
      The very day he tells me he wants it for a wife worthy of its         
      traditions, I buy it for him, and give him the means of keeping       
      it up.                                                                
  VIOLET. What do you mean by a wife worthy of its traditions? Cannot       
      any well bred woman keep such a house for him?                        
  MALONE. No: she must be born to it.                                       
  VIOLET. Hector was not born to it, was he?                                
  MALONE. His granmother was a barefooted Irish girl that nursed me by      
      a turf fire. Let him marry another such, and I will not stint         
      her marriage portion. Let him raise himself socially with my          
      money or raise somebody else: so long as there is a social            
      profit somewhere, I'll regard my expenditure as justified. But        
      there must be a profit for someone. A marriage with you would         
      leave things just where they are.                                     
  VIOLET. Many of my relations would object very much to my marrying        
      the grandson of a common woman, Mr Malone. That may be                
      prejudice; but so is your desire to have him marry a title            
      prejudice.                                                            
  MALONE [rising, and approaching her with a scrutiny in which there        
      is a good deal of reluctant respect] You seem a pretty                
      straightforward downright sort of a young woman.                      
  VIOLET. I do not see why I should be made miserably poor because I        
      cannot make profits for you. Why do you want to make Hector           
      unhappy?                                                              
  MALONE. He will get over it all right enough. Men thrive better on        
      disappointments in love than on disappointments in money. I           
      daresay you think that sordid; but I know what I'm talking            
      about. Me father died of starvation in Ireland in the black 47.       
      Maybe youve heard of it.                                              
  VIOLET. The Famine?                                                       
  MALONE [with smouldering passion] No, the starvation. When a country      
      is full o food, and exporting it, there can be no famine. Me          
      father was starved dead; and I was starved out to America in me       
      mother's arms. English rule drove me and mine out of Ireland.         
      Well, you can keep Ireland. Me and me like are coming back to         
      buy England; and we'll buy the best of it. I want no middle           
      class properties and no middle class women for Hector. Thats          
      straightforward, isnt it, like yourself?                              
  VIOLET [icily pitying his sentimentality] Really, Mr Malone, I am         
      astonished to hear a man of your age and good sense talking in        
      that romantic way. Do you suppose English noblemen will sell          
      their places to you for the asking?                                   
  MALONE. I have the refusal of two of the oldest family mansions in        
      England. One historic owner cant afford to keep all the rooms         
      dusted: the other cant afford the death duties. What do you say       
      now?                                                                  
  VIOLET. Of course it is very scandalous; but surely you know that         
      the Government will sooner or later put a stop to all these           
      Socialistic attacks on property.                                      
  MALONE [grinning] D'y'think theyll be able to get that done before        
      I buy the house- or rather the abbey? Theyre both abbeys.             
  VIOLET [putting that aside rather impatiently] Oh, well, let us talk      
      sense, Mr Malone. You must feel that we havnt been talking sense      
      so far.                                                               
  MALONE. I cant say I do. I mean all I say.                                
  VIOLET. Then you dont know Hector as I do. He is romantic and faddy-      
      he gets it from you, I fancy- and he wants a certain sort of          
      wife to take care of him. Not a faddy sort of person, you know.       
  MALONE. Somebody like you, perhaps?                                       
  VIOLET [quietly] Well, yes. But you cannot very well ask me to            
      undertake this with absolutely no means of keeping up his             
      position.                                                             
  MALONE [alarmed] Stop a bit, stop a bit. Where are we getting to?         
      I'm not aware that I'm asking you to undertake anything.              
  VIOLET. Of course, Mr Malone, you can make it very difficult for me       
      to speak to you if you choose to misunderstand me.                    
  MALONE [half bewildered] I dont wish to take any unfair advantage;        
      but we seem to have got off the straight track somehow.               

    Straker, with the air of a man who has been making haste, opens         
the little gate, and admits Hector, who, snorting with indignation,         
comes upon the lawn, and is making for his father when Violet, greatly      
dismayed, springs up and intercepts him. Straker does not wait; at          
least he does not remain visibly within earshot.                            

  VIOLET. Oh, how unlucky! Now please, Hector, say nothing. Go away         
      until I have finished speaking to your father.                        
  HECTOR [inexorably] No, Violet: I mean to have this thing out, right      
      away. [He puts her aside; passes her by; and faces his father,        
      whose cheeks darken as his Irish blood begins to simmer]. Dad:        
      youve not played this hand straight.                                  
  MALONE. Hwat d'y'mean?                                                    
  HECTOR. Youve opened a letter addressed to me. Youve impersonated me      
      and stolen a march on this lady. Thats disawnerable.                  
  MALONE [threateningly] Now you take care what youre saying, Hector.       
      Take care, I tell you.                                                
  HECTOR. I have taken care. I am taking care. I'm taking care of my        
      honor and my position in English society.                             
  MALONE [hotly] Your position has been got by my money: do you know        
      that?                                                                 
  HECTOR. Well, youve spoiled it all by opening that letter. A letter       
      from an English lady, not addressed to you- a cawnfidential           
      letter! a dullicate letter! a private letter! opened by my            
      father! Thats a sort of thing a man cant struggle against in          
      England. The sooner we go back together the better. [He appeals       
      mutely to the heavens to witness the shame and anguish of two         
      outcasts].                                                            
  VIOLET [snubbing him with an instinctive dislike for scene making]        
      Dont be unreasonable, Hector. It was quite natural for Mr Malone      
      to open my letter: his name was on the envelope.                      
  MALONE. There! Youve no common sense, Hector. I thank you, Miss           
      Robinson.                                                             
  HECTOR. I thank you, too. It's very kind of you. My father knows no       
      better.                                                               
  MALONE [furiously clenching his fists] Hector-                            
  HECTOR [with undaunted moral force] Oh, it's no use hectoring me. A       
      private letter's a private letter, dad: you cant get over that.       
  MALONE [raising his voice] I wont be talked back to by you,               
      d'y'hear?                                                             
  VIOLET. Ssh! please, please. Here they all come.                          

    Father and son, checked, glare mutely at one another as Tanner          
comes in through the little gate with Ramsden, followed by Octavius         
and Ann.                                                                    

  VIOLET. Back already!                                                     
  TANNER. The Alhambra is not open this afternoon.                          
  VIOLET. What a sell!                                                      

    Tanner passes on, and presently finds himself between Hector and a      
strange elder, both apparently on the verge of personal combat. He          
looks from one to the other for an explanation. They sulkily avoid his      
eye, and nurse their wrath in silence.                                      

  RAMSDEN. Is it wise for you to be out in the sunshine with such a         
      headache, Violet?                                                     
  TANNER. Have you recovered too, Malone?                                   
  VIOLET. Oh, I forgot. We have not all met before. Mr Malone: wont         
      you introduce your father?                                            
  HECTOR [with Roman firmness] No, I will not. He is no father of           
      mine.                                                                 
  MALONE [very angry] You disown your dad before your English friends,      
      do you?                                                               
  VIOLET. Oh, please dont make a scene.                                     

    Ann and Octavius, lingering near the gate, exchange an                  
astonished glance, and discreetly withdraw up the steps to the garden,      
where they can enjoy the disturbance without intruding. On their way        
to the steps Ann sends a little grimace of mute sympathy to Violet,         
who is standing with her back to the little table, looking on in            
helpless annoyance as her husband soars to higher and higher moral          
eminences without the least regard to the old man's millions.               

  HECTOR. I'm very sorry, Miss Rawbnsn; but I'm contending for a            
      principle. I am a son, and, I hope, a dutiful one; but before         
      everything I'm a Mahn!!! And when dad treats my private letters       
      as his own, and takes it on himself to say that I shant marry         
      you if I am happy and fortunate enough to gain your consent,          
      then I just snap my fingers and go my own way.                        
  TANNER. Marry Violet!                                                     
  RAMSDEN. Are you in your senses?                                          
  TANNER. Do you forget what we told you?                                   
  HECTOR [recklessly] I dont care what you told me.                         
  RAMSDEN [scandalized] Tut tut, sir! Monstrous! [he flings away            
      towards the gate, his elbows quivering with indignation].             
  TANNER. Another madman! These men in love should be locked up. [He        
      gives Hector up as hopeless, and turns away towards the garden;       
      but Malone, taking offence in a new direction, follows him and        
      compels him by the aggressiveness of his tone, to stop].              
  MALONE. I dont understand this. Is Hector not good enough for this        
      lady, pray?                                                           
  TANNER. My dear sir, the lady is married already. Hector knows it;        
      and yet he persists in his infatuation. Take him home and lock        
      him up.                                                               
  MALONE [bitterly] So this is the highborn social tone Ive spoilt be       
      me ignorant, uncultivated behavior! Makin love to a married           
      woman! [He comes angrily between Hector and Violet, and almost        
      bawls into Hector's left ear] Youve picked up that habit of the       
      British aristocracy, have you?                                        
  HECTOR. Thats all right. Dont you trouble yourself about that. I'll       
      answer for the morality of what I'm doing.                            
  TANNER [coming forward to Hector's right hand with flashing eyes]         
      Well said, Malone! You also see that mere marriage laws are not       
      morality! I agree with you; but unfortunately Violet does not.        
  MALONE. I take leave to doubt that, sir. [Turning on Violet] Let me       
      tell you, Mrs Robinson, or whatever your right name is, you had       
      no right to send that letter to my son when you were the wife         
      of another man.                                                       
  HECTOR [outraged] This is the last straw. Dad: you have insulted my       
      wife.                                                                 
  MALONE. Your wife!                                                        
  TANNER. You the missing husband! Another moral impostor! [He smites       
      his brow, and collapses into Malone's chair].                         
  MALONE. Youve married without my consent!                                 
  RAMSDEN. You have deliberately humbugged us, sir!                         
  HECTOR. Here: I have had just about enough of being badgered. Violet      
      and I are married: thats the long and the short of it. Now what       
      have you got to say- any of you?                                      
  MALONE. I know what Ive got to say. She's married a beggar.               
  HECTOR. No: she's married a Worker [his American pronunciation            
      imparts an overwhelming intensity to this simple and unpopular        
      word]. I start to earn my own living this very afternoon.             
  MALONE [sneering angrily] Yes: youre very plucky now, because you         
      got your remittance from me yesterday or this morning, I reckon.      
      Waitl it's spent. You wont be so full of cheek then.                  
  HECTOR [producing a letter from his pocketbook] Here it is                
      [thrusting it on his father]. Now you just take your remittance       
      and yourself out of my life. I'm done with remittances; and I'm       
      done with you. I dont sell the privilege of insulting my wife         
      for a thousand dollars.                                               
  MALONE [deeply wounded and full of concern] Hector: you dont know         
      what poverty is.                                                      
  HECTOR [fervidly] Well, I wawnt to know what it is. I wawnt'be a          
      Mahn. Violet: you come along with me, to your own home: I'll see      
      you through.                                                          
  OCTAVIUS [jumping down from the garden to the lawn and running to         
      Hector's left hand] I hope youll shake hands with me before you       
      go, Hector. I admire and respect you more than I can say. [He is      
      affected almost to tears as they shake hands].                        
  VIOLET [also almost in tears, but of vexation] Oh, dont be an idiot,      
      Tavy. Hector's about as fit to become a workman as you are.           
  TANNER [rising from his chair on the other side of Hector] Never          
      fear: theres no question of his becoming a navvy, Mrs Malone.         
      [To Hector] Theres really no difficulty about capital to start        
      with. Treat me as a friend: draw on me.                               
  OCTAVIUS [impulsively] Or on me.                                          
  MALONE [with fierce jealousy] Who wants your durty money? Who should      
      he draw on but his own father? [Tanner and Octavius recoil,           
      Octavius rather hurt, Tanner consoled by the solution of the          
      money difficulty. Violet looks up hopefully]. Hector: dont be         
      rash, my boy. I'm sorry for what I said: I never meant to insult      
      Violet: I take it all back. She's just the wife you want: there!      
  HECTOR [patting him on the shoulder] Well, thats all right, dad. Say      
      no more: we're friends again. Only, I take no money from              
      anybody.                                                              
  MALONE [pleading abjectly] Dont be hard on me, Hector. I'd rather         
      you quarrelled and took the money than made friends and starved.      
      You dont know what the world is: I do.                                
  HECTOR. No, no, NO. Thats fixed: thats not going to change. [He           
      passes his father inexorably by, and goes to Violet]. Come, Mrs       
      Malone: youve got to move to the hotel with me, and take your         
      proper place before the world.                                        
  VIOLET. But I must go in, dear, and tell Davis to pack. Wont you go       
      on and make them give you a room overlooking the garden for me?       
      I'll join you in half an hour.                                        
  HECTOR. Very well. Youll dine with us, Dad, wont you?                     
  MALONE [eager to conciliate him] Yes, yes.                                
  HECTOR. See you all later. [He waves his hand to Ann, who has now         
      been joined by Tanner, Octavius, and Ramsden in the garden, and       
      goes out through the little gate, leaving his father and Violet       
      together on the lawn].                                                
  MALONE. Youll try to bring him to his senses, Violet: I know you          
      will.                                                                 
  VIOLET. I had no idea he could be so headstrong. If he goes on like       
      that, what can I do?                                                  
  MALONE. Dont be discurridged: domestic pressure may be slow; but          
      it's sure. Youll wear him down. Promise me you will.                  
  VIOLET. I will do my best. Of course I think it's the greatest            
      nonsense deliberately making us poor like that.                       
  MALONE. Of course it is.                                                  
  VIOLET [after a moment's reflection] You had better give me the           
      remittance. He will want it for his hotel bill. I'll see whether      
      I can induce him to accept it. Not now, of course, but                
      presently.                                                            
  MALONE [eagerly] Yes, yes, yes: thats just the thing [he hands her        
      the thousand dollar bill, and adds cunningly] Y'understand that       
      this is only a bachelor allowance.                                    
  VIOLET [coolly] Oh, quite. [She takes it]. Thank you. By the way, Mr      
      Malone, those two houses you mentioned- the abbeys.                   
  MALONE. Yes?                                                              
  VIOLET. Dont take one of them until Ive seen it. One never knows          
      what may be wrong with these places.                                  
  MALONE. I wont. I'll do nothing without consulting you, never fear.       
  VIOLET [politely, but without a ray of gratitude] Thanks: that will       
      be much the best way. [She goes calmly back to the villa,             
      escorted obsequiously by Malone to the upper end of the garden].      
  TANNER [drawing Ramsden's attention to Malone's cringing attitude as      
      he takes leave of Violet] And that poor devil is a billionaire!       
      one of the master spirits of the age! Led in a string like a pug      
      dog by the first girl who takes the trouble to despise him! I         
      wonder will it ever come to that with me. [He comes down to the       
      lawn].                                                                
  RAMSDEN [following him] The sooner the better for you.                    
  MALONE [slapping his hands as he returns through the garden) That'll      
      be a grand woman for Hector. I wouldnt exchange her for ten           
      duchesses. [He descends to the lawn and comes between Tanner and      
      Ramsden].                                                             
  RAMSDEN [very civil to the billionaire] It's an unexpected pleasure       
      to find you in this corner of the world, Mr Malone. Have you          
      come to buy up the Alhambra?                                          
  MALONE. Well, I dont say I mightnt. I think I could do better with        
      it than the Spanish government. But thats not what I came about.      
      To tell you the truth, about a month ago I overheard a deal           
      between two men over a bundle of shares. They differed about the      
      price: they were young and greedy, and didnt know that if the         
      shares were worth what was bid for them they must be worth what       
      was asked, the margin being too small to be of any account, you       
      see. To amuse meself, I cut in and bought the shares. Well, to        
      this day I havnt found out what the business is. The office is        
      in this town; and the name is Mendoza, Limited. Now whether           
      Mendoza's a mine, or a steamboat line, or a bank, or a patent         
      article-                                                              
  TANNER. He's a man. I know him: his principles are thoroughly             
      commercial. Let us take you round the town in our motor, Mr           
      Malone, and call on him on the way.                                   
  MALONE. If youll be so kind, yes. And may I ask who-                      
  TANNER. Mr Roebuck Ramsden, a very old friend of your                     
      daughter-in-law.                                                      
  MALONE. Happy to meet you, Mr Ramsden.                                    
  RAMSDEN. Thank you. Mr Tanner is also one of our circle.                  
  MALONE. Glad to know you also, Mr Tanner.                                 
  TANNER. Thanks. [Malone and Ramsden go out very amicably through the      
      little gate. Tanner calls to Octavius, who is wandering in the        
      garden with Ann] Tavy! [Tavy comes to the steps, Tanner whispers      
      loudly to him] Violet's father-in-law is a financier of               
      brigands. [Tanner hurries away to overtake Malone and Ramsden.        
      Ann strolls to the steps with an idle impulse to torment              
      Octavius].                                                            
  ANN. Wont you go with them, Tavy?                                         
  OCTAVIUS [tears suddenly flushing his eyes] You cut me to the heart,      
      Ann, by wanting me to go [he comes down on the lawn to hide his       
      face from her. She follows him caressingly].                          
  ANN. Poor Ricky Ticky Tavy! Poor heart!                                   
  OCTAVIUS. It belongs to you, Ann. Forgive me: I must speak of it. I       
      love you. You know I love you.                                        
  ANN. Whats the good, Tavy? You know that my mother is determined          
      that I shall marry Jack.                                              
  OCTAVIUS [amazed] Jack!                                                   
  ANN. It seems absurd, doesnt it?                                          
  OCTAVIUS [with growing resentment] Do you mean to say that Jack has       
      been playing with me all this time? That he has been urging me        
      not to marry you because he intends to marry you himself?             
  ANN [alarmed] No, no: you mustnt lead him to believe that I said          
      that. I dont for a moment think that Jack knows his own mind.         
      But it's clear from my father's will that he wished me to marry       
      Jack. And my mother is set on it.                                     
  OCTAVIUS. But you are not bound to sacrifice yourself to the wishes       
      of your parents.                                                      
  ANN. My father loved me. My mother loves me. Surely their wishes are      
      a better guide than my own selfishness.                               
  OCTAVIUS. Oh, I know how unselfish you are, Ann. But believe me-          
      though I know I am speaking in my own interest- there is another      
      side to this question. Is it fair to Jack to marry him if you do      
      not love him? Is it fair to destroy my happiness as well as your      
      own if you can bring yourself to love me?                             
  ANN [looking at him with a faint impulse of pity] Tavy, my dear, you      
      are a nice creature- a good boy.                                      
  OCTAVIUS [humiliated] Is that all?                                        
  ANN [mischievously in spite of her pity] Thats a great deal, I            
      assure you. You would always worship the ground I trod on,            
      wouldnt you?                                                          
  OCTAVIUS. I do. It sounds ridiculous; but it's no exaggeration. I         
      do; and I always shall.                                               
  ANN. Always is a long word, Tavy. You see, I shall have to live up        
      always to your idea of my divinity; and I dont think I could do       
      that if we were married. But if I marry Jack, youll never be          
      disillusioned- at least not until I grow too old.                     
  OCTAVIUS. I too shall grow old, Ann. And when I am eighty, one white      
      hair of the woman I love will make me tremble more than the           
      thickest gold tress from the most beautiful young head.               
  ANN [quite touched] Oh, thats poetry, Tavy, real poetry. It gives me      
      that strange sudden sense of an echo from a former existence          
      which always seems to me such a striking proof that we have           
      immortal souls.                                                       
  OCTAVIUS. Do you believe that it is true?                                 
  ANN. Tavy: if it is to come true, you must lose me as well as love        
      me.                                                                   
  OCTAVIUS. Oh! [he hastily sits down at the little table and covers        
      his face with his hands].                                             
  ANN [with conviction] Tavy: I wouldnt for worlds destroy your             
      illusions. I can neither take you nor let you go. I can see           
      exactly what will suit you. You must be a sentimental old             
      bachelor for my sake.                                                 
  OCTAVIUS [desperately] Ann: I'll kill myself.                             
  ANN. Oh no, you wont: that wouldnt be kind. You wont have a bad           
      time. You will be very nice to women; and you will go a good          
      deal to the opera. A broken heart is a very pleasant complaint        
      for a man in London if he has a comfortable income.                   
  OCTAVIUS [considerably cooled, but believing that he is only              
      recovering his self-control] I know you mean to be kind, Ann.         
      Jack has persuaded you that cynicism is a good tonic for me. [He      
      rises with quiet dignity].                                            
  ANN [studying him slyly] You see, I'm disillusionizing you already.       
      Thats what I dread.                                                   
  OCTAVIUS. You do not dread disillusionizing Jack.                         
  ANN [her face lighting up with mischievous ecstasy- whispering] I         
      cant: he has no illusions about me. I shall surprise Jack the         
      other way. Getting over an unfavorable impression is ever so          
      much easier than living up to an ideal. Oh, I shall enrapture         
      Jack sometimes!                                                       
  OCTAVIUS [resuming the calm phase of despair, and beginning to enjoy      
      his broken heart and delicate attitude without knowing it] I          
      dont doubt that. You will enrapture him always. And he- the           
      fool!- thinks you would make him wretched.                            
  ANN. Yes: thats the difficulty, so far.                                   
  OCTAVIUS [heroically] Shall *I* tell him that you love him?               
  ANN [quickly] Oh no: he'd run away again.                                 
  OCTAVIUS [shocked] Ann: would you marry an unwilling man?                 
  ANN. What a queer creature you are, Tavy! Theres no such thing as a       
      willing man when you really go for him. [She laughs naughtily].       
      I'm shocking you, I suppose. But you know you are really getting      
      a sort of satisfaction already in being out of danger yourself.       
  OCTAVIUS [startled] Satisfaction! [Reproachfully] You say that to         
      me!                                                                   
  ANN. Well, if it were really agony, would you ask for more of it?         
  OCTAVIUS. Have I asked for more of it?                                    
  ANN. You have offered to tell Jack that I love him. Thats                 
      self-sacrifice, I suppose; but there must be some satisfaction        
      in it. Perhaps it's because youre a poet. You are like the bird       
      that presses its breast against the sharp thorn to make itself        
      sing.                                                                 
  OCTAVIUS. It's quite simple. I love you; and I want you to be happy.      
      You dont love me; so I cant make you happy myself; but I can          
      help another man to do it.                                            
  ANN. Yes: it seems quite simple. But I doubt if we ever know why we       
      do things. The only really simple thing is to go straight for         
      what you want and grab it. I suppose I dont love you, Tavy; but       
      sometimes I feel as if I should like to make a man of you             
      somehow. You are very foolish about women.                            
  OCTAVIUS [almost coldly] I am content to be what I am in that             
      respect.                                                              
  ANN. Then you must keep away from them, and only dream about them.        
      I wouldnt marry you for worlds, Tavy.                                 
  OCTAVIUS. I have no hope, Ann: I accept my ill luck. But I dont           
      think you quite know how much it hurts.                               
  ANN. You are so softhearted! It's queer that you should be so             
      different from Violet. Violet's as hard as nails.                     
  OCTAVIUS. Oh no. I am sure Violet is thoroughly womanly at heart.         
  ANN [with some impatience] Why do you say that? Is it unwomanly to        
      be thoughtful and businesslike and sensible? Do you want Violet       
      to be an idiot- or something worse, like me?                          
  OCTAVIUS. Something worse- like you! What do you mean, Ann?               
  ANN. Oh well, I dont mean that, of course. But I have a great             
      respect for Violet. She gets her own way always.                      
  OCTAVIUS [sighing] So do you.                                             
  ANN. Yes; but somehow she gets it without coaxing- without having to      
      make people sentimental about her.                                    
  OCTAVIUS [with brotherly callousness] Nobody could get very               
      sentimental about Violet, I think, pretty as she is.                  
  ANN. Oh yes they could, if she made them.                                 
  OCTAVIUS. But surely no really nice woman would deliberately              
      practise on men's instincts in that way.                              
  ANN [throwing up her hands] Oh, Tavy, Tavy, Ricky Ticky Tavy, heaven      
      help the woman who marries you!                                       
  OCTAVIUS [his passion reviving at the name] Oh why, why, why do you       
      say that? Dont torment me. I dont understand.                         
  ANN. Suppose she were to tell fibs, and lay snares for men?               
  OCTAVIUS. Do you think *I* could marry such a woman- I, who have          
      known and loved you?                                                  
  ANN. Hm! Well, at all events, she wouldnt let you if she were wise.       
      So thats settled. And now I cant talk any more. Say you forgive       
      me, and that the subject is closed.                                   
  OCTAVIUS. I have nothing to forgive; and the subject is closed. And       
      if the wound is open, at least you shall never see it bleed.          
  ANN. Poetic to the last, Tavy. Goodbye, dear. [She pats his cheek;        
      has an impulse to kiss him and then another impulse of distaste       
      which prevents her; finally runs away through the garden and          
      into the villa].                                                      

    Octavius again takes refuge at the table, bowing his head on his        
arms and sobbing softly. Mrs Whitefield, who has been pottering             
round the Granada shop, and has a net full of little parcels in her         
hand, comes in through the gate and sees him.                               

  MRS WHITEFIELD [running to him and lifting his head] Whats the            
      matter, Tavy? Are you ill?                                            
  OCTAVIUS. No, nothing, nothing.                                           
  MRS WHITEFIELD [still holding his head, anxiously] But youre crying.      
      Is it about Violet's marriage?                                        
  OCTAVIUS. No, no. Who told you about Violet?                              
  MRS WHITEFIELD [restoring the head to its owner] I met Roebuck and        
      that awful old Irishman. Are you sure youre not ill? Whats the        
      matter?                                                               
  OCTAVIUS [affectionately] It's nothing. Only a man's broken heart.        
      Doesnt that sound ridiculous?                                         
  MRS WHITEFIELD. But what is it all about? Has Ann been doing              
      anything to you?                                                      
  OCTAVIUS. It's not Ann's fault. And dont think for a moment that I        
      blame you.                                                            
  MRS WHITEFIELD [startled] For what?                                       
  OCTAVIUS [pressing her hand consolingly] For nothing. I said I didnt      
      blame you.                                                            
  MRS WHITEFIELD. But I havnt done anything. Whats the matter?              
  OCTAVIUS [smiling sadly] Cant you guess? I daresay you are right to       
      prefer Jack to me as a husband for Ann; but I love Ann; and it        
      hurts rather. [He rises and moves away from her towards the           
      middle of the lawn].                                                  
  MRS WHITEFIELD [following him hastily] Does Ann say that I want her       
      to marry Jack?                                                        
  OCTAVIUS. Yes: she has told me.                                           
  MRS WHITEFIELD [thoughtfully] Then I'm very sorry for you, Tavy.          
      It's only her way of saying she wants to marry Jack. Little she       
      cares what *I* say or what *I* want!                                  
  OCTAVIUS. But she would not say it unless she believed it. Surely         
      you dont suspect Ann of- of deceit!                                   
  MRS WHITEFIELD. Well, never mind, Tavy. I dont know which is best         
      for a young man: to know too little, like you, or too much, like      
      Jack.                                                                 

    Tanner returns.                                                         

  TANNER. Well, Ive disposed of old Malone. Ive introduced him to           
      Mendoza, Limited; and left the two brigands together to talk it       
      out. Hullo, Tavy! anything wrong?                                     
  OCTAVIUS. I must go wash my face, I see. [To Mrs Whitefield] Tell         
      him what you wish. [To Tanner] You may take it from me, Jack,         
      that Ann approves of it.                                              
  TANNER [puzzled by his manner] Approves of what?                          
  OCTAVIUS. Of what Mrs Whitefield wishes. [He goes his way with sad        
      dignity to the villa].                                                
  TANNER [to Mrs Whitefield] This is very mysterious. What is it you        
      wish? It shall be done, whatever it is.                               
  MRS WHITEFIELD [with snivelling gratitude] Thank you, Jack. [She          
      sits down. Tanner brings the other chair from the table and sits      
      close to her with his elbows on his knees, giving her his whole       
      attention]. I dont know why it is that other people's children        
      are so nice to me, and that my own have so little consideration       
      for me. It's no wonder I dont seem able to care for Ann and           
      Rhoda as I do for you and Tavy and Violet. It's a very queer          
      world. It used to be so straightforward and simple; and now           
      nobody seems to think and feel as they ought. Nothing has been        
      right since that speech that Professor Tyndall made at Belfast.       
  TANNER. Yes: life is more complicated than we used to think. But          
      what am I to do for you?                                              
  MRS WHITEFIELD. Thats just what I want to tell you. Of course youll       
      marry Ann whether I like it or not-                                   
  TANNER [starting] It seems to me that I shall presently be married        
      to Ann whether I like it myself or not.                               
  MRS WHITEFIELD [peacefully] Oh, very likely you will: you know what       
      she is when she has set her mind on anything. But dont put it on      
      me: thats all I ask. Tavy has just let out that she's been            
      saying that I am making her marry you; and the poor boy is            
      breaking his heart about it; for he is in love with her himself,      
      though what he sees in her so wonderful, goodness knows: *I*          
      dont. It's no use telling Tavy that Ann puts things into              
      people's heads by telling them that I want them when the thought      
      of them never crossed my mind. It only sets Tavy against me. But      
      you know better than that. So if you marry her, dont put the          
      blame on me.                                                          
  TANNER [emphatically] I havnt the slightest intention of marrying         
      her.                                                                  
  MRS WHITEFIELD [slyly] She'd suit you better than Tavy. She'd meet        
      her match in you, Jack. I'd like to see her meet her match.           
  TANNER. No man is a match for a woman, except with a poker and a          
      pair of hobnailed boots. Not always even then. Anyhow, *I* cant       
      take the poker to her. I should be a mere slave.                      
  MRS WHITEFIELD. No: she's afraid of you. At all events, you would         
      tell her the truth about herself. She wouldnt be able to slip         
      out of it as she does with me.                                        
  TANNER. Everybody would call me a brute if I told Ann the truth           
      about herself in terms of her own moral code. To begin with, Ann      
      says things that are not strictly true.                               
  MRS WHITEFIELD. I'm glad somebody sees she is not an angel.               
  TANNER. In short- to put it as a husband would put it when                
      exasperated to the point of speaking out- she is a liar. And          
      since she has plunged Tavy head over ears in love with her            
      without any intention of marrying him, she is a coquette,             
      according to the standard definition of a coquette as a woman         
      who rouses passions she has no intention of gratifying. And as        
      she has now reduced you to the point of being willing to              
      sacrifice me at the altar for the mere satisfaction of getting        
      me to call her a liar to her face, I may conclude that she is a       
      bully as well. She cant bully men as she bullies women; so she        
      habitually and unscrupulously uses her personal fascination to        
      make men give her whatever she wants. That makes her almost           
      something for which I know no polite name.                            
  MRS WHITEFIELD [in mild expostulation] Well, you cant expect              
      perfection, Jack.                                                     
  TANNER. I dont. But what annoys me is that Ann does. I know               
      perfectly well that all this about her being a liar and a bully       
      and a coquette and so forth is a trumped-up moral indictment          
      which might be brought against anybody. We all lie; we all bully      
      as much as we dare; we all bid for admiration without the least       
      intention of earning it; we all get as much rent as we can out        
      of our powers of fascination. If Ann would admit this I shouldnt      
      quarrel with her. But she wont. If she has children she'll take       
      advantage of their telling lies to amuse herself by whacking          
      them. If another woman makes eyes at me, she'll refuse to know        
      a coquette. She will do just what she likes herself whilst            
      insisting on everybody else doing what the conventional code          
      prescribes. In short, I can stand everything except her               
      confounded hypocrisy. Thats what beats me.                            
  MRS WHITEFIELD [carried away by the relief of hearing her own             
      opinion so eloquently expressed] Oh, she is a hypocrite. She is:      
      she is. Isnt she?                                                     
  TANNER. Then why do you want to marry me to her?                          
  MRS WHITEFIELD [querulously] There now! put it on me, of course. I        
      never thought of it until Tavy told me she said I did. But, you       
      know, I'm very fond of Tavy: he's a sort of son to me; and I          
      dont want him to be trampled on and made wretched.                    
  TANNER. Whereas I dont matter, I suppose.                                 
  MRS WHITEFIELD. Oh, you are different, somehow: you are able to take      
      care of yourself. Youd serve her out. And anyhow, she must marry      
      somebody.                                                             
  TANNER. Aha! there speaks the life instinct. You detest her; but you      
      feel that you must get her married.                                   
  MRS WHITEFIELD [rising, shocked] Do you mean that I detest my own         
      daughter! Surely you dont believe me to be so wicked and              
      unnatural as that, merely because I see her faults.                   
  TANNER [cynically] You love her, then?                                    
  MRS WHITEFIELD. Why, of course I do. What queer things you say,           
      Jack! We cant help loving our own blood relations.                    
  TANNER. Well, perhaps it saves unpleasantness to say so. But for my       
      part, I suspect that the tables of consanguinity have a natural       
      basis in a natural repugnance [he rises].                             
  MRS WHITEFIELD. You shouldnt say things like that, Jack. I hope you       
      wont tell Ann that I have been speaking to you. I only wanted to      
      set myself right with you and Tavy. I couldnt sit mumchance and       
      have everything put on me.                                            
  TANNER [politely] Quite so.                                               
  MRS WHITEFIELD [dissatisfied] And now Ive only made matters worse.        
      Tavy's angry with me because I dont worship Ann. And when it's        
      been put into my head that Ann ought to marry you, what can I         
      say except that it would serve her right?                             
  TANNER. Thank you.                                                        
  MRS WHITEFIELD. Now dont be silly and twist what I say into               
      something I dont mean. I ought to have fair play-                     

    Ann comes from the villa, followed presently by Violet, who is          
dressed for driving.                                                        

  ANN [coming to her mother's right hand with threatening suavity]          
      Well, mamma darling, you seem to be having a delightful chat          
      with Jack. We can hear you all over the place.                        
  MRS WHITEFIELD [appalled] Have you overheard-                             
  TANNER. Never fear: Ann is only- well, we were discussing that habit      
      of hers just now. She hasnt heard a word.                             
  MRS WHITEFIELD [stoutly] I dont care whether she has or not: I have       
      a right to say what I please.                                         
  VIOLET [arriving on the lawn and coming between Mrs Whitefield and        
      Tanner] Ive come to say goodbye. I'm off for my honeymoon.            
  MRS WHITEFIELD [crying] Oh, dont say that, Violet. And no wedding,        
      no breakfast, no clothes, nor anything.                               
  VIOLET [petting her] It wont be for long.                                 
  MRS WHITEFIELD. Dont let him take you to America. Promise me that         
      you wont.                                                             
  VIOLET [very decidedly] I should think not, indeed. Dont cry, dear:       
      I'm only going to the hotel.                                          
  MRS WHITEFIELD. But going in that dress, with your luggage, makes         
      one realize- [she chokes, and then breaks out again] How I wish       
      you were my daughter, Violet!                                         
  VIOLET [soothing her] There, there: so I am. Ann will be jealous.         
  MRS WHITEFIELD. Ann doesnt care a bit for me.                             
  ANN. Fie, mother! Come, now: you mustnt cry any more: you know            
      Violet doesnt like it [Mrs Whitefield dries her eyes, and             
      subsides].                                                            
  VIOLET. Goodbye, Jack.                                                    
  TANNER. Goodbye, Violet.                                                  
  VIOLET. The sooner you get married too, the better. You will be much      
      less misunderstood.                                                   
  TANNER [restively] I quite expect to get married in the course of         
      the afternoon. You all seem to have set your minds on it.             
  VIOLET. You might do worse. [To Mrs Whitefield: putting her arm           
      round her] Let me take you to the hotel with me: the drive will       
      do you good. Come in and get a wrap. [She takes her towards the       
      villa].                                                               
  MRS WHITEFIELD [as they go up through the garden] I dont know what        
      I shall do when you are gone, with no one but Ann in the house;       
      and she always occupied with the men! It's not to be expected         
      that your husband will care to be bothered with an old woman          
      like me. Oh, you neednt tell me: politeness is all very well;         
      but I know what people think- [She talks herself and Violet out       
      of sight and hearing].                                                

    Ann, alone with Tanner, watches him and waits. He makes an              
irresolute movement towards the gate; but some magnetism in her             
draws him to her, a broken man.                                             

  ANN. Violet is quite right. You ought to get married.                     
  TANNER [explosively] Ann: I will not marry you. Do you hear? I wont,      
      wont, wont, wont, WONT marry you.                                     
  ANN [placidly] Well, nobody axd you, sir she said, sir she said, sir      
      she said. So thats settled.                                           
  TANNER. Yes, nobody has asked me; but everybody treats the thing as       
      settled. It's in the air. When we meet, the others go away on         
      absurd pretexts to leave us alone together. Ramsden no longer         
      scowls at me: his eye beams, as if he were already giving you         
      away to me in church. Tavy refers me to your mother and gives         
      me his blessing. Straker openly treats you as his future              
      employer: it was he who first told me of it.                          
  ANN. Was that why you ran away?                                           
  TANNER. Yes, only to be stopped by a lovesick brigand and run down        
      like a truant schoolboy.                                              
  ANN. Well, if you dont want to be married, you neednt be [she turns       
      away from him and sits down, much at her ease].                       
  TANNER [following her] Does any man want to be hanged? Yet men let        
      themselves be hanged without a struggle for life, though they         
      could at least give the chaplain a black eye. We do the world's       
      will, not our own. I have a frightful feeling that I shall let        
      myself be married because it is the world's will that you should      
      have a husband.                                                       
  ANN. I daresay I shall, someday.                                          
  TANNER. Buy why me? me of all men! Marriage is to me apostasy,            
      profanation of the sanctuary of my soul, violation of my              
      manhood, sale of my birthright, shameful surrender, ignominious       
      capitulation, acceptance of defeat. I shall decay like a thing        
      that has served its purpose and is done with; I shall change          
      from a man with a future to a man with a past; I shall see in         
      the greasy eyes of all the other husbands their relief at the         
      arrival of a new prisoner to share their ignominy. The young men      
      will scorn me as one who has sold out: to the women I, who have       
      always been an enigma and a possibility, shall be merely              
      somebody else's property- and damaged goods at that: a                
      secondhand man at best.                                               
  ANN. Well, your wife can put on a cap and make herself ugly to keep       
      you in countenance, like my grandmother.                              
  TANNER. So that she may make her triumph more insolent by publicly        
      throwing away the bait the moment the trap snaps on the victim!       
  ANN. After all, though, what difference would it make? Beauty is all      
      very well at first sight; but who ever looks at it when it has        
      been in the house three days? I thought our pictures very lovely      
      when Papa bought them; but I havnt looked at them for years. You      
      never bother about my looks: you are too well used to me. I           
      might be the umbrella stand.                                          
  TANNER. You lie, you vampire: you lie.                                    
  ANN. Flatterer. Why are you trying to fascinate me, Jack, if you          
      dont want to marry me?                                                
  TANNER. The Life Force. I am in the grip of the Life Force.               
  ANN. I dont understand in the least: it sounds like the Life Guards.      
  TANNER. Why dont you marry Tavy? He is willing. Can you not be            
      satisfied unless your prey struggles?                                 
  ANN [turning to him as if to let him into a secret] Tavy will never       
      marry. Havnt you noticed that that sort of man never marries?         
  TANNER. What! a man who idolizes women! who sees nothing in nature        
      but romantic scenery for love duets! Tavy, the chivalrous, the        
      faithful, the tenderhearted and true! Tavy, never marry! Why, he      
      was born to be swept up by the first pair of blue eyes he meets       
      in the street.                                                        
  ANN. Yes, I know. All the same, Jack, men like that always live in        
      comfortable bachelor lodgings with broken hearts, and are adored      
      by their landladies, and never get married. Men like you always       
      get married.                                                          
  TANNER [smiting his brow] How frightfully, horribly true! It has          
      been staring me in the face all my life; and I never saw it           
      before.                                                               
  ANN. Oh, it's the same with women. The poetic temperament's a very        
      nice temperament, very amiable, very harmless and poetic, I           
      daresay; but it's an old maid's temperament.                          
  TANNER. Barren. The Life Force passes it by.                              
  ANN. If thats what you mean by the Life Force, yes.                       
  TANNER. You dont care for Tavy?                                           
  ANN [looking round carefully to make sure that Tavy is not within         
      earshot] No.                                                          
  TANNER. And you do care for me?                                           
  ANN [rising quietly and shaking her finger at him] Now, Jack! Behave      
      yourself.                                                             
  TANNER. Infamous, abandoned woman! Devil!                                 
  ANN. Boa-constrictor! Elephant!                                           
  TANNER. Hypocrite!                                                        
  ANN [softly] I must be, for my future husband's sake.                     
  TANNER. For mine! [Correcting himself savagely] I mean for his.           
  ANN [ignoring the correction] Yes, for yours. You had better marry        
      what you call a hypocrite, Jack. Women who are not hypocrites go      
      about in rational dress and are insulted and get into all sorts       
      of hot water. And then their husbands get dragged in too, and         
      live in continual dread of fresh complications. Wouldnt you           
      prefer a wife you could depend on?                                    
  TANNER. No: a thousand times no: hot water is the revolutionist's         
      element. You clean men as you clean milk-pails, by scalding           
      them.                                                                 
  ANN. Cold water has its uses too. It's healthy.                           
  TANNER [despairingly] Oh, you are witty: at the supreme moment the        
      Life Force endows you with every quality. Well, I too can be a        
      hypocrite. Your father's will appointed me your guardian, not         
      your suitor. I shall be faithful to my trust.                         
  ANN [in low siren tones] He asked me who I would have as my guardian      
      before he made that will. I chose you!                                
  TANNER. The will is yours then! The trap was laid from the                
      beginning.                                                            
  ANN [concentrating all her magic] From the beginning- from our            
      childhood- for both of us- by the Life Force.                         
  TANNER. I will not marry you. I will not marry you.                       
  ANN. Oh, you will, you will.                                              
  TANNER. I tell you, no, no, no.                                           
  ANN. I tell you, yes, yes, yes.                                           
  TANNER. No.                                                               
  ANN [coaxing- imploring- almost exhausted] Yes. Before it is too          
      late for repentance. Yes.                                             
  TANNER [struck by the echo from the past] When did all this happen        
      to me before? Are we two dreaming?                                    
  ANN [suddenly losing her courage, with an anguish that she does not       
      conceal] No. We are awake; and you have said no: that is all.         
  TANNER [brutally] Well?                                                   
  ANN. Well, I made a mistake: you do not love me.                          
  TANNER [seizing her in his arms] It is false: I love you. The Life        
      Force enchants me: I have the whole world in my arms when I           
      clasp you. But I am fighting for my freedom, for my honor, for        
      my self, one and indivisible.                                         
  ANN. Your happiness will be worth them all.                               
  TANNER. You would sell freedom and honor and self for happiness?          
  ANN. It will not be all happiness for me. Perhaps death.                  
  TANNER [groaning] Oh, that clutch holds and hurts. What have you          
      grasped in me? Is there a father's heart as well as a mother's?       
  ANN. Take care, Jack: if anyone comes while we are like this, you         
      will have to marry me.                                                
  TANNER. If we two stood now on the edge of a precipice, I would hold      
      you tight and jump.                                                   
  ANN [panting, failing more and more under the strain] Jack: let me        
      go. I have dared so frightfully- it is lasting longer than I          
      thought. Let me go: I cant bear it.                                   
  TANNER. Nor I. Let it kill us.                                            
  ANN. Yes: I dont care. I am at the end of my forces. I dont care. I       
      think I am going to faint.                                            

    At this moment Violet and Octavius come from the villa with Mrs         
Whitefield, who is wrapped up for driving. Simultaneously Malone and        
Ramsden, followed by Mendoza and Straker, come in through the little        
gate in the paling. Tanner shamefacedly releases Ann, who raises her        
hand giddily to her forehead.                                               

  MALONE. Take care. Something's the matter with the lady.                  
  RAMSDEN. What does this mean?                                             
  VIOLET [running between Ann and Tanner] Are you ill?                      
  ANN [reeling, with a supreme effort] I have promised to marry Jack.       
      [She swoons. Violet kneels by her and chafes her hand. Tanner         
      runs round to her other hand, and tries to lift her head.             
      Octavius goes to Violet's assistance, but does not know what to       
      do. Mrs Whitefield hurries back into the villa. Octavius,             
      Malone, and Ramsden run to Ann and crowd round her, stooping to       
      assist. Straker coolly comes to Ann's feet, and Mendoza to her        
      head, both upright and self-possessed].                               
  STRAKER. Now then, ladies and gentlemen: she dont want a crowd round      
      her: she wants air- all the air she can git. If you please,           
      gents- [Malone and Ramsden allow him to drive them gently past        
      Ann and up the lawn towards the garden, where Octavius, who has       
      already become conscious of his uselessness, joins them.              
      Straker, following them up, pauses for a moment to instruct           
      Tanner]. Dont lift er ed, Mr Tanner: let it go flat so's the          
      blood can run back into it.                                           
  MENDOZA. He is right, Mr. Tanner. Trust to the air of the Sierra.         
      [He withdraws delicately to the garden steps].                        
  TANNER [rising] I yield to your superior knowledge of physiology,         
      Henry. [He withdraws to the corner of the lawn; and Octavius          
      immediately hurries down to him].                                     
  TAVY [aside to Tanner, grasping his hand] Jack: be very happy.            
  TANNER [aside to Tavy] I never asked her. It is a trap for me. [He        
      goes up the lawn towards the garden. Octavius remains                 
      petrified].                                                           
  MENDOZA [intercepting Mrs Whitefield, who comes from the villa with       
      a glass of brandy] What is this, Madam [he takes it from her]?        
  MRS WHITEFIELD. A little brandy.                                          
  MENDOZA. The worst thing you could give her. Allow me. [He swallows       
      it]. Trust to the air of the Sierra, madam.                           

    For a moment the men all forget Ann and stare at Mendoza.               

  ANN [in Violet's ear, clutching her round the neck] Violet: did Jack      
      say anything when I fainted?                                          
  VIOLET. No.                                                               
  ANN. Ah! [with a sigh of intense relief she relapses].                    
  MRS WHITEFIELD. Oh, she's fainted again.                                  

    They are about to rush back to her; but Mendoza stops them with         
a warning gesture.                                                          

  ANN [supine] No, I havnt. I'm quite happy.                                
  TANNER [suddenly walking determinedly to her, and snatching her hand      
      from Violet to feel her pulse] Why, her pulse is positively           
      bounding. Come! get up. What nonsense! Up with you. [He hauls         
      her up summarily].                                                    
  ANN. Yes: I feel strong enough now. But you very nearly killed me,        
      Jack, for all that.                                                   
  MALONE. A rough wooer, eh? Theyre the best sort, Miss Whitefield. I       
      congratulate Mr Tanner; and I hope to meet you and him as             
      frequent guests at the abbey.                                         
  ANN. Thank you. [She goes past Malone to Octavius] Ricky Ticky Tavy:      
      congratulate me. [Aside to him] I want to make you cry for the        
      last time.                                                            
  TAVY [steadfastly] No more tears. I am happy in your happiness. And       
      I believe in you in spite of everything.                              
  RAMSDEN [coming between Malone and Tanner] You are a happy man, Jack      
      Tanner. I envy you.                                                   
  MENDOZA [advancing between Violet and Tanner] Sir: there are two          
      tragedies in life. One is to lose your heart's desire. The other      
      is to gain it. Mine and yours, sir.                                   
  TANNER. Mr Mendoza: I have no heart's desires. Ramsden: it is very        
      easy for you to call me a happy man: you are only a spectator. I      
      am one of the principals; and I know better. Ann: stop tempting       
      Tavy, and come back to me.                                            
  ANN [complying] You are absurd, Jack. [She takes his proffered arm].      
  TANNER [continuing] I solemnly say that I am not a happy man. Ann         
      looks happy; but she is only triumphant, successful, victorious.      
      That is not happiness, but the price for which the strong sell        
      their happiness. What we have both done this afternoon is to          
      renounce happiness, renounce freedom, renounce tranquillity,          
      above all, renounce the romantic possibilities of an unknown          
      future, for the cares of a household and a family. I beg that         
      no man may seize the occasion to get half drunk and utter             
      imbecile speeches and coarse pleasantries at my expense. We           
      propose to furnish our own house according to our own taste; and      
      I hereby give notice that the seven or eight travelling clocks,       
      the four or five dressing cases, the carvers and fish slices,         
      the copies of Patmore's Angel In The House in extra morocco, and      
      the other articles you are preparing to heap upon us, will be         
      instantly sold, and the proceeds devoted to circulating free          
      copies of the Revolutionist's Handbook. The wedding will take         
      place three days after our return to England, by special              
      licence, at the office of the district superintendent registrar,      
      in the presence of my solicitor and his clerk, who, like his          
      clients, will be in ordinary walking dress-                           
  VIOLET [with intense conviction] You are a brute, Jack.                   
  ANN [looking at him with fond pride and caressing his arm] Never          
      mind her, dear. Go on talking.                                        
  TANNER. Talking!                                                          

    Universal laughter.                                                     


                                                                            
                                                                            
          THE REVOLUTIONIST'S HANDBOOK AND POCKET COMPANION
                                  BY  
                        JOHN TANNER, M.I.R.C.
                   (Member of the Idle Rich Class)                          
                                                                            

               PREFACE TO THE REVOLUTIONIST'S HANDBOOK

  "No one can contemplate the present condition of the masses of the        
people without desiring something like a revolution for the better."        
Sir Robert Giffen. Essays in Finance, vol. ii. p. 393.                      


                               FOREWORD                                     

  A REVOLUTIONIST is one who desires to discard the existing social         
order and try another.                                                      
  The constitution of England is revolutionary. To a Russian or             
Anglo-Indian bureaucrat, a general election is as much a revolution as      
a referendum or plebiscite in which the people fight instead of             
voting. The French Revolution overthrew one set of rulers and               
substituted another with different interests and different views. That      
is what a general election enables the people to do in England every        
seven years if they choose. Revolution is therefore a national              
institution in England; and its advocacy by an Englishman needs no          
apology.                                                                    
  Every man is a revolutionist concerning the thing he understands.         
For example, every person who has mastered a profession is a sceptic        
concerning it, and consequently a revolutionist.                            
  Every genuine religious person is a heretic and therefore a               
revolutionist.                                                              
  All who achieve real distinction in life begin as revolutionists.         
The most distinguished persons become more revolutionary as they            
grow older, though they are commonly supposed to become more                
conservative owing to their loss of faith in conventional methods of        
reform.                                                                     
  Any person under the age of thirty, who, having any knowledge of the      
existing social order, is not a revolutionist, is an inferior.              
  AND YET                                                                   
  Revolutions have never lightened the burden of tyranny: they have         
only shifted it to another shoulder.                                        
                                                     JOHN TANNER            


                                   I
                           ON GOOD BREEDING                                 

  IF there were no God, said the eighteenth century Deist, it would be      
necessary to invent Him. Now this XVIII century god was deus ex            
machina, the god who helped those who could not help themselves,           
the god of the lazy and incapable. The nineteenth century decided that      
there is indeed no such god; and now Man must take in hand all the          
work that he used to shirk with an idle prayer. He must, in effect,         
change himself into the political Providence which he formerly              
conceived as god; and such change is not only possible, but the only        
sort of change that is real. The mere transfiguration of institutions,      
as from military and priestly dominance to commercial and scientific        
dominance, from commercial dominance to proletarian democracy, from         
slavery to serfdom, from serfdom to capitalism, from monarchy to            
republicanism, from polytheism to monotheism, from monotheism to            
atheism, from atheism to pantheistic humanitarianism, from general          
illiteracy to general literacy, from romance to realism, from               
realism to mysticism, from metaphysics to physics, are all but changes      
from Tweedledum to Tweedledee: plus ca change, plus c'est la meme          
chose. But the changes from the crab apple to the pippin, from the         
wolf and fox to the house dog, from the charger of Henry V to the           
brewer's draught horse and the race-horse, are real; for here Man           
has played the god, subduing Nature to his intention, and ennobling or      
debasing Life for a set purpose. And what can be done with a wolf           
can be done with a man. If such monsters as the tramp and the               
gentleman can appear as mere by-products of Man's individual greed and      
folly, what might we not hope for as a main product of his universal        
aspiration?                                                                 
  This is no new conclusion. The despair of institutions, and the           
inexorable "ye must be born again," with Mrs Poyser's stipulation,          
"and born different," recurs in every generation. The cry for the           
Superman did not begin with Nietzsche, nor will it end with his vogue.      
But it has always been silenced by the same question: what kind of          
person is this Superman to be? You ask, not for a super-apple, but for      
an eatable apple; not for a superhorse, but for a horse of greater          
draught or velocity. Neither is it of any use to ask for a Superman:        
you must furnish a specification of the sort of man you want.               
Unfortunately you do not know what sort of man you want. Some sort          
of goodlooking philosopher-athlete, with a handsome healthy woman           
for his mate, perhaps.                                                      
  Vague as this is, it is a great advance on the popular demand for         
a perfect gentleman and a perfect lady. And, after all, no market           
demand in the world takes the form of exact technical specification of      
the article required. Excellent poultry and potatoes are produced to        
satisfy the demand of housewives who do not know the technical              
differences between a tuber and a chicken. They will tell you that the      
proof of the pudding is in the eating; and they are right. The proof        
of the Superman will be in the living; and we shall find out how to         
produce him by the old method of trial and error, and not by waiting        
for a completely convincing prescription of his ingredients.                
  Certain common and obvious mistakes may be ruled out from the             
beginning. For example, we agree that we want superior mind; but we         
need not fall into the football club folly of counting on this as a         
product of superior body. Yet if we recoil so far as to conclude            
that superior mind consists in being the dupe of our ethical                
classifications of virtues and vices, in short, of conventional             
morality, we shall fall out of the fryingpan of the football club into      
the fire of the Sunday School. If we must choose between a race of          
athletes and a race of "good" men, let us have the athletes: better         
Samson and Milo than Calvin and Robespierre. But neither alternative        
is worth changing for: Samson is no more a Superman than Calvin.            
What then are we to do?                                                     


                                  II                                        
                        PROPERTY AND MARRIAGE                               

  LET us hurry over the obstacles set up by property and marriage.          
Revolutionists make too much of them. No doubt it is easy to                
demonstrate that property will destroy society unless society destroys      
it. No doubt, also, property has hitherto held its own and destroyed        
all the empires. But that was because the superficial objection to          
it (that it distributes social wealth and the social labor burden in a      
grotesquely inequitable manner) did not threaten the existence of           
the race, but only the individual happiness of its units, and               
finally the maintenance of some irrelevant political form or other,         
such as a nation, an empire, or the like. Now as happiness never            
matters to Nature, as she neither recognizes flags and frontiers nor        
cares a straw whether the economic system adopted by a society is           
feudal, capitalistic, or collectivist, provided it keeps the race           
afoot (the hive and the anthill being as acceptable to her as Utopia),      
the demonstrations of Socialists, though irrefutable, will never            
make any serious impression on property. The knell of that                  
over-rated institution will not sound until it is felt to conflict          
with some more vital matter than mere personal inequities in                
industrial economy. No such conflict was perceived whilst society           
had not yet grown beyond national communities too small and simple          
to overtax Man's limited political capacity disastrously. But we            
have now reached the stage of international organization. Man's             
political capacity and magnanimity are clearly beaten by the                
vastness and complexity of the problems forced on him. And it is at         
this anxious moment that he finds, when he looks upward for a mightier      
mind to help him, that the heavens are empty. He will presently see         
that his discarded formula that Man is the Temple of the Holy Ghost         
happens to be precisely true, and that it is only through his own           
brain and hand that this Holy Ghost, formally the most nebulous person      
in the Trinity, and now become its sole survivor as it has always been      
its real Unity, can help him in any way. And so, if the Superman is to      
come, he must be born of Woman by Man's intentional and                     
well-considered contrivance. Conviction of this will smash                  
everything that opposes it. Even Property and Marriage, which laugh at      
the laborer's petty complaint that he is defrauded of "surplus value,"      
and at the domestic miseries of the slaves of the wedding ring, will        
themselves be laughed aside as the lightest of trifles if they cross        
this conception when it becomes a fully realized vital purpose of           
the race.                                                                   
  That they must cross it becomes obvious the moment we acknowledge         
the futility of breeding men for special qualities as we breed cocks        
for game, greyhounds for speed, or sheep for mutton. What is really         
important in Man is the part of him that we do not yet understand.          
Of much of it we are not even conscious, just as we are not normally        
conscious of keeping up our circulation by our heart-pump, though if        
we neglect it we die. We are therefore driven to the conclusion that        
when we have carried selection as far as we can by rejecting from           
the list of eligible parents all persons who are uninteresting,             
unpromising, or blemished without any set-off, we shall still have          
to trust to the guidance of fancy (alias Voice of Nature), both in        
the breeders and the parents, for that superiority in the                   
unconscious self which will be the true characteristic of the               
Superman.                                                                   
  At this point we perceive the importance of giving fancy the              
widest possible field. To cut humanity up into small cliques, and           
effectively limit the selection of the individual to his own clique,        
is to postpone the Superman for eons, if not for ever. Not only should      
every person be nourished and trained as a possible parent, but             
there should be no possibility of such an obstacle to natural               
selection as the objection of a countess to a navvy or of a duke to         
a charwoman. Equality is essential to good breeding; and equality,          
as all economists know, is incompatible with property.                      
  Besides, equality is an essential condition of bad breeding also;         
and bad breeding is indispensable to the weeding out of the human           
race. When the conception of heredity took hold of the scientific           
imagination in the middle of last century, its devotees announced that      
it was a crime to marry the lunatic to the lunatic or the                   
consumptive to the consumptive. But pray are we to try to correct           
our diseased stocks by infecting our healthy stocks with them? Clearly      
the attraction which disease has for diseased people is beneficial          
to the race. If two really unhealthy people get married, they will, as      
likely as not, have a great number of children who will all die before      
they reach maturity. This is a far more satisfactory arrangement            
than the tragedy of a union between a healthy and an unhealthy person.      
Though more costly than sterilization of the unhealthy, it has the          
enormous advantage that in the event of our notions of health and           
unhealth being erroneous (which to some extent they most certainly          
are), the error will be corrected by experience instead of confirmed        
by evasion.                                                                 
  One fact must be faced resolutely, in spite of the shrieks of the         
romantic. There is no evidence that the best citizens are the               
offspring of congenial marriages, or that a conflict of temperament is      
not a highly important part of what breeders call crossing. On the          
contrary, it is quite sufficiently probable that good results may be        
obtained from parents who would be extremely unsuitable companions and      
partners, to make it certain that the experiment of mating them will        
sooner or later be tried purposely almost as often as it is now             
tried accidentally. But mating such couples must clearly not involve        
marrying them. In conjugation two complementary persons may supply one      
another's deficiencies: in the domestic partnership of marriage they        
only feel them and suffer from them. Thus the son of a robust,              
cheerful, eupeptic British country squire, with the tastes and range        
of his class, and of a clever, imaginative, intellectual, highly            
civilized Jewess, might be very superior to both his parents; but it        
is not likely that the Jewess would find the squire an interesting          
companion, or his habits, his friends, his place and mode of life           
congenial to her. Therefore marriage, whilst it is made an                  
indispensable condition of mating, will delay the advent of the             
Superman as effectually as Property, and will be modified by the            
impulse towards him just as effectually.                                    
  The practical abrogation of Property and Marriage as they exist at        
present will occur without being much noticed. To the mass of men, the      
intelligent abolition of property would mean nothing except an              
increase in the quantity of food, clothing, housing, and comfort at         
their personal disposal, as well as a greater control over their            
time and circumstances. Very few persons now make any distinction           
between virtually complete property and property held on such highly        
developed public conditions as to place its income on the same footing      
as that of a propertyless clergyman, officer, or civil servant. A           
landed proprietor may still drive men and women off his land, demolish      
their dwellings, and replace them with sheep or deer; and in the            
unregulated trades the private trader may still spunge on the               
regulated trades and sacrifice the life and health of the nation as         
lawlessly as the Manchester cotton manufacturers did at the                 
beginning of last century. But though the Factory Code on the one           
hand, and Trade Union organization on the other, have, within the           
lifetime of men still living, converted the old unrestricted                
property of the cotton manufacturer in his mill and the cotton spinner      
in his labor into a mere permission to trade or work on stringent           
public or collective conditions, imposed in the interest of the             
general welfare without any regard for individual hard cases, people        
in Lancashire still speak of their "property" in the old terms,             
meaning nothing more by it than the things a thief can be punished for      
stealing. The total abolition of property, and the conversion of every      
citizen into a salaried functionary in the public service, would leave      
much more than 99 per cent of the nation quite unconscious of any           
greater change than now takes place when the son of a shipowner goes        
into the navy. They would still call their watches and umbrellas and        
back gardens their property.                                                
  Marriage also will persist as a name attached to a general custom         
long after the custom itself will have altered. For example, modern         
English marriage, as modified by divorce and by Married Women's             
Property Acts, differs more from early XIX century marriage than            
Byron's marriage did from Shakespear's. At the present moment marriage      
in England differs not only from marriage in France, but from marriage      
in Scotland. Marriage as modified by the divorce laws in South              
Dakota would be called mere promiscuity in Clapham. Yet the Americans,      
far from taking a profligate and cynical view of marriage, do homage        
to its ideals with a seriousness that seems old fashioned in                
Clapham. Neither in England nor America would a proposal to abolish         
marriage be tolerated for a moment; and yet nothing is more certain         
than that in both countries the progressive modification of the             
marriage contract will be continued until it is no more onerous nor         
irrevocable than any ordinary commercial deed of partnership. Were          
even this dispensed with, people would still call themselves                
husbands and wives; describe their companionships as marriages; and be      
for the most part unconscious that they were any less married than          
Henry VIII. For though a glance at the legal conditions of marriage in      
different Christian countries shews that marriage varies legally            
from frontier to frontier, domesticity varies so little that most           
people believe their own marriage laws to be universal. Consequently        
here again, as in the case of Property, the absolute confidence of the      
public in the stability of the institution's name, makes it all the         
easier to alter its substance.                                              
  However, it cannot be denied that one of the changes in public            
opinion demanded by the need for the Superman is a very unexpected          
one. It is nothing less than the dissolution of the present                 
necessary association of marriage with conjugation, which most              
unmarried people regard as the very diagnostic of marriage. They are        
wrong, of course: it would be quite as near the truth to say that           
conjugation is the one purely accidental and incidental condition of        
marriage. Conjugation is essential to nothing but the propagation of        
the race; and the moment that paramount need is provided for otherwise      
than by marriage, conjugation, from Nature's creative point of view,        
ceases to be essential in marriage. But marriage does not thereupon         
cease to be so economical, convenient, and comfortable, that the            
Superman might safely bribe the matrimonomaniacs by offering to revive      
all the old inhuman stringency and irrevocability of marriage, to           
abolish divorce, to confirm the horrible bond which still chains            
decent people to drunkards, criminals, and wasters, provided only           
the complete extrication of conjugation from it were conceded to            
him. For if people could form domestic companionships on no easier          
terms than these, they would still marry. The Roman Catholic,               
forbidden by his Church to avail himself of the divorce laws,               
marries as freely as the South Dakotan Presbyterians who can change         
partners with a facility that scandalizes the old world; and were           
his Church to dare a further step towards Christianity and enjoin           
celibacy on its laity as well as on its clergy, marriages would             
still be contracted for the sake of domesticity by perfectly                
obedient sons and daughters of the Church. One need not further pursue      
these hypotheses: they are only suggested here to help the reader to        
analyse marriage into its two functions of regulating conjugation           
and supplying a form of domesticity. These two functions are quite          
separable; and domesticity is the only one of the two which is              
essential to the existence of marriage, because conjugation without         
domesticity is not marriage at all, whereas domesticity without             
conjugation is still marriage: in fact it is necessarily the actual         
condition of all fertile marriages during a great part of their             
duration, and of some marriages during the whole of it.                     
  Taking it, then, that Property and Marriage, by destroying                
Equality and thus hampering sexual selection with irrelevant                
conditions, are hostile to the evolution of the Superman, it is easy        
to understand why the only generally known modern experiment in             
breeding the human race took place in a community which discarded both      
institutions.                                                               


                                 III                                        
             THE PERFECTIONIST EXPERIMENT AT ONEIDA CREEK                   

  IN 1848 the Oneida Community was founded in America to carry out a        
resolution arrived at by a handful of Perfectionist Communists "that        
we will devote ourselves exclusively to the establishment of the            
Kingdom of God." Though the American nation declared that this sort of      
thing was not to be tolerated in a Christian country, the Oneida            
Community held its own for over thirty years, during which period it        
seems to have produced healthier children and done and suffered less        
evil than any Joint Stock Company on record. It was, however, a highly      
selected community; for a genuine communist (roughly definable as an        
intensely proud person who proposes to enrich the common fund               
instead of to spunge on it) is superior to an ordinary joint stock          
capitalist precisely as an ordinary joint stock capitalist is superior      
to a pirate. Further, the Perfectionists were mightily shepherded by        
their chief Noyes, one of those chance attempts at the Superman             
which occur from time to time in spite of the interference of Man's         
blundering institutions. The existence of Noyes simplified the              
breeding problem for the Communists, the question as to what sort of        
man they should strive to breed being settled at once by the obvious        
desirability of breeding another Noyes.                                     
  But an experiment conducted by a handful of people, who, after            
thirty years of immunity from the unintentional child slaughter that        
goes on by ignorant parents in private homes, numbered only 300, could      
do very little except prove that Communists, under the guidance of a        
Superman "devoted exclusively to the establishment of the Kingdom of        
God," and caring no more for property and marriage than a Camberwell        
minister cares for Hindoo Caste or Suttee, might make a much better         
job of their lives than ordinary folk under the harrow of both these        
institutions. Yet their Superman himself admitted that this apparent        
success was only part of the abnormal phenomenon of his own                 
occurrence; for when he came to the end of his powers through age,          
he himself guided and organized the voluntary relapse of the                
communists into marriage, capitalism, and customary private life, thus      
admitting that the real social solution was not what a casual Superman      
could persuade a picked company to do for him, but what a whole             
community of Supermen would do spontaneously. If Noyes had had to           
organize, not a few dozen Perfectionists, but the whole United States,      
America would have beaten him as completely as England beat Oliver          
Cromwell, France Napoleon, or Rome Julius Caesar. Cromwell learnt by        
bitter experience that God himself cannot raise a people above its own      
level, and that even though you stir a nation to sacrifice all its          
appetites to its conscience, the result will still depend wholly on         
what sort of conscience the nation has got. Napoleon seems to have          
ended by regarding mankind as a troublesome pack of hounds only             
worth keeping for the sport of hunting with them. Caesar's capacity         
for fighting without hatred or resentment was defeated by the               
determination of his soldiers to kill their enemies in the field            
instead of taking them prisoners to be spared by Caesar; and his civil      
supremacy was purchased by colossal bribery of the citizens of Rome.        
What great rulers cannot do, codes and religions cannot do. Man             
reads his own nature into every ordinance: if you devise a                  
superhuman commandment so cunningly that it cannot be misinterpreted        
in terms of his will, he will denounce it as seditious blasphemy, or        
else disregard it as either crazy or totally unintelligible.                
Parliaments and synods may tinker as much as they please with their         
codes and creeds as circumstances alter the balance of classes and          
their interests; and, as a result of the tinkering, there may be an         
occasional illusion of moral evolution, as when the victory of the          
commercial caste over the military caste leads to the substitution          
of social boycotting and pecuniary damages for duelling. At certain         
moments there may even be a considerable material advance, as when the      
conquest of political power by the working class produces a better          
distribution of wealth through the simple action of the selfishness of      
the new masters; but all this is mere readjustment and reformation:         
until the heart and mind of the people is changed the very greatest         
man will no more dare to govern on the assumption that all are as           
great as he than a drover dare leave his flock to find its way through      
the streets as he himself would. Until there is an England in which         
every man is a Cromwell, a France in which every man is a Napoleon,         
a Rome in which every man is a Caesar, a Germany in which every man is      
a Luther plus a Goethe, the world will be no more improved by its           
heroes than a Brixton villa is improved by the pyramid of Cheops.           
The production of such nations is the only real change possible to us.      


                                  IV                                        
                MAN'S OBJECTION TO HIS OWN IMPROVEMENT                      

  BUT would such a change be tolerated if Man must rise above               
himself to desire it? It would, through his misconception of its            
nature. Man does desire an ideal Superman with such energy as he can        
spare from his nutrition, and has in every age magnified the best           
living substitute for it he can find. His least incompetent general is      
set up as an Alexander; his king is the first gentleman in the              
world; his Pope is a saint. He is never without an array of human           
idols who are all nothing but sham Supermen. That the real Superman         
will snap his superfingers at all Man's present trumpery ideals of          
right, duty, honor, justice, religion, even decency, and accept             
moral obligations beyond present human endurance, is a thing that           
contemporary Man does not foresee: in fact he does not notice it            
when our casual Supermen do it in his very face. He actually does it        
himself every day without knowing it. He will therefore make no             
objection to the production of a race of what he calls Great Men or         
Heroes, because he will imagine them, not as true Supermen, but as          
himself endowed with infinite brains, infinite courage, and infinite        
money.                                                                      
  The most troublesome opposition will arise from the general fear          
of mankind that any interference with our conjugal customs will be          
an interference with our pleasures and our romance. This fear, by           
putting on airs of offended morality, has always intimidated people         
who have not measured its essential weakness; but it will prevail with      
those degenerates only in whom the instinct of fertility has faded          
into a mere itching for pleasure. The modern devices for combining          
pleasure with sterility, now universally known and accessible,              
enable these persons to weed themselves out of the race, a process          
already vigorously at work; and the consequent survival of the              
intelligently fertile means the survival of the partizans of the            
Superman; for what is proposed is nothing but the replacement of the        
old unintelligent, inevitable, almost unconscious fertility by an           
intelligently controlled, conscious fertility, and the elimination          
of the mere voluptuary from the evolutionary process. * Even if this        
selective agency had not been invented, the purpose of the race             
would still shatter the opposition of individual instincts. Not only        
do the bees and the ants satisfy their reproductive and parental            
instincts vicariously; but marriage itself successfully imposes             
celibacy on millions of unmarried normal men and women. In short,           
the individual instinct in this matter, overwhelming as it is               
thoughtlessly supposed to be, is really a finally negligible one.           
-                                                                           
  * The part played in evolution by the voluptuary will be the same as      
that already played by the glutton. The glutton, as the man with the        
strongest motive for nourishing himself, will always take more pains        
than his fellows to get food. When food is so difficult to get that         
only great exertions can secure a sufficient supply of it, the              
glutton's appetite develops his cunning and enterprise to the               
utmost; and he becomes not only the best fed but the ablest man in the      
community. But in more hospitable climates, or where the social             
organization of the food supply makes it easy for a man to overeat,         
then the glutton eats himself out of health and finally out of              
existence. All other voluptuaries prosper and perish in the same            
way; way; and this is why the survival of the fittest means finally         
the survival of the self-controlled, because they alone can adapt           
themselves to the perpetual shifting of conditions produced by              
industrial progress.                                                        


                                  V                                         
                 THE POLITICAL NEED FOR THE SUPERMAN                        

  THE need for the Superman is, in its most imperative aspect, a            
political one. We have been driven to Proletarian Democracy by the          
failure of all the alternative systems; for these depended on the           
existence of Supermen acting as despots or oligarchs; and not only          
were these Supermen not always or even often forthcoming at the             
right moment and in an eligible social position, but when they were         
forthcoming they could not, except for a short time and by morally          
suicidal coercive methods, impose superhumanity on those whom they          
governed; so, by mere force of "human nature," government by consent        
of the governed has supplanted the old plan of governing the citizen        
as a public-schoolboy is governed.                                          
  Now we have yet to see the man who, having any practical                  
experience of Proletarian Democracy, has any belief in its capacity         
for solving great political problems, or even for doing ordinary            
parochial work intelligently and economically. Only under despotisms        
and oligarchies has the Radical faith in "universal suffrage" as a          
political panacea arisen. It withers the moment it is exposed to            
practical trial, because Democracy cannot rise above the level of           
the human material of which its voters are made. Switzerland seems          
happy in comparison with Russia; but if Russia were as small as             
Switzerland, and had her social problems simplified in the same way by      
impregnable natural fortifications and a population educated by the         
same variety and intimacy of international intercourse, there might be      
little to choose between them. At all events Australia and Canada,          
which are virtually protected democratic republics, and France and the      
United States, which are avowedly independent democratic republics,         
are neither healthy, wealthy, nor wise; and they would be worse             
instead of better if their popular ministers were not experts in the        
art of dodging popular enthusiasms and duping popular ignorance. The        
politician who once had to learn how to flatter Kings has now to learn      
how to fascinate, amuse, coax, humbug, frighten, or otherwise strike        
the fancy of the electorate; and though in advanced modern States,          
where the artizan is better educated than the King, it takes a much         
bigger man to be a successful demagogue than to be a successful             
courtier, yet he who holds popular convictions with prodigious              
energy is the man for the mob, whilst the frailer sceptic who is            
cautiously feeling his way towards the next century has no chance           
unless he happens by accident to have the specific artistic talent          
of the mountebank as well, in which case it is as a mountebank that he      
catches votes, and not as a meliorist. Consequently the demagogue,          
though he professes (and fails) to readjust matters in the interests        
of the majority of the electors, yet stereotypes mediocrity, organizes      
intolerance, disparages exhibitions of uncommon qualities, and              
glorifies conspicuous exhibitions of common ones. He manages a small        
job well: he muddles rhetorically through a large one. When a great         
political movement takes place, it is not consciously led nor               
organized: the unconscious self in mankind breaks its way through           
the problem as an elephant breaks through a jungle; and the                 
politicians make speeches about whatever happens in the process,            
which, with the best intentions, they do all in their power to              
prevent. Finally, when social aggregation arrives at a point demanding      
international organization before the demagogues and electorates            
have learnt how to manage even a country parish properly much less          
internationalize Constantinople, the whole political business goes          
to smash; and presently we have Ruins of Empires, New Zealanders            
sitting on a broken arch of London Bridge, and so forth.                    
  To that recurrent catastrophe we shall certainly come again unless        
we can have a Democracy of Supermen; and the production of such a           
Democracy is the only change that is now hopeful enough to nerve us to      
the effort that Revolution demands.

                          PRUDERY EXPLAINED                                 

  WHY the bees should pamper their mothers whilst we pamper only our        
operatic prima donnas is a question worth reflecting on. Our notion of      
treating a mother is, not to increase her supply of food, but to cut        
it off by forbidding her to work in a factory for a month after her         
confinement. Everything that can make birth a misfortune to the             
parents as well as a danger to the mother is conscientiously done.          
When a great French writer, Emil Zola, alarmed at the sterilization of      
his nation, wrote an eloquent and powerful book to restore the              
prestige of parentage, it was at once assumed in England that a work        
of this character, with such a title as Fecundity, was too                  
abominable to be translated, and that any attempt to deal with the          
relations of the sexes from any other than the voluptuary or                
romantic point of view must be sternly put down. Now if this                
assumption were really founded on public opinion, it would indicate an      
attitude of disgust and resentment towards the Life Force that could        
only arise in a diseased and moribund community in which Ibsen's Hedda      
Gabler would be the typical woman. But it has no vital foundation at        
all. The prudery of the newspapers is, like the prudery of the              
dinner table, a mere difficulty of education and language. We are           
not taught to think decently on these subjects, and consequently we         
have no language for them except indecent language. We therefore            
have to declare them unfit for public discussion, because the only          
terms in which we can conduct the discussion are unfit for public use.      
Physiologists, who have a technical vocabulary at their disposal, find      
no difficulty; and masters of language who think decently can write         
popular stories like Zola's Fecundity or Tolstoy's Resurrection             
without giving the smallest offence to readers who can also think           
decently. But the ordinary modern journalist, who has never                 
discussed such matters except in ribaldry, cannot write a simple            
comment on a divorce case without a conscious shamefulness or a             
furtive facetiousness that makes it impossible to read the comment          
aloud in company. All this ribaldry and prudery (the two are the same)      
does not mean that people do not feel decently on the subject: on           
the contrary, it is just the depth and seriousness of our feeling that      
makes its desecration by vile language and coarse humor intolerable;        
so that at last we cannot bear to have it spoken of at all because          
only one in a thousand can speak of it without wounding our                 
self-respect, especially the self-respect of women. Add to the horrors      
of popular language the horrors of popular poverty. In crowded              
populations poverty destroys the possibility of cleanliness; and in         
the absence of cleanliness many of the natural conditions of life           
become offensive and noxious, with the result that at last the              
association of uncleanliness with these natural conditions becomes          
so overpowering that among civilized people (that is, people massed in      
the labyrinths of slums we call cities), half their bodily life             
becomes a guilty secret, unmentionable except to the doctor in              
emergencies; and Hedda Gabler shoots herself because maternity is so        
unladylike. In short, popular prudery is only a mere incident of            
popular squalor: the subjects which it taboos remain the most               
interesting and earnest of subjects in spite of it.                         


                                 VII                                        
                         PROGRESS AN ILLUSION                               

  UNFORTUNATELY the earnest people get drawn off the track of               
evolution by the illusion of progress.                                      
  Any Socialist can convince us easily that the difference between Man      
as he is and Man as he might become, without further evolution,             
under millennial conditions of nutrition, environment, and training,        
is enormous. He can shew that inequality and iniquitous distribution        
of wealth and allotment of labor have arisen through an unscientific        
economic system, and that Man, faulty as he is, no more intended to         
establish any such ordered disorder than a moth intends to be burnt         
when it flies into a candle flame. He can shew that the difference          
between the grace and strength of the acrobat and the bent back of the      
rheumatic field laborer is a difference produced by conditions, not by      
nature. He can shew that many of the most detestable human vices are        
not radical, but are mere reactions of our institutions on our very         
virtues. The Anarchist, the Fabian, the Salvationist, the                   
Vegetarian, the doctor, the lawyer, the parson, the professor of            
ethics, the gymnast, the soldier, the sportsman, the inventor, the          
political program-maker, all have some prescription for bettering           
us; and almost all their remedies are physically possible and aimed at      
admitted evils. To them the limit of progress is, at worst, the             
completion of all the suggested reforms and the levelling up of all         
men to the point attained already by the most highly nourished and          
cultivated in mind and body.                                                
  Here, then, as it seems to them, is an enormous field for the energy      
of the reformer. Here are many noble goals attainable by many of those      
paths up the Hill Difficulty along which great spirits love to aspire.      
Unhappily, the hill will never be climbed by Man as we know him. It         
need not be denied that if we all struggled bravely to the end of           
the reformers' paths we should improve the world prodigiously. But          
there is no more hope in that If than in the equally plausible              
assurance that if the sky falls we shall all catch larks. We are not        
going to tread those paths: we have not sufficient energy. We do not        
desire the end enough: indeed in more cases we do not effectively           
desire it at all. Ask any man would he like to be a better man; and he      
will say yes, most piously. Ask him would he like to have a million of      
money; and he will say yes, most sincerely. But the pious citizen           
who would like to be a better man goes on behaving just as he did           
before. And the tramp who would like the million does not take the          
trouble to earn ten shillings: multitudes of men and women, all             
eager to accept a legacy of a million, live and die without having          
ever possessed five pounds at one time, although beggars have died          
in rags on mattresses stuffed with gold which they accumulated because      
they desired it enough to nerve them to get it and keep it. The             
economists who discovered that demand created supply soon had to limit      
the proposition to "effective demand," which turned out, in the             
final analysis, to mean nothing more than supply itself; and this           
holds good in politics, morals, and all other departments as well: the      
actual supply is the measure of the effective demand; and the mere          
aspirations and professions produce nothing. No community has ever yet      
passed beyond the initial phases in which its pugnacity and fanaticism      
enabled it to found a nation, and its cupidity to establish and             
develop a commercial civilization. Even these stages have never been        
attained by public spirit, but always by intolerant wilfulness and          
brute force. Take the Reform Bill of 1832 as an example of a                
conflict between two sections of educated Englishmen concerning a           
political measure which was as obviously necessary and inevitable as        
any political measure has ever been or is ever likely to be. It was         
not passed until the gentlemen of Birmingham had made arrangements          
to cut the throats of the gentlemen of St. James's parish in due            
military form. It would not have been passed to this day if there           
had been no force behind it except the logic and public conscience          
of the Utilitarians. A despotic ruler with as much sense as Queen           
Elizabeth would have done better than the mob of grown-up Eton boys         
who governed us then by privilege, and who, since the introduction          
of practically Manhood Suffrage in 1884, now govern us at the               
request of proletarian Democracy.                                           
  At the present time we have, instead of the Utilitarians, the Fabian      
Society, with its peaceful, constitutional, moral, economical policy        
of Socialism, which needs nothing for its bloodless and benevolent          
realization except that the English people shall understand it and          
approve of it. But why are the Fabians well spoken of in circles where      
thirty years ago the word Socialist was understood as equivalent to         
cut-throat and incendiary? Not because the English have the smallest        
intention of studying or adopting the Fabian policy, but because            
they believe that the Fabians, by eliminating the element of                
intimidation from the Socialist agitation, have drawn the teeth of          
insurgent poverty and saved the existing order from the only method of      
attack it really fears. Of course, if the nation adopted the Fabian         
policy, it would be carried out by brute force exactly as our               
present property system is. It would become the law; and those who          
resisted it would be fined, sold up, knocked on the head by policemen,      
thrown into prison, and in the last resort "executed" just as they are      
when they break the present law. But as our proprietary class has no        
fear of that conversion taking place, whereas it does fear sporadic         
cut-throats and gunpowder plots, and strives with all its might to          
hide the fact that there is no moral difference whatever between the        
methods by which it enforces its proprietary rights and the method          
by which the dynamitard asserts his conception of natural human             
rights, the Fabian Society is patted on the back just as the Christian      
Social Union is, whilst the Socialist who says bluntly that a Social        
revolution can be made only as all other revolutions have been made,        
by the people who want it killing, coercing, and intimidating the           
people who dont want it, is denounced as a misleader of the people,         
and imprisoned with hard labor to shew him how much sincerity there is      
in the objection of his captors to physical force.                          
  Are we then to repudiate Fabian methods, and return to those of           
the barricader, or adopt those of the dynamitard and the assassin?          
On the contrary, we are to recognize that both are fundamentally            
futile. It seems easy for the dynamitard to say "Have you not just          
admitted that nothing is ever conceded except to physical force? Did        
not Gladstone admit that the Irish Church was disestablished, not by        
the spirit of Liberalism, but by the explosion which wrecked                
Clerkenwell prison?" Well, we need not foolishly and timidly deny           
it. Let it be fully granted. Let us grant, further, that all this lies      
in the nature of things; that the most ardent Socialist, if he owns         
property, can by no means do otherwise than Conservative proprietors        
until property is forcibly abolished by the whole nation; nay, that         
ballots, and parliamentary divisions, in spite of their vain ceremony,      
of discussion, differ from battles only as the bloodless surrender          
of an outnumbered force in the field differs from Waterloo or               
Trafalgar. I make a present of all these admissions to the Fenian           
who collects money from thoughtless Irishmen in America to blow up          
Dublin Castle; to the detective who persuades foolish young workmen to      
order bombs from the nearest ironmonger and then delivers them up to        
penal servitude; to our military and naval commanders who believe, not      
in preaching, but in an ultimatum backed by plenty of lyddite; and,         
generally, to all whom it may concern. But of what use is it to             
substitute the way of the reckless and bloodyminded for the way of the      
cautious and humane? Is England any the better for the wreck of             
Clerkenwell prison, or Ireland for the disestablishment of the Irish        
Church? Is there the smallest reason to suppose that the nation             
which sheepishly let Charles and Laud and Strafford coerce it,              
gained anything because it afterwards, still more sheepishly, let a         
few strongminded Puritans, inflamed by the masterpieces of Jewish           
revolutionary literature, cut off the heads of the three? Suppose           
the Gunpowder plot had succeeded, and set a Fawkes dynasty permanently      
on the throne, would it have made any difference to the present             
state of the nation? The guillotine was used in France up to the limit      
of human endurance, both on Girondins and Jacobins. Fouquier                
Tinville followed Marie Antoinette to the scaffold; and Marie               
Antoinette might have asked the crowd, just as pointedly as Fouquier        
did, whether their bread would be any cheaper when her head was off.        
And what came of it all? The Imperial France of the Rougon Macquart         
family, and the Republican France of the Panama scandal and the             
Dreyfus case. Was the difference worth the guillotining of all those        
unlucky ladies and gentlemen, useless and mischievous as many of            
them were? Would any sane man guillotine a mouse to bring about such a      
result? Turn to Republican America. America has no Star Chamber, and        
no feudal barons. But it has Trusts; and it has millionaires whose          
factories, fenced in by live electric wires and defended by                 
Pinkerton retainers with magazine rifles, would have made a Radical of      
Reginald Front de Boeuf. Would Washington or Franklin have lifted a         
finger in the cause of American Independence if they had foreseen           
its reality?                                                                
  No: what Caesar, Cromwell, Napoleon could not do with all the             
physical force and moral prestige of the State in their hands,              
cannot be done by enthusiastic criminals and lunatics. Even the             
Jews, who, from Moses to Marx and Lassalle, have inspired all the           
revolutions, have had to confess that, after all, the dog will              
return to his vomit and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in         
the mire; and we may as well make up our minds that Man will return to      
his idols and his cupidities, in spite of "movements" and all               
revolutions, until his nature is changed. Until then, his early             
successes in building commercial civilizations (and such                    
civilizations, Good Heavens!) are but preliminaries to the                  
inevitable later stage, now threatening us, in which the passions           
which built the civilization become fatal instead of productive,            
just as the same qualities which make the lion king in the forest           
ensure his destruction when he enters a city. Nothing can save society      
then except the clear head and the wide purpose: war and                    
competition, potent instruments of selection and evolution in one           
epoch, become ruinous instruments of degeneration in the next. In           
the breeding of animals and plants, varieties which have arisen by          
selection through many generations relapse precipitously into the wild      
type in a generation or two when selection ceases; and in the same way      
a civilization in which lusty pugnacity and greed have ceased to act        
as selective agents and have begun to obstruct and destroy, rushes          
downwards and backwards with a suddenness that enables an observer          
to see with consternation the upward steps of many centuries                
retraced in a single lifetime. This has often occurred even within the      
period covered by history; and in every instance the turning point has      
been reached long before the attainment, or even the general                
advocacy on paper, of the levelling-up of the mass to the highest           
point attainable by the best nourished and cultivated normal                
individuals.                                                                
  We must therefore frankly give up the notion that Man as he exists        
is capable of net progress. There will always be an illusion of             
progress, because wherever we are conscious of an evil we remedy it,        
and therefore always seem to ourselves to be progressing, forgetting        
that most of the evils we see are the effects, finally become acute,        
of long-unnoticed retrogressions; that our compromising remedies            
seldom fully recover the lost ground; above all, that on the lines          
along which we are degenerating, good has become evil in our eyes, and      
is being undone in the name of progress precisely as evil is undone         
and replaced by good on the lines along which we are evolving. This is      
indeed the Illusion of Illusions; for it gives us infallible and            
appalling assurance that if our political ruin is to come, it will          
be effected by ardent reformers and supported by enthusiastic patriots      
as a series of necessary steps in our progress. Let the Reformer,           
the Progressive, the Meliorist then reconsider himself and his eternal      
ifs and ans which never become pots and pans. Whilst Man remains            
what he is, there can be no progress beyond the point already attained      
and fallen headlong from at every attempt at civilization; and since        
even that point is but a pinnacle to which a few people cling in giddy      
terror above an abyss of squalor, mere progress should no longer charm      
us.                                                                         


                                 VIII                                       
                     THE CONCEIT OF CIVILIZATION                            

  AFTER all, the progress illusion is not so very subtle. We begin          
by reading the satires of our fathers' contemporaries; and we conclude      
(usually quite ignorantly) that the abuses exposed by them are              
things of the past. We see also that reforms of crying evils are            
frequently produced by the sectional shifting of political power            
from oppressors to oppressed. The poor man is given a vote by the           
Liberals in the hope that he will cast it for his emancipators. The         
hope is not fulfilled; but the lifelong imprisonment of penniless           
men for debt ceases; Factory Acts are passed to mitigate sweating;          
schooling is made free and compulsory; sanitary by-laws are                 
multiplied; public steps are taken to house the masses decently; the        
bare-footed get boots; rags become rare; and bathrooms and pianos,          
smart tweeds and starched collars, reach numbers of people who once,        
as "the unsoaped," played the Jew's harp or the accordion in moleskins      
and belchers. Some of these changes are gains: some of them are             
losses. Some of them are not changes at all: all of them are merely         
the changes that money makes. Still, they produce an illusion of            
bustling progress; and the reading class infers from them that the          
abuses of the early Victorian period no longer exist except as amusing      
pages in the novels of Dickens. But the moment we look for a reform         
due to character and not to money, to statesmanship and not to              
interest or mutiny, we are disillusioned. For example, we remembered        
the maladministration and incompetence revealed by the Crimean War          
as part of a by-gone state of things until the South African war            
shewed that the nation and the War Office, like those poor Bourbons         
who have been so impudently blamed for a universal characteristic, had      
learnt nothing and forgotten nothing. We had hardly recovered from the      
fruitless irritation of this discovery when it transpired that the          
officers' mess of our most select regiment included a flogging club         
presided over by the senior subaltern. The disclosure provoked some         
disgust at the details of this schoolboyish debauchery, but no              
surprise at the apparent absence of any conception of manly honor           
and virtue, of personal courage and self-respect, in the front rank of      
our chivalry. In civil affairs we had assumed that the sycophancy           
and idolatry which encouraged Charles I to undervalue the Puritan           
revolt of the XVII century had been long outgrown; but it has needed        
nothing but favorable circumstances to revive, with added abjectness        
to compensate for its lost piety. We have relapsed into disputes about      
transubstantiation at the very moment when the discovery of the wide        
prevalence of theophagy as a tribal custom has deprived us of the last      
excuse for believing that our official religious rites differ in            
essentials from those of barbarians. The Christian doctrine of the          
uselessness of punishment and the wickedness of revenge has not, in         
spite of its simple common sense, found a single convert among the          
nations: Christianity means nothing to the masses but a sensational         
public execution which is made an excuse for other executions. In           
its name we take ten years of a thief's life minute by minute in the        
slow misery and degradation of modern reformed imprisonment with as         
little remorse as Laud and his Star Chamber clipped the ears of             
Bastwick and Burton. We dug up and mutilated the remains of the             
Mahdi the other day exactly as we dug up and mutilated the remains          
of Cromwell two centuries ago. We have demanded the decapitation of         
the Chinese Boxer princes as any Tartar would have done; and our            
military and naval expeditions to kill, burn, and destroy tribes and        
villages for knocking an Englishman on the head are so common a part        
of our Imperial routine that the last dozen of them has not called          
forth as much pity as can be counted on by any lady criminal. The           
judicial use of torture to extort confession is supposed to be a relic      
of darker ages; but whilst these pages are being written an English         
judge has sentenced a forger to twenty years penal servitude with an        
open declaration that the sentence will be carried out in full              
unless he confesses where he has hidden the notes he forged. And no         
comment whatever is made, either on this or on a telegram from the          
seat of war in Somaliland mentioning that certain information has been      
given by a prisoner of war "under punishment." Even if these reports        
are false, the fact that they are accepted without protest as               
indicating a natural and proper course of public conduct shews that we      
are still as ready to resort to torture as Bacon was. As to vindictive      
cruelty, an incident in the South African war, when the relatives           
and friends of a prisoner were forced to witness his execution,             
betrayed a baseness of temper and character which hardly leaves us the      
right to plume ourselves on our superiority to Edward III at the            
surrender of Calais. And the democratic American officer indulges in        
torture in the Philippines just as the aristocratic English officer         
did in South Africa. The incidents of the white invasion of Africa          
in search of ivory, gold, diamonds, and sport, have proved that the         
modern European is the same beast of prey that formerly marched to the      
conquest of new worlds under Alexander, Antony, and Pizarro.                
Parliaments and vestries are just what they were when Cromwell              
suppressed them and Dickens derided them. The democratic politician         
remains exactly as Plato described him; the physician is still the          
credulous impostor and petulant scientific coxcomb whom Moliere             
ridiculed; the schoolmaster remains at best a pedantic child farmer         
and at worst a flagellomaniac; arbitrations are more dreaded by honest      
men than lawsuits; the philanthropist is still a parasite on misery as      
the doctor is on disease; the miracles of priestcraft are none the          
less fraudulent and mischievous because they are now called scientific      
experiments and conducted by professors; witchcraft, in the modern          
form of patent medicines and prophylactic inoculations, is rampant;         
the landowner who is no longer powerful enough to; set the mantrap          
of Rhampsinitis improves on it by barbed wire; the modern gentleman         
who is too lazy to daub his face with vermilion as a symbol of bravery      
employs a laundress to daub his shirt with starch as a symbol of            
cleanliness; we shake our heads at the dirt of the middle ages in           
cities made grimy with soot and foul and disgusting with shameless          
tobacco smoking; holy water, in its latest form of disinfectant fluid,      
is more widely used and believed in than ever; public health                
authorities deliberately go through incantations with burning               
sulphur (which they know to be useless) because the people believe          
in it as devoutly as the Italian peasant believes in the                    
liquefaction of the blood of St Januarius; and straightforward              
public lying has reached gigantic developments, there being nothing to      
choose in this respect between the pickpocket at the police station         
and the minister on the treasury bench, the editor in the newspaper         
office, the city magnate advertizing bicycle tires that do not              
side-slip, the clergyman subscribing the thirty-nine articles, and the      
vivisector who pledges his knightly honor that no animal operated on        
in the physiological laboratory suffers the slightest pain.                 
Hypocrisy is at its worst; for we not only persecute bigotedly but          
sincerely in the name of the cure-mongering witchcraft we do believe        
in, but callously and hypocritically in the name of the Evangelical         
creed that our rulers privately smile at as the Italian patricians          
of the fifth century smiled at Jupiter and Venus. Sport is, as it           
has always been, murderous excitement; the impulse to slaughter is          
universal; and museums are set up throughout the country to                 
encourage little children and elderly gentlemen to make collections of      
corpses preserved in alcohol, and to steal birds' eggs and keep them        
as the red Indian used to keep scalps. Coercion with the lash is as         
natural to an Englishman as it was to Solomon spoiling Rehoboam:            
indeed, the comparison is unfair to the Jews in view of the facts that      
the Mosaic law forbade more than forty lashes in the name of humanity,      
and that floggings of a thousand lashes were inflicted on English           
soldiers in the XVIII and XIX centuries, and would be inflicted             
still but for the change in the balance of political power between the      
military caste and the commercial classes and the proletariat. In           
spite of that change, flogging is still an institution in the public        
school, in the military prison, on the training ship, and in that           
school of littleness called the home. The lascivious clamor of the          
flagellomaniac for more of it, constant as the clamor for more              
insolence, more war, and lower rates, is tolerated and even                 
gratified because, having no moral ends in view, we have sense              
enough to see that nothing but brute coercion can impose our selfish        
will on others. Cowardice is universal; patriotism, public opinion,         
parental duty, discipline, religion, morality, are only fine names for      
intimidation; and cruelty, gluttony, and credulity keep cowardice in        
countenance. We cut the throat of a calf and hang it up by the heels        
to bleed to death so that our veal cutlet may be white; we nail             
geese to a board and cram them with food because we like the taste          
of liver disease; we tear birds to pieces to decorate our women's           
hats; we mutilate domestic animals for no reason at all except to           
follow an instinctively cruel fashion; and we connive at the most           
abominable tortures in the hope of discovering some magical cure for        
our own diseases by them.                                                   
  Now please observe that these are not exceptional developments of         
our admitted vices, deplored and prayed against by all good men. Not a      
word has been said here of the excesses of our Neros, of whom we            
have the full usual percentage. With the exception of the few military      
examples, which are mentioned mainly to shew that the education and         
standing of a gentleman, reinforced by the strongest conventions of         
honor, esprit de corps, publicity and responsibility, afford no           
better guarantees of conduct than the passions of a mob, the                
illustrations given above are commonplaces taken from the daily             
practices of our best citizens, vehemently defended in our                  
newspapers and in our pulpits. The very humanitarians who abhor them        
are stirred to murder by them: the dagger of Brutus and Ravaillac is        
still active in the hands of Caserio and Luccheni; and the pistol           
has come to its aid in the hands of Guiteau and Czolgosz. Our remedies      
are still limited to endurance or assassination; and the assassin is        
still judicially assassinated on the principle that two blacks make         
a white. The only novelty is in our methods: through the discovery          
of dynamite the overloaded musket of Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh has          
been superseded by the bomb; but Ravachol's heart burns just as             
Hamilton's did. The world will not bear thinking of to those who            
know what it is, even with the largest discount for the restraints          
of poverty on the poor and cowardice on the rich.                           
  All that can be said for us is that people must and do live and           
let live up to a certain point. Even the horse, with his docked tail        
and bitted jaw, finds his slavery mitigated by the fact that a total        
disregard of his need for food and rest would put his master to the         
expense of buying a new horse every second day; for you cannot work         
a horse to death and then pick up another one for nothing, as you           
can a laborer. But this natural check on inconsiderate selfishness          
is itself checked, partly by our shortsightedness, and partly by            
deliberate calculation; so that beside the man who, to his own loss,        
will shorten his horse's life in mere stinginess, we have the               
tramway company which discovers actuarially that though a horse may         
live from 24 to 40 years, yet it pays better to work him to death in 4      
and then replace him by a fresh victim. And human slavery, which has        
reached its worst recorded point within our own time in the form of         
free wage labor, has encountered the same personal and commercial           
limits to both its aggravation and its mitigation. Now that the             
freedom of wage labor has produced a scarcity of it, as in South            
Africa, the leading English newspaper and the leading English weekly        
review have openly and without apology demanded a return to compulsory      
labor: that is, to the methods by which, as we believe, the                 
Egyptians built the pyramids. We know now that the crusade against          
chattel slavery in the XIX century succeeded solely because chattel         
slavery was neither the most effective nor the least humane method          
of labor exploitation; and the world is now feeling its way towards         
a still more effective system which shall abolish the freedom of the        
worker without again making his exploiter responsible for him.              
  Still, there is always some mitigation: there is the fear of revolt;      
and there are the effects of kindliness and affection. Let it be            
repeated therefore that no indictment is here laid against the world        
on the score of what its criminals and monsters do. The fires of            
Smithfield and of the Inquisition were lighted by earnestly pious           
people, who were kind and good as kindness and goodness go. And when a      
negro is dipped in kerosene and set on fire in America at the               
present time, he is not a good man lynched by ruffians: he is a             
criminal lynched by crowds of respectable, charitable, virtuously           
indignant, high-minded citizens, who, though they act outside the law,      
are at least more merciful than the American legislators and judges         
who not so long ago condemned men to solitary confinement for periods,      
not of five months, as our own practice is, but of five years and           
more. The things that our moral monsters do may be left out of account      
with St Bartholomew massacres and other momentary outbursts of              
social disorder. Judge us by the admitted and respected practice of         
our most reputable circles; and, if you know the facts and are              
strong enough to look them in the face, you must admit that unless          
we are replaced by a more highly evolved animal- in short, by the           
Superman- the world must remain a den of dangerous animals among            
whom our few accidental supermen, our Shakespears, Goethes,                 
Shelleys, and their like, must live as precariously as lion tamers do,      
taking the humor of their situation, and the dignity of their               
superiority, as a set-off to the horror of the one and the                  
loneliness of the other.                                                    


                                  IX                                        
                        THE VERDICT OF HISTORY                              

  IT may be said that though the wild beast breaks out in Man and           
casts him back momentarily into barbarism under the excitement of           
war and crime, yet his normal life is higher than the normal life of        
his forefathers. This view is very acceptable to Englishmen, who            
always lean sincerely to virtue's side as long as it costs them             
nothing either in money or in thought. They feel deeply the                 
injustice of foreigners, who allow them no credit for this conditional      
highmindedness. But there is no reason to suppose that our ancestors        
were less capable of it than we are. To all such claims for the             
existence of a progressive moral evolution operating visibly from           
grandfather to grandson, there is the conclusive reply that a thousand      
years of such evolution would have produced enormous social changes,        
of which the historical evidence would be overwhelming. But not             
Macaulay himself, the most confident of Whig meliorists, can produce        
any such evidence that will bear cross-examination. Compare our             
conduct and our codes with those mentioned contemporarily in such           
ancient scriptures and classics as have come down to us, and you            
will find no jot of ground for the belief that any moral progress           
whatever has been made in historic time, in spite of all the                
romantic attempts of historians to reconstruct the past on that             
assumption. Within that time it has happened to nations as to               
private families and individuals that they have flourished and              
decayed, repented and hardened their hearts, submitted and                  
protested, acted and reacted, oscillated between natural and                
artificial sanitation (the oldest house in the world, unearthed the         
other day in Crete, has quite modern sanitary arrangements), and            
rung a thousand changes on the different scales of income and pressure      
of population, firmly believing all the time that mankind was               
advancing by leaps and bounds because men were constantly busy. And         
the mere chapter of accidents has left a small accumulation of              
chance discoveries, such as the wheel, the arch, the safety pin,            
gunpowder, the magnet, the Voltaic pile and so forth: things which,         
unlike the gospels and philosophic treatises of the sages, can be           
usefully understood and applied by common men; so that steam                
locomotion is possible without a nation of Stephensons, although            
national Christianity is impossible without a nation of Christs. But        
does any man seriously believe that the chauffeur who drives a motor      
car from Paris to Berlin is a more highly evolved man than the              
charioteer of Achilles, or that a modern Prime Minister is a more           
enlightened ruler than Caesar because he rides a tricycle, writes           
his dispatches by the electric light, and instructs his stockbroker         
through the telephone?                                                      
  Enough, then, of this goose-cackle about Progress: Man, as he is,         
never will nor can add a cubit to his stature by any of its                 
quackeries, political, scientific, educational, religious, or               
artistic. What is likely to happen when this conviction gets into           
the minds of the men whose present faith in these illusions is the          
cement of our social system, can be imagined only by those who know         
how suddenly a civilization which has long ceased to think (or in           
the old phrase, to watch and pray) can fall to pieces when the              
vulgar belief in its hypocrisies and impostures can no longer hold out      
against its failures and scandals. When religious and ethical formulae      
become so obsolete that no man of strong mind can believe them, they        
have also reached the point at which no man of high character will          
profess them; and from, that moment until they are formally                 
disestablished, they stand at the door of every profession and every        
public office to keep out every able man who is not a sophist or a          
liar. A nation which revises its parish councils once in three              
years, but will not revise its articles of religion once in three           
hundred, even when those articles avowedly began as a political             
compromise dictated by Mr Facing-Both-Ways, is a nation that needs          
remaking.                                                                   
  Our only hope, then, is in evolution. We must replace the man by the      
superman. It is frightful for the citizen, as the years pass him, to        
see his own contemporaries so exactly reproduced by the younger             
generation, that his companions of thirty years ago have their              
counterparts in every city crowd, where he had to check himself             
repeatedly in the act of saluting as an old friend some young man to        
whom he is only an elderly stranger. All hope of advance dies in his        
bosom as he watches them: he knows that they will do just what their        
fathers did, and that the few voices which will still, as always            
before, exhort them to do something else and be something better,           
might as well spare their breath to cool their porridge (if they can        
get any). Men like Ruskin and Carlyle will preach to Smith and Brown        
for the sake of preaching, just as St Francis preached to the birds         
and St Anthony to the fishes. But Smith and Brown, like the fishes and      
birds, remain as they are; and poets who plan Utopias and prove that        
nothing is necessary for their realization but that Man should will         
them, perceive at last, like Richard Wagner, that the fact to be faced      
is that Man does not effectively will them. And he never will until he      
becomes Superman.                                                           
  And so we arrive at the end of the Socialist's dream of "the              
socialization of the means of production and exchange," of the              
Positivist's dream of moralizing the capitalist, and of the ethical         
professor's, legislator's, educator's dream of putting commandments         
and codes and lessons and examination marks on a man as harness is put      
on a horse, ermine on a judge, pipeclay on a soldier, or a wig on an        
actor, and pretending that his nature has been changed. The only            
fundamental and possible Socialism is the socialization of the              
selective breeding of Man: in other terms, of human evolution. We must      
eliminate the Yahoo, or his vote will wreck the commonwealth.               

                                  X                                         
                              THE METHOD                                    

  AS to the method, what can be said as yet except that where there is      
a will, there is a way? If there be no will, we are lost. That is a         
possibility for our crazy little empire, if not for the universe;           
and as such possibilities are not to be entertained without despair,        
we must, whilst we survive, proceed on the assumption that we have          
still energy enough to not only will to live, but to will to live           
better. That may mean that we must establish a State Department of          
Evolution, with a seat in the Cabinet for its chief, and a revenue          
to defray the cost of direct State experiments, and provide                 
inducements to private persons to achieve successful results. It may        
mean a private society or a chartered company for the improvement of        
human live stock. But for the present it is far more likely to mean         
a blatant repudiation of such proposals as indecent and immoral, with,      
nevertheless, a general secret pushing of the human will in the             
repudiated direction; so that all sorts of institutions and public          
authorities will under some pretext or other feel their way                 
furtively towards the Superman. Mr Graham Wallas has already                
ventured to suggest, as Chairman of the School Management Committee of      
the London School Board, that the accepted policy of the Sterilization      
of the Schoolmistress, however administratively convenient, is open to      
criticism from the national stock-breeding point of view; and this          
is as good an example as any of the way in which the drift towards the      
Superman may operate in spite of all our hypocrisies. One thing at          
least is clear to begin with. If a woman can, by careful selection          
of a father, and nourishment of herself, produce a citizen with             
efficient senses, sound organs, and a good digestion, she should            
clearly be secured a sufficient reward for that natural service to          
make her willing to undertake and repeat it. Whether she be financed        
in the undertaking by herself, or by the father, or by a speculative        
capitalist, or by a new department of, say, the Royal Dublin                
Society, or (as at present) by the War Office maintaining her "on           
the strength" and authorizing a particular soldier to marry her, or by      
a local authority under a by-law directing that women may under             
certain circumstances have a year's leave of absence on full salary,        
or by the central government, does not matter provided the result be        
satisfactory.                                                               
  It is a melancholy fact that as the vast majority of women and their      
husbands have, under existing circumstances, not enough nourishment,        
no capital, no credit, and no knowledge of science or business, they        
would, if the State would pay for birth as it now pays for death, be        
exploited by joint stock companies for dividends, just as they are          
in ordinary industries. Even a joint stock human stud farm (piously         
disguised as a reformed Foundling Hospital or something of that             
sort) might well, under proper inspection and regulation, produce           
better results than our present reliance on promiscuous marriage. It        
may be objected that when an ordinary contractor produces stores for        
sale to the Government, and the Government rejects them as not up to        
the required standard, the condemned goods are either sold for what         
they will fetch or else scrapped: that is, treated as waste                 
material; whereas if the goods consisted of human beings, all that          
could be done would be to let them loose or send them to the nearest        
workhouse. But there is nothing new in private enterprise throwing its      
human refuse on the cheap labor market and the workhouse; and the           
refuse of the new industry would presumably be better bred than the         
staple product of ordinary poverty. In our present happy-go-lucky           
industrial disorder, all the human products, successful or not,             
would have to be thrown on the labor market; but the unsuccessful ones      
would not entitle the company to a bounty and so would be a dead            
loss to it. The practical commercial difficulty would be the                
uncertainty and the cost in time and money of the first experiments.        
Purely commercial capital would not touch such heroic operations            
during the experimental stage; and in any case the strength of mind         
needed for so momentous a new departure could not be fairly expected        
from the Stock Exchange. It will have to be handled by statesmen            
with character enough to tell our democracy and plutocracy that             
statecraft does not consist in flattering their follies or applying         
their suburban standards of propriety to the affairs of four                
continents. The matter must be taken up either by the State or by some      
organization strong enough to impose respect upon the State.                
  The novelty of any such experiment, however, is only in the scale of      
it. In one conspicuous case, that of royalty, the State does already        
select the parents on purely political grounds; and in the peerage,         
though the heir to a dukedom is legally free to marry a dairymaid, yet      
the social pressure on him to confine his choice to politically and         
socially eligible mates is so overwhelming that he is really no more        
free to marry the dairymaid than George IV was to marry Mrs                 
Fitzherbert; and such a marriage could only occur as a result of            
extraordinary strength of character on the part of the dairymaid            
acting upon extraordinary weakness on the part of the duke. Let             
those who think the whole conception of intelligent breeding absurd         
and scandalous ask themselves why George IV was not allowed to              
choose his own wife whilst any tinker could marry whom he pleased?          
Simply because it did not matter a rap politically whom the tinker          
married, whereas it mattered very much whom the king married. The           
way in which all considerations of the king's personal rights, of           
the claims of the heart, of the sanctity of the marriage oath, and          
of romantic morality crumpled up before this political need shews           
how negligible all these apparently irresistible prejudices are when        
they come into conflict with the demand for quality in our rulers.          
We learn the same lesson from the case of the soldier, whose marriage,      
when it is permitted at all, is despotically controlled with a view         
solely to military efficiency.                                              
  Well, nowadays it is not the King that rules, but the tinker.             
Dynastic wars are no longer feared, dynastic alliances no longer            
valued. Marriages in royal families are becoming rapidly less               
political, and more popular, domestic, and romantic. If all the             
kings in Europe were made as free tomorrow as King Cophetua, nobody         
but their aunts and chamberlains would feel a moment's anxiety as to        
the consequences. On the other hand a sense of the social importance        
of the tinker's marriage has been steadily growing. We have made a          
public matter of his wife's health in the month after her confinement.      
We have taken the minds of his children out of his hands and put            
them into those of our State schoolmaster. We shall presently make          
their bodily nourishment independent of him. But they are still             
riff-raff; and to hand the country over to riff-raff is national            
suicide, since riff-raff can neither govern nor will let anyone else        
govern except the highest bidder of bread and circuses. There is no         
public enthusiast alive of twenty years' practical democratic               
experience who believes in the political adequacy of the electorate or      
of the bodies it elects. The overthrow of the aristocrat has created        
the necessity for the Superman.                                             
  Englishmen hate Liberty and Equality too much to understand them.         
But every Englishman loves and desires a pedigree. And in that he is        
right. King Demos must be bred like all other Kings; and with Must          
there is no arguing. It is idle for an individual writer to carry so        
great a matter further in a pamphlet. A conference on the subject is        
the next step needed. It will be attended by men and women who, no          
longer believing that they can live for ever, are seeking for some          
immortal work into which they can build the best of themselves              
before their refuse is thrown into that arch dust destructor, the           
cremation furnace.                                                          


                      MAXIMS FOR REVOLUTIONISTS                             

  THE GOLDEN RULE                                                           
  DO not do unto others as you would that they should do unto you.          
Their tastes may not be the same.                                           
  Never resist temptation: prove all things: hold fast that which is        
good.                                                                       
  Do not love your neighbor as yourself. If you are on good terms with      
yourself it is an impertinence: if on bad, an injury.                       
  The golden rule is that there are no golden rules.                        

  IDOLATRY                                                                  
  The art of government is the organization of idolatry.                    
  The bureaucracy consists of functionaries; the aristocracy, of            
idols; the democracy, of idolaters.                                         
  The populace cannot understand the bureaucracy: it can only               
worship the national idols.                                                 
  The savage bows down to idols of wood and stone: the civilized man        
to idols of flesh and blood.                                                
  A limited monarchy is a device for combining the inertia of a wooden      
idol with the credibility of a flesh and blood one.                         
  When the wooden idol does not answer the peasant's prayer, he             
beats it: when the flesh and blood idol does not satisfy the civilized      
man, he cuts its head off.                                                  
  He who slays a king and he who dies for him are alike idolaters.          

  ROYALTY                                                                   
  Kings are not born: they are made by artificial hallucination.            
When the process is interrupted by adversity at a critical age, as          
in the case of Charles II, the subject becomes sane and never               
completely recovers his kingliness.                                         
  The Court is the servant's hall of the sovereign.                         
  Vulgarity in a king flatters the majority of the nation.                  
  The flunkeyism propagated by the throne is the price we pay for           
its political convenience.                                                  

  DEMOCRACY                                                                 
  If the lesser mind could measure the greater as a footrule can            
measure a pyramid, there would be finality in universal suffrage. As        
it is, the political problem remains unsolved.                              
  Democracy substitutes election by the incompetent many for                
appointment by the corrupt few.                                             
  Democratic republics can no more dispense with national idols than        
monarchies with public functionaries.                                       
  Government presents only one problem: the discovery of a trustworthy      
anthropometric method.                                                      

  IMPERIALISM                                                               
  Excess of insularity makes a Briton an Imperialist.                       
  Excess of local self-assertion makes a colonist an Imperialist.           
  A colonial Imperialist is one who raises colonial troops, equips a        
colonial squadron, claims a Federal Parliament sending its measures to      
the Throne instead of to the Colonial Office, and, being finally            
brought by this means into insoluble conflict with the insular British      
Imperialist, "cuts the painter" and breaks up the Empire.                   

  LIBERTY AND EQUALITY                                                      
  He who confuses political liberty with freedom and political              
equality with similarity has never thought for five minutes about           
either.                                                                     
  Nothing can be unconditional: consequently nothing can be free.           
  Liberty means responsibility. That is why most men dread it.              
  The duke inquires contemptuously whether his gamekeeper is the equal      
of the Astronomer Royal; but he insists that they shall both be hanged      
equally if they murder him.                                                 
  The notion that the colonel need be a better man than the private is      
as confused as the notion that the keystone need be stronger than           
the coping stone.                                                           
  Where equality is undisputed, so also is subordination.                   
  Equality is fundamental in every department of social organization.       
  The relation of superior to inferior excludes good manners.               

  EDUCATION                                                                 
  When a man teaches something he does not know to somebody else who        
has no aptitude for it, and gives him a certificate of proficiency,         
the latter has completed the education of a gentleman.                      
  A fool's brain digests philosophy into folly, science into                
superstition, and art into pedantry. Hence University education.            
  The best brought-up children are those who have seen their parents        
as they are. Hypocrisy is not the parent's first duty.                      
  The vilest abortionist is he who attempts to mould a child's              
character.                                                                  
  At the University every great treatise is postponed until its author      
attains impartial judgment and perfect knowledge. If a horse could          
wait as long for its shoes and would pay for them in advance, our           
blacksmiths would all be college dons.                                      
  He who can, does. He who cannot, teaches.                                 
  A learned man is an idler who kills time with study. Beware of his        
false knowledge: it is more dangerous than ignorance.                       
  Activity is the only road to knowledge.                                   
  Every fool believes what his teachers tell him, and calls his             
credulity science or morality as confidently as his father called it        
divine revelation.                                                          
  No man fully capable of his own language ever masters another.            
  No man can be a pure specialist without being in the strict sense an      
idiot.                                                                      
  Do not give your children moral and religious instruction unless you      
are quite sure they will not take it too seriously. Better be the           
mother of Henri Quatre and Nell Gwynne than of Robespierre and Queen        
Mary Tudor.                                                                 

  MARRIAGE                                                                  
  Marriage is popular because it combines the maximum of temptation         
with the maximum of opportunity.                                            
  Marriage is the only legal contract which abrogates as between the        
parties all the laws that safeguard the particular relation to which        
it refers.                                                                  
  The essential function of marriage is the continuance of the race,        
as stated in the Book of Common Prayer.                                     
  The accidental function of marriage is the gratification of the           
amoristic sentiment of mankind.                                             
  The artificial sterilization of marriage makes it possible for            
marriage to fulfil its accidental function whilst neglecting its            
essential one.                                                              
  The most revolutionary invention of the XIX century was the               
artificial sterilization of marriage.                                       
  Any marriage system which condemns a majority of the population to        
celibacy will be violently wrecked on the pretext that it outrages          
morality.                                                                   
  Polygamy, when tried under modern democratic conditions, as by the        
Mormons, is wrecked by the revolt of the mass of inferior men who           
are condemned to celibacy by it; for the maternal instinct leads a          
woman to prefer a tenth share in a first rate man to the exclusive          
possession of a third rate one. Polyandry has not been tried under          
these conditions.                                                           
  The minimum of national celibacy (ascertained by dividing the number      
of males in the community by the number of females, and taking the          
quotient as the number of wives or husbands permitted to each               
person) is secured in England (where the quotient is 1) by the              
institution of monogamy.                                                    
  The modern sentimental term for the national minimum of celibacy          
is Purity.                                                                  
  Marriage, or any other form of promiscuous amoristic monogamy, is         
fatal to large States because it puts its ban on the deliberate             
breeding of man as a political animal.                                      

  CRIME AND PUNISHMENT                                                      
  All scoundrelism is summed up in the phrase "Que Messieurs les            
Assassins commencent!"                                                      
  The man who has graduated from the flogging block at Eton to the          
bench from which he sentences the garotter to be flogged is the same        
social product as the garotter who has been kicked by his father and        
cuffed by his mother until he has grown strong enough to throttle           
and rob the rich citizen whose money he desires.                            
  Imprisonment is as irrevocable as death.                                  
  Criminals do not die by the hands of the law. They die by the             
hands of other men.                                                         
  The assassin Czolgosz made President McKinley a hero by                   
assassinating him. The United States of America made Czolgosz a hero        
by the same process.                                                        
  Assassination on the scaffold is the worst form of assassination,         
because there it is invested with the approval of society.                  
  It is the deed that teaches, not the name we give it. Murder and          
capital punishment are not opposites that cancel one another, but           
similars that breed their kind.                                             
  Crime is only the retail department of what, in wholesale, we call        
penal law.                                                                  
  When a man wants to murder a tiger he calls it sport: when the tiger      
wants to murder him he calls it ferocity. The distinction between           
Crime and Justice is no greater.                                            
  Whilst we have prisons it matters little which of us occupy the           
cells.                                                                      
  The most anxious man in a prison is the governor.                         
  It is not necessary to replace a guillotined criminal: it is              
necessary to replace a guillotined social system.                           

  TITLES                                                                    
  Titles distinguish the mediocre, embarrass the superior, and are          
disgraced by the inferior.                                                  
  Great men refuse titles because they are jealous of them.                 

  HONOR                                                                     
  There are no perfectly honorable men; but every true man has one          
main point of honor and a few minor ones.                                   
  You cannot believe in honor until you have achieved it. Better            
keep yourself clean and bright: you are the window through which you        
must see the world.                                                         
  Your word can never be as good as your bond, because your memory can      
never be as trustworthy as your honor.                                      

  PROPERTY                                                                  
  Property, said Proudhon, is theft. This is the only perfect truism        
that has been uttered on the subject.                                       

  SERVANTS                                                                  
  When domestic servants are treated as human beings it is not worth        
while to keep them.                                                         
  The relation of master and servant is advantageous only to masters        
who do not scruple to abuse their authority, and to servants who do         
not scruple to abuse their trust.                                           
  The perfect servant, when his master makes humane advances to him,        
feels that his existence is threatened, and hastens to change his           
place.                                                                      
  Masters and servants are both tyrannical; but the masters are the         
more dependent of the two.                                                  
  A man enjoys what he uses, not what his servants use.                     
  Man is the only animal which esteems itself rich in proportion to         
the number and voracity of its parasites.                                   
  Ladies and gentlemen are permitted to have friends in the kennel,         
but not in the kitchen.                                                     
  Domestic servants, by making spoiled children of their masters,           
are forced to intimidate them in order to be able to live with them.        
  In a slave state, the slaves rule: in Mayfair, the tradesman rules.       

  HOW TO BEAT CHILDREN                                                      
  If you strike a child, take care that you strike it in anger, even        
at the risk of maiming it for life. A blow in cold blood neither can        
nor should be forgiven.                                                     
  If you beat children for pleasure, avow your object frankly, and          
play the game according to the rules, as a foxhunter does; and you          
will do comparatively little harm. No foxhunter is such a cad as to         
pretend that he hunts the fox to teach it not to steal chickens, or         
that he suffers more acutely than the fox at the death. Remember            
that even in childbeating there is the sportsman's way and the cad's        
way.                                                                        

  RELIGION                                                                  
  Beware of the man whose god is in the skies.                              
  What a man believes may be ascertained, not from his creed, but from      
the assumptions on which he habitually acts.                                

  VIRTUES AND VICES                                                         
  No specific virtue or vice in a man implies the existence of any          
other specific virtue or vice in him, however closely the                   
imagination may associate them.                                             
  Virtue consists, not in abstaining from vice, but in not desiring         
it.                                                                         
  Self-denial is not a virtue: it is only the effect of prudence on         
rascality.                                                                  
  Obedience simulates subordination as fear of the police simulates         
honesty.                                                                    
  Disobedience, the rarest and most courageous of the virtues, is           
seldom distinguished from neglect, the laziest and commonest of the         
vices.                                                                      
  Vice is waste of life. Poverty, obedience, and celibacy are the           
canonical vices.                                                            
  Economy is the art of making the most of life.                            
  The love of economy is the root of all virtue.                            

  FAIRPLAY                                                                  
  The love of fairplay is a spectator's virtue, not a principal's.          

  GREATNESS                                                                 
  Greatness is only one of the sensations of littleness.                    
  In heaven an angel is nobody in particular.                               
  Greatness is the secular name for Divinity: both mean simply what         
lies beyond us.                                                             
  If a great man could make us understand him, we should hang him.          
  We admit that when the divinity we worshipped made itself visible         
and comprehensible we crucified it.                                         
  To a mathematician the eleventh means only a single unit: to the          
bushman who cannot count further than his ten fingers it is an              
incalculable myriad.                                                        
  The difference between the shallowest routineer and the deepest           
thinker appears, to the latter, trifling; to the former, infinite.          
  In a stupid nation the man of genius becomes a god: everybody             
worships him and nobody does his will.                                      

  BEAUTY AND HAPPINESS, ART AND RICHES                                      
  Happiness and Beauty are by-products.                                     
  Folly is the direct pursuit of Happiness and Beauty.                      
  Riches and Art are spurious receipts for the production of Happiness      
and Beauty.                                                                 
  He who desires a lifetime of happiness with a beautiful woman             
desires to enjoy the taste of wine by keeping his mouth always full of      
it.                                                                         
  The most intolerable pain is produced by prolonging the keenest           
pleasure.                                                                   
  The man with toothache thinks everyone happy whose teeth are              
sound. The poverty stricken man makes the same mistake about the            
rich man.                                                                   
  The more a man possesses over and above what he uses, the more            
careworn he becomes.                                                        
  The tyranny that forbids you to make the road with pick and shovel        
is worse than that which prevents you from lolling along it in a            
carriage and pair.                                                          
  In an ugly and unhappy world the richest man can purchase nothing         
but ugliness and unhappiness.                                               
  In his efforts to escape from ugliness and unhappiness the rich           
man intensifies both. Every new yard of West End creates a new acre of      
East End.                                                                   
  The XIX century was the Age of Faith in Fine Art. The results are         
before us.                                                                  

  THE PERFECT GENTLEMAN                                                     
  The fatal reservation of the gentleman is that he sacrifices              
everything to his honor except his gentility.                               
  A gentleman of our days is one who has money enough to do what every      
fool would do if he could afford it: that is, consume without               
producing.                                                                  
  The true diagnostic of modern gentility is parasitism.                    
  No elaboration of physical or moral accomplishment can atone for the      
sin of parasitism.                                                          
  A modern gentleman is necessarily the enemy of his country. Even          
in war he does not fight to defend it, but to prevent his power of          
preying on it from passing to a foreigner. Such combatants are              
patriots in the same sense as two dogs fighting for a bone are              
lovers of animals.                                                          
  The North American Indian was a type of the sportsman warrior             
gentleman. The Periclean Athenian was a type of the intellectually and      
artistically cultivated gentleman. Both were political failures. The        
modern gentleman, without the hardihood of the one or the culture of        
the other, has the appetite of both put together. He will not               
succeed where they failed.                                                  
  He who believes in education, criminal law, and sport, needs only         
property to make him a perfect modern gentleman.                            

  MODERATION                                                                
  Moderation is never applauded for its own sake.                           
  A moderately honest man with a moderately faithful wife, moderate         
drinkers both, in a moderately healthy house: that is the true              
middle class unit.                                                          

  THE UNCONSCIOUS SELF                                                      
  The unconscious self is the real genius. Your breathing goes wrong        
the moment your conscious self meddles with it.                             
  Except during the nine months before he draws his first breath, no        
man manages his affairs as well as a tree does.                             

  REASON                                                                    
  The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one      
persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all             
progress depends on the unreasonable man.                                   
  The man who listens to Reason is lost: Reason enslaves all whose          
minds are not strong enough to master her.                                  

  DECENCY                                                                   
  Decency is Indecency's Conspiracy of Silence.                             

  EXPERIENCE                                                                
  Men are wise in proportion, not to their experience, but to their         
capacity for experience.                                                    
  If we could learn from mere experience, the stones of London would        
be wiser than its wisest men.                                               

  TIME'S REVENGES                                                           
  Those whom we called brutes had their revenge when Darwin shewed          
us that they are our cousins.                                               
  The thieves had their revenge when Marx convicted the bourgeoisie of      
theft.                                                                      

  GOOD INTENTIONS                                                           
  Hell is paved with good intentions, not with bad ones.                    
  All men mean well.                                                        

  NATURAL RIGHTS                                                            
  The Master of Arts, by proving that no man has any natural rights,        
compels himself to take his own for granted.                                
  The right to live is abused whenever it is not constantly                 
challenged.                                                                 

  FAUTE DE MIEUX                                                            
  In my childhood I demurred to the description of a certain young          
lady as "the pretty Miss So and So." My aunt rebuked me by saying           
"Remember always that the least plain sister is the family beauty."         
  No age or condition is without its heroes. The least incapable            
general in a nation is its Caesar, the least imbecile statesman its         
Solon, the least confused thinker its Socrates, the least                   
commonplace poet its Shakespear.                                            

  CHARITY                                                                   
  Charity is the most mischievous sort of pruriency.                        
  Those who minister to poverty and disease are accomplices in the two      
worst of all the crimes.                                                    
  He who gives money he has not earned is generous with other people's      
labor.                                                                      
  Every genuinely benevolent person loathes almsgiving and mendicity.       

  FAME                                                                      
  Life levels all men: death reveals the eminent.                           

  DISCIPLINE                                                                
  Mutiny Acts are needed only by officers who command without               
authority. Divine right needs no whip.                                      

  WOMEN IN THE HOME                                                         
  Home is the girl's prison and the woman's workhouse.                      

  CIVILIZATION                                                              
  Civilization is a disease produced by the practice of building            
societies with rotten material.                                             
  Those who admire modern civilization usually identify it with the         
steam engine and the electric telegraph.                                    
  Those who understand the steam engine and the electric telegraph          
spend their lives in trying to replace them with something better.          
  The imagination cannot conceive a viler criminal than he who              
should build another London like the present one, nor a greater             
benefactor than he who should destroy it.                                   

  GAMBLING                                                                  
  The most popular method of distributing wealth is the method of           
the roulette table.                                                         
  The roulette table pays nobody except him that keeps it.                  
Nevertheless a passion for gaming is common, though a passion for           
keeping roulette tables is unknown.                                         
  Gambling promises the poor what Property performs for the rich: that      
is why the bishops dare not denounce it fundamentally.                      

  THE SOCIAL QUESTION                                                       
  Do not waste your time on Social Questions. What is the matter            
with the poor is Poverty: what is the matter with the rich is               
Uselessness.                                                                

  STRAY SAYINGS                                                             
  We are told that when Jehovah created the world he saw that it was        
good. What would he say now?                                                
  The conversion of a savage to Christianity is the conversion of           
Christianity to savagery.                                                   
  No man dares say so much of what he thinks as to appear to himself        
an extremist.                                                               
  Mens sana in corpore sano is a foolish saying. The sound body is a        
product of the sound mind.                                                  
  Decadence can find agents only when it wears the mask of progress.        
  In moments of progress the noble succeed, because things are going        
their way: in moments of decadence the base succeed for the same            
reason: hence the world is never without the exhilaration of                
contemporary success.                                                       
  The reformer for whom the world is not good enough finds himself          
shoulder to shoulder with him that is not good enough for the world.        
  Every man over forty is a scoundrel.                                      
  Youth, which is forgiven everything, forgives itself nothing: age,        
which forgives itself everything, is forgiven nothing.                      
  When we learn to sing that Britons never will be masters we shall         
make an end of slavery.                                                     
  Do not mistake your objection to defeat for an objection to               
fighting, your objection to being a slave for an objection to slavery,      
your objection to not being as rich as your neighbor for an                 
objection to poverty. The cowardly, the insubordinate, and the envious      
share your objections.                                                      
  Take care to get what you like or you will be forced to like what         
you get. Where there is no ventilation fresh air is declared                
unwholesome. Where there is no religion hypocrisy becomes good              
taste. Where there is no knowledge ignorance calls itself science.          
  If the wicked flourish and the fittest survive, Nature must be the        
God of rascals.                                                             
  If history repeats itself, and the unexpected always happens, how         
incapable must Man be of learning from experience!                          
  Compassion is the fellow-feeling of the unsound.                          
  Those who understand evil pardon it: those who resent it destroy it.      
  Acquired notions of propriety are stronger than natural instincts.        
It is easier to recruit for monasteries and convents than to induce an      
Arab woman to uncover her mouth in public, or a British officer to          
walk through Bond Street in a golfing cap on an afternoon in May.           
  It is dangerous to be sincere unless you are also stupid.                 
  The Chinese tame fowls by clipping their wings, and women by              
deforming their feet. A petticoat round the ankles serves equally           
well.                                                                       
  Political Economy and Social Economy are amusing intellectual games;      
but Vital Economy is the Philosopher Stone.                                 
  When a heretic wishes to avoid martyrdom he speaks of "Orthodoxy,         
True and False" and demonstrates that the True is his heresy.               
  Beware of the man who does not return your blow: he neither forgives      
you nor allows you to forgive yourself.                                     
  If you injure your neighbor, better not do it by halves.                  
  Sentimentality is the error of supposing that quarter can be given        
or taken in moral conflicts.                                                
  Two starving men cannot be twice as hungry as one; but two rascals        
can be ten times as vicious as one.                                         
  Make your cross your crutch; but when you see another man do it,          
beware of him.                                                              

  SELF-SACRIFICE                                                            
  Self-sacrifice enables us to sacrifice other people without               
blushing.                                                                   
  If you begin by sacrificing yourself to those you love, you will end      
by hating those to whom you have sacrificed yourself.                       

                              --End--
