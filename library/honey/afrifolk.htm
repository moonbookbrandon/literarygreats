LITERATURE ON SOUTH-AFRICAN FOLK-LORE 148

SOUTH-AFRICAN
FOLK-TALES
INTRODUCTION
IN presenting these stories, which are of deep interest and value to South 
Africans, I hope they may prove of some value to those Americans who have 
either an interest in animals or who appreciate the folklore of other 
countries.

Many of these tales have appeared among English collections previous to 
1880, others have been translated from the Dutch, and a few have been 
written from childhood remembrance. Consequently they do not pretend to be 
original or unique. Care has been taken not to spoil the ethnological value 
for the sake of form or structure; and in all cases they are as nearly like 
the original as a translation from one tongue to another will allow. They 
are all South-African folklore tales and mainly from the Bushmen. Some are 
perverted types from what were originally Bushmen tales, but have been taken 
over by Hottentots or Zulus; a few are from the Dutch. Most of these last 
named will show a European influence, especially French.

Some of the animal stories have appeared in American magazines under the 
author's name, but this is the first time that a complete collection has 
appeared since Dr. Bleek published his stories in 1864. The object has been 
to keep the stories apart from those which have a mythological or religious 
significance, and especially to keep it an animal collection free from those 
in which man appears to take a part.

There will be found several versions of the same story, and as far as 
possible these will be put in the order of their importance in relation to 
the original. The author does not pretend to be an authority on South-
African folklore, but has only a South-African-born interest in what springs 
from that country of sunshine. It is a difficult task to attempt to trace 
the origin of these stories, as there is no country where there have been so 
many distinct and primitive races dwelling together.

The Bushmen seem to trace back to the earliest Egyptian days, when dwarfs 
were pictured on the tombs of the kings and were a distinct race. From then 
until now it has been their pride to say that before men were men, they 
were; or, to put it clearer, before Africa was inhabited by other races, 
they were there. As represented by some of these stories of the Bushmen, 
what races have not, then, had their influence on the folklore? According to 
Stow, they were a wandering primitive race of small men, painters and 
sculptors, hunters and herdsmen, and withal a race showing traces of won 
derful reasoning and adaptability, with a keen sense of justice and a store 
of pride. Mythological some of their stories are, but whether this is due to 
the influence of the Hottentots, a later race, it is difficult to say. And, 
lastly, there are the Kaffirs spread over the whole of South Africa, 
domineering, but backward. The varied influences which may have affected 
these stories before they reached us show what enormous possibilities there 
are for error in tracing the origin of the animal tales here presented. 
Bleek finds that a greater congeniality exists between tbe Hottentot and 
European mind than is found between the latter and any other of the black 
races of Africa. Whether he means that this indicates a European origin of 
the fables, I cannot say. There is no doubt in my mind that the Bushmen came 
from the north and were the primitive race of south and tropical Africa, the 
dwarfs of Livingstone, Stanley, and other explorers. Considering, then, the 
great antiquity of this race, it naturally follows that if these stories are 
not original with the Bushmen, they are at least so modified as to bear no 
resemblance to Egyptian, Plicenician, or any other ancient race which the 
Bushmen may have come in contact with. Herodotus described a race on the 
upper Nile which corresponds with later descriptions of the Bushmen in 
tropical and southern Africa.

I agree with what the South-African Folklore Journal stated twenty years or 
more ago, that with the "vast strides South Africa is making in the progress 
of civilization, the native races will either be swept away or so altered as 
to lose many of their ancient habits, customs, traditions, or at least 
greatly to modify them."

Knowing that by a collection of this kind these stories could best be 
preserved, and feeling that others had not read them, I began this 
collection ten years ago. There is so much done now to preserve what is 
still Bushmen folklore that I feel this small volume is indeed only a small 
addition to the folklore world.

"South-African folklore is," the South-African Folklore Journal says, "in 
its very nature plain, and primitive in its simplicity; not adorned with the 
wealth of palaces and precious stones to be met with in the folklore of more 
civilized nations, but descriptive in great measure of the events of 
everyday life, among those in a low state of civilization; and with the 
exception of evidences of moral qualities, and of such imagery as is 
connected with the phenomena of nature, very little that is grand or 
magnificent must be looked for in it."

Bain gives a story related by a Kaffir which shows " the distribution of 
animals after the creation." This story could not become typically Kaffir 
until after the Kaffir came in contact with the European in the last two or 
three hundred years. However, the story will serve to illustrate the people 
whose stories appear in this volume and to close the Introduction.

Teco, in Kaffir, is the Supreme Being. Teco had every description of stock 
and property.

There were three nations created, viz., the Whites, the Amakosa, or Kaffirs, 
and the Amalouw, or Hottentots. A day was appointed for them to appear 
before the Teco to receive whatever he might apportion to each tribe. While 
they were assembling, a honey bird, or honey guide, came fluttering by, and 
all the Hottentots ran after it, whistling and making the peculiar noise 
they generally do while following this wonderful little bird. The Teco 
remonstrated with them about their behavior, but to no purpose. He thereupon 
denounced them as a vagrant race that would have to exist on wild roots and 
honey beer, and possess no stock whatever.

When the fine herds of cattle were brought, the Kaffirs became very much 
excited-the one exclaiming, "That black and white cow is mine!" and another, 
"That red cow and black bull are mine!" and so on, till at last the Teco, 
whose patience had been severely taxed by their shouts and unruly behavior, 
denounced them as a restless people, who would only possess cattle.

The Whites patiently waited until they received cattle, horses, sheep, and 
all sorts of property. Hence, the old Kaffir observed, "You Whites have got 
everything. We Kaffirs have only cattle, while the Amalouw, or Hottentots, 
have nothing."

CAMBRIDGE, MASS., June, 1910.

ORIGIN OF THE DIFFERENCE IN MODES OF LIFE BETWEEN HOTTENTOTS AND BUSHMEN
IN the beginning there were two. One was blind, the other was always 
hunting. This hunter found at last a hole in the earth from which game 
proceeded and killed the young. The blind man, feeling and smelling them, 
said, "They are not game, but cattle."

The blind man afterwards recovered his sight, and going with the hunter to 
this hole, saw that they were cows with their calves. He then quickly built 
a kraal (fence made of thorns) round them, and anointed himself, just as 
Hottentots (in their native state) are still wont to do.

When the other, who now with great trouble had to seek his game, came and 
saw this, he wanted to anoint himself also. "Look here!" said the other, 
"you must throw the ointment into the fire, and afterwards use it." He 
followed this advice, and the flames flaring up into his face, burnt him 
most miserably; so that he was glad to make his escape. The other, however, 
called to him: "Here, take the kirri (a knobstick), and run to the hills to 
hunt there for honey."

Hence sprung the race of Bushmen.

THE LOST MESSAGE
THE ant has had from time immemorial many enemies, and because he is small 
and destructive, there have been a great many slaughters among them. Not 
only were most of the birds their enemies, but Anteater lived almost wholly 
from them, and Centipede beset them every time and at all places when he had 
the chance.

So now there were a few among them who thought it would be well to hold 
council together and see if they could not come to some arrangement whereby 
they could retreat to some place of safety when attacked by robber birds and 
aninials.

But at the gathering their opinions were most discordant, and they could 
come to no decision.

There was Red-ant, Rice-ant, Black-ant, Wagtail-ant, Gray-ant, Shining-ant, 
and many other varieties. The discussion was a true babel of diversity, 
which continued for a long time and came to nothing.

A part desired that they should all go into a small hole in the ground, and 
live there; another part wanted to have a large and strong dwelling built on 
the ground, where nobody could enter but an ant; still another wanted to 
dwell in trees, so as to get rid of Anteater, forgetting entirely that there 
they would be the prey of birds; another part seemed inclined to have wings 
and fly.

And, as has already been said, this deliberation amounted to nothing, and 
each party resolved to go to work in its own way, and on its own 
responsibility.

Greater unity than that which existed in each separate faction could be seen 
nowhere in the world; each had his appointed task, each did his work 
regularly and well. And all worked together in the same way. From among them 
they chose a king-that is to say some of the groups did-and they divided the 
labor so that all went as smoothly as it possibly could.

But each group did it in its own way, and not one of them thought of 
protecting themselves against the onslaught of birds or Anteater.

The Red-ants built their house on the ground and lived under it, but 
Anteater leveled to the ground in a minute what had cost them many days of 
precious labor. The Rice-ants lived under the ground, and with them it went 
no better. For whenever they came out, Anteater visited them and took them 
out sack and pack. The Wagtail-ants fled to the trees, but there on many 
occasions sat Centipede waiting for them, or the birds gobbled them up. The 
Gray-ants had intended to save themselves from extermination by taking to 
flight, but this also availed them nothing, because the Lizard, the Hunting-
spider, and the birds went a great deal faster than they.

When the Insect-king heard that they could come to no agreement he sent them 
the secret of unity, and the message of Work-together. But unfortunately he 
chose for his messenger the Beetle, and he has never yet arrived at the 
Ants, so that they are still to-day the embodiment of discord and 
consequently the prey of enemies.

THE MONKEY'S FIDDLE
HUNGER and want forced Monkey one day to forsake his land and to seek 
elsewhere among strangers for much-needed work. Bulbs, earth beans, 
scorpions, insects, and such things were completely exhausted in his own 
land. But fortunately he received, for the time being, shelter with a great 
uncle of his, Orang Outang, who lived in another part of the country.

When he had worked for quite a while he wanted to return home, and as 
recompense his great uncle gave him a fiddle and a bow and arrow and told 
him that with the bow and arrow he could hit and kill anything he desired, 
and with the fiddle he could force anything to dance.

The first he met upon his return to his own land was Brer Wolf. This old 
fellow told him all the news and also that he had since early morning been 
attempting to stalk a deer, but all in vain.

Then Monkey laid before him all the wonders of the bow and arrow that he 
carried on his back and assured him if he could but see the deer he would 
bring it down for him. When Wolf showed him the deer, Monkey was ready and 
down fell the deer.

They made a good meal together, but instead of Wolf being thankful, jealousy 
overmastered him and he begged for the bow and arrow. When Monkey refused to 
give it to him, he thereupon began to threaten him with his greater 
strength, and so when Jackal passed by, Wolf told him that Monkey had stolen 
his bow and arrow. After Jackal had heard both of them, he declared himself 
unqualified to settle the case alone, and he proposed that they bring the 
matter to the court of Lion, Tiger, and the other animals. In the meantime 
he declared he would take possession of what had been the cause of their 
quarrel, so that it would be safe, as he said. But he immediately brought to 
earth all that was eatable, so there was a long time of slaughter before 
Monkey and Wolf agreed to have the affair in court.

Monkey's evidence was weak, and to make it worse, Jackal's testimony was 
against him. Jackal thought that in this way it would be easier to obtain 
the bow and arrow from Wolf for himself.

And so fell the sentence against Monkey. Theft was looked upon as a great 
wrong; he must hang.

The fiddle was still at his side, and he received as a last favor from the 
court the right to play a tune on it.

He was a master player of his time, and in addition to this came the 
wonderful power of his charmed fiddle. Thus, when he struck the first note 
of "Cockcrow" upon it, the court began at once to show an unusual and 
spontaneous liveliness, and before he came to the first waltzing turn of the 
old tune the whole court was dancing like a whirlwind.

Over and over, quicker and quicker, sounded the tune of "Cockcrow" on the 
charmed fiddle, until some of the dancers, exhausted, fell down, although 
still keeping their feet in motion. But Monkey, musician as he was, heard 
and saw nothing of what had happened around him. With his head placed 
lovingly against the instrument, and his eyes half closed, he played on, 
keeping time ever with his foot.

Wolf was the first to cry out in pleading tones breathlessly, "Please stop, 
Cousin Monkey! For love's sake, please stop!"

But Monkey did not even hear him. Over and over sounded the resistless waltz 
of "Cockcrow."

After a while Lion showed signs of fatigue, and when he had gone the round 
once more with his young lion wife, he growled as he passed Monkey, "My 
whole kingdom is yours, ape, if you just stop playing."

"I do not want it," answered Monkey, "but withdraw the sentence and give me 
my bow and arrow, and you, Wolf, acknowledge that you stole it from me."

"I acknowledge, I acknowledge!" cried Wolf, while Lion cried, at the same 
instant, that he withdrew the sentence.

Monkey gave them just a few more turns of the "Cockcrow," gathered up his 
bow and arrow, and seated himself high up in the nearest camel thorn tree.

The court and other animals were so afraid that he might begin again that 
they hastily disbanded to new parts of the world.

THE TIGER, THE RAM, AND THE JACKAL
TIGER (leopard) was returning home from hunting on one occasion, when he 
lighted on the kraal of Ram. Now, Tiger had never seen Ram before, and 
accordingly, approaching submissively, he said, "Good day, friend! What may 
your name be?"

The other in his gruff voice, and striking his breast with his forefoot, 
said, "I am Ram. Who are you?"

"Tiger," answered the other, more dead than alive, and then, taking leave of 
Ram, he ran home as fast as he could.

Jackal lived at the same place as Tiger did, and the latter going to him, 
said, "Friend Jackal, I am quite out of breath, and am half dead with 
fright, for I have just seen a terrible looking fellow, with a large and 
thick head, and on my asking him what his name was, he answered, "I am Ram."

"What a foolish fellow you are," cried Jackal, "to let such a nice piece of 
flesh stand! Why did you do so? But we shall go to-morrow and eat it 
together."

Next day the two set off for the kraal of Ram, and as they appeared over a 
hill, Ram, who had turned out to look about him, and was calculating where 
he should that day crop a tender salad, saw them, and he immediately went to 
his wife and said, "I fear this is our last day, for Jackal and Tiger are 
both coming against us. What shall we do?"

"Don't be afraid," said the wife, "but take up the child in your arms, go 
out with it, and pinch it to make it cry as if it were hungry." Ram did so 
as the confederates came on.

No sooner did Tiger cast his eyes on Ram than fear again took possession of 
him, and he wished to turn back. Jackal had provided against this, and made 
Tiger fast to himself with a leathern thong, and said, "Come on," when Ram 
cried in a loud voice, and pinching his child at the same time, "You have 
done well, Friend Jackal, to have brought us Tiger to eat, for you hear how 
my child is crying for food."

On these dreadful words Tiger, notwithstanding the entreaties of Jackal to 
let him go, to let him loose, set off in the greatest alarm, dragayed Jackal 
after him over hill and valley, through bushes and over rocks, and never 
stopped to look behind him till he brought back himself and half-dead Jackal 
to his place again. And so Ram escaped.

THE JACKAL AND THE WOLF
ONCE on a time Jackal, who lived on the borders of the colony, saw a wagon 
returning from the seaside laden with fish; he tried to get into the wagon 
from behind, but he could not; he then ran on before and lay in the road as 
if dead. The wagon came up to him, and the leader cried to the driver, "Here 
is a fine kaross for your wife!"

"Throw it into the wagon," said the driver, and Jackal was thrown in.

The wagon traveled on, through a moonlight night, and all the while Jackal 
was throwing out the flsh into the road; he then jumped out himself and 
secured a great prize. But stupid old Wolf (hyena), coming by, ate more than 
his share, for which Jackal owed him a grudge, and he said to him, " You can 
get plenty of fish, too, if you lie in the way of a wagon as I did, and keep 
quite still whatever happens."

"So!" mumbled Wolf.

Accordingly, when the next wagon came from the sea, Wolf stretched himself 
out in the road.

"What ugly thing is this?" cried the leader, and kicked Wolf. He then took a 
stick and thrashed him within an inch of his life. Wolf, according to the 
directions of Jackal, lay quiet as long as he could; he then got up and 
bobbled off to tell his misfortune to Jackal, who pretended to comfort him.

"What a pity," said Wolf, "I have not got such a handsome skin as you have!"

A JACKAL AND A WOLF
JACKAL and Wolf went and hired themselves to a man to be his servants. In 
the middle of the night Jackal rose and smeared Wolf's tail with some fat, 
and then ate all the rest of it in the house. In the morning the man missed 
the fat, and he immediately accused Jackal of having eaten it. "Look at 
Wolf's tale," said the rogue, "and you will see who is the thief." The man 
did so, and then thrashed Wolf till he was nearly dead.

THE LION, THE JACKAL, AND THE MAN
IT so happened one day that Lion and Jackal came together to converse on 
affairs of land and state. Jackal, let me say, was the most important 
adviser to the king of the forest, and after they had spoken about these 
matters for quite a while, the conversation took a more personal turn.

Lion began to boast and talk big about his strength. Jackal had, perhaps, 
given him cause for it, because by nature he was a flatterer. But now that 
Lion began to assume so many airs, said he, "See here, Lion, I will show you 
an animal that is still more powerful than you are."

They walked along, Jackal leading the way, and met first a little boy.

"Is this the strong man?" asked Lion.

"No," answered Jackal, "he must still become a man, O king."

After a while they found an old man walking with bowed head and supporting 
his bent figure with a stick.

"Is this the wonderful strong man?" asked Lion.

"Not yet, O king," was Jackal's answer, "he has been a man."

Continuing their walk a short distance farther, they came across a young 
hunter, in the prime of youth, and accompanied by some of his dogs.

"There you have him now, O king," said Jackal. "Pit your strength against 
his, and if you win, then truly you are the strength of the earth."

Then Jackal made tracks to one side toward a little rocky kopje from which 
he would be able to see the meeting.

Growling, growling, Lion strode forward to meet the man, but when he came 
close the dogs beset him. He, however, paid but little attention to the 
dogs, pushed and separated them on all sides with a few sweeps of his front 
paws. They bowled aloud, beating a hasty retreat toward the man.

Thereupon the man fired a charge of shot, bitting him behind the shoulder, 
but even to this Lion paid but little attention. Thereupon the hunter pulled 
out his steel knife, and gave him a few good jabs. Lion retreated, followed 
by the flying bullets of the hunter.

"Well, are you strongest now?" was Jackal's first question when Lion arrived 
at his side.

"No, Jackal," answered Lion, "let that fellow there keep the name and 
welcome. Such as he I have never before seen. In the first place he had 
about ten of his bodyguard storm me. I really did not bother myself much 
about them, but when I attempted to turn him to chaff, he spat and blew fire 
at me, mostly into my face, that burned just a little but not very badly. 
And when I again endeavored to pull him to the ground he jerked out from his 
body one of his ribs with which he gave me some very ugly wounds, so bad 
that I had to make chips fly, and as a parting he sent some warm bullets 
after me. No, Jackal, give him the name."

THE WORLD'S REWARD
ONCE there was a man that had an old dog, so old that the, man desired to 
put him aside. The dog had served him very faithfully when he was still 
young, but ingratitude is the world's reward, and the man now wanted to 
dispose of him. The old dumb creature, however, ferreted out the plan of his 
master, and so at once resolved to go away of his own accord.

After he had walked quite a way he met an old bull in the veldt.

"Don't you want to go with me?" asked the dog.

"Where?" was the reply.

"To the land of the aged," said the dog, where troubles don't disturb you 
and thanklessness does not deface the deeds of man."

"Good," said the bull, "I am your companion."

The two now walked on and found a ram.

The dog laid the plan before him, and all moved off together, until they 
afterwards came successively upon a donkey, a cat, a cock, and a goose.

These joined their company, and the seven set out on their journey.

Late one night they came to a house and through the open door they saw a 
table spread with all kinds of nice food, of which some robbers were having 
their fill. It would help nothing to ask for admittance, and seeing that 
they were hungry, they must think of something else.

Therefore the donkey climbed up on the bull, the rain. on the donkev, the 
dog on the rain, the cat on the dog, the goose on the cat, and the cock on 
the goose, and with one accord they all let out terrible (threatening) 
noises (cryings).

The bull began to bellow, the donkey to bray, the dog to bark, the ram to 
bleat, the cat to mew, the goose to giggle gaggle, and the cock to crow, all 
without cessation.

The people in the house were frightened perfectly limp; they glanced out 
through the front door, and there they stared on the strange sight. Some of 
them took to the ropes over the back lower door, some disappeared through 
the window, and in a few counts the house was empty.

Then the seven old animals climbed down from one another, stepped into the 
house, and satisfied themselves with the delicious food.

But when they had finished, there still remained a great deal of food, too 
much to take with them on their remaining journey, and so together they 
contrived a plan to hold their position until the next day after breakfast.

The dog said, "See here, I am accustomed to watch at the front door of my 
master's house," and thereupon flopped himself down to sleep; the bull said, 
"I go behind the door," and there he took his position; the ram said, "I 
will go up on to the loft"; the donkey, "I at the middle door"; the cat, "I 
in the fireplace"; the goose, "I in the back door"; and the cock said, "I am 
going to sleep on the bed."

The captain of the robbers after a while sent one of his men back to see if 
these creatures had yet left the house.

The man came very cautiously into the neighborhood, listened and listened, 
but he heard nothing; he peeped through the window, and saw in the grate 
just two coals still glimmering, and thereupon started to walk through the 
front door.

There the old dog seized him by the leg. He jumped into the house, but the 
bull was ready, swept him up with his horns, and tossed him on to the loft. 
Here the ram received him and pushed him off the loft again. Reaching 
ground, he made for the middle door, but the donkey set up a terrible 
braying and at the same time gave him a kick that landed him in the 
fireplace, where the cat flew at him and scratched him nearly to pieces. He 
then jumped out through the back door, and here the goose got him by the 
trousers. When he was some distance away the cock crowed. He thereupon ran 
so that you could bear the stones rattle in the dark.

Purple and crimson and out of breath, he came back to his companions.

"Frightful, frightful!" was all that they could get from him at first, but 
after a while he told them.

"When I looked through the window I saw in the fireplace two bright coals 
shining, and when I wanted to go through the front door to go and look, I 
stepped into an iron trap. I jumped into the house, and there some one 
seized me with a fork and pitched me up on to the loft, there agam some one 
was ready, and threw me down on all fours. I wanted to fly through the 
middle door, but there some one blew on a trumpet, and smote me with a 
sledge hammer so that I did not know where I landed; but coming to very 
quickly, I found I was in the fireplace, and there another flew at me and 
scratched the eyes almost out of my bead. I thereupon fled out of the back 
door, and lastly I was attacked on the leg by the sixth with a pair of fire 
tongs, and when I was still running away, some one shouted out of the house,

Stop him, stop h-i-m!

THE LION AND JACKAL
NOT because he was exactly the most capable or progressive fellow in the 
neighborhood, but because he always gave that idea-that is why Jackal slowly 
acquired among the neighbors tbe name of a "progressive man." The truly 
well-bred people around him, who did not wish to hurt his feelings, seemed 
to apply this name to him, instead of, for instance, "cunning scamp," or 
"all-wise rat-trap," as so many others often dubbed him. He obtained this 
name of "a progressive man" because he spoke most of the time English, 
especially if he thought some of them were present who could not understand 
it, and also because he could always hold his body so much like a judge on 
public occasions.

He had a smooth tongue, could make quite a favorable speech, and especially 
with good effect could he expatiate on the backwardness of others. 
Underneath he really was the most unlettered man in the vicinity, but he had 
perfect control over his inborn cunningness, which allowed him for a long 
time to go triumphantly through life as a man of great ability.

One time, for instance, he lost his tail in an iron trap. He had long 
attempted to reach the Boer's goose pen, and had framed many good plans, but 
when he came to his senses, he was sitting in front of the goose pen with 
his tail in the iron trap, the dogs all the time coming for him. When he 
realized what it meant, he mustered together all his strength and pulled his 
tail, which he always thought so much of, clean off.

This would immediately have made him the butt of the whole neighborhood had 
he not thought of a plan. He called together a meeting of the jackals, and 
made them believe that Lion had issued a proclamation to the effect that all 
jackals in the future should be tailless, because their beautiful tails were 
a thorn in the eyes of more unfortunate animals.

In his smooth way he told them how he regretted that the king should have 
the barbaric right to interfere with his subjects. But so it was; and he 
thought the sooner he paid attention to it the safer. Therefore he had had 
his tail cut off already and he should advise all his friends to do the 
same. And so it happened that once all jackals for a long time were without 
tails. Later on they grew again.

It was about the same time that Tiger hired Jackal as a schoolmaster. Tiger 
was in those days the richest man in the surrounding country, and as he had 
had to suffer a great deal himself because he was so untutored, he wanted 
his children to have the best education that could be obtained.

It was shortly after a meeting, in which it was shown bow important a thing 
an education was, that Tiger approached Jackal and asked him to come and 
teach his children.

Jackal was very ready to do this. It was not exactly his vocation, he said, 
but he would do it to pass time and just out of friendship for his neighbor. 
His and Tiger's farm lands lay next each other.

That he did not make teaching his profession and that he possessed no degree 
was of no account in the eyes of Tiger.

"Do not praise my goodness so much, Cousin Jackal," laughed he. "We know 
your worth well enough. Much rather would I intrust my offspring to you than 
to the many so-called schoolmasters, for it is especially my wish, as well 
as that of their mother, to have our children obtain a progressive 
education, and to make such men and women of them that with the same ability 
as you have they can take their lawful places in this world."

"One condition," said Jackal, "I must state. It will be very inconvenient 
for me, almost impossible, to come here to your farm and hold school. My own 
farm would in that case go to pieces, and that I cannot let happen. It would 
never pay me."

Tiger answered that it was not exactly necessary either. In spite of their 
attachment to the little ones, they saw that it would probably be to their 
benefit to place them for a while in a stranger's house.

Jackal then told of his own bringing up by Wolf. He remembered well how 
small he was when his father sent him away to study with Wolf. Naturally, 
since then, he had passed through many schools, Wolf was only his first 
teacher. And only in his later days did he realize how much good it had done 
him.

"A man must bend the sapling while it is still young," said he. "There is no 
time that the child is so open to impressions as when he is plastic, about 
the age that most of your children are at present, and I was just thinking 
you would be doing a wise thing to send them away for quite a while."

He had, fortunately, just then a room in his house that would be suited for 
a schoolroom, and his wife could easily make some arrangement for their 
lodging, even if they had to enlarge their dwelling somewhat.

It was then and there agreed upon. Tiger's wife was then consulted about one 
thing and another, and the following day the children were to leave.

I have just thought of one more thing,"remarked Jackal, "seven children, 
besides my little lot, will be quite a care on our hands, so you will have 
to send over each week a fat lamb, and in order not to disturb their 
progress, the children will have to relinquish the idea of a vacation spent 
with you for some time. When I think they have become used to the bit, I 
will inform you, and then you can come and take them to make you a short 
visit, but not until then. "It is also better," continued he, "that they do 
not see you for the first while, but your wife can come and see them every 
Saturday and I will see to all else."

On the following day there was an unearthly howling and wailing when the 
children were to leave. But Tiger and their mother showed them that it was 
best and that some day they would see that it was all for their good, and 
that their parents were doing it out of kindness. Eventually they were gone.

The first Saturday dawned, and early that morning Mrs. Tiger was on her way 
to Jackal's dwelling, because she could not defer the time any longer.

She was still a long way off when Jackal caught sight of her. He always 
observed neighborly customs, and so stepped out to meet her.

After they had greeted each other, Mrs. Tiger's first question was: "Well, 
Cousin Jackal, how goes everything with the small team? Are they still all 
well and happy, and do they not trouble you, Cousin Jackal, too much?"

"Oh, my goodness, no, Mrs. Tiger,"answered Jackal enthusiastically, "but 
don't let us talk so loud, because if they beard you, it certainly would 
cause them many heartfelt tears and they might also want to go back with you 
and then all our trouble would have been for nothing."

"But I would like to see them, Cousin Jackal," said Mrs. Tiger a little 
disturbed.

"Why certainly, Mrs. Tiger," was his answer, "but I do not think it is wise 
for them to see you. I will lift them up to the window one by one, and then 
you can put your mind at rest concerning their health and progress."

After Mr. and Mrs. Jackal and Mrs. Tiger had sat together for some time 
drinking coffee and talking over one thing and another, Jackal took Tiger's 
wife to a door and told her to look through it, out upon the back yard. 
There he would show her the children one by one, while they would not be 
able to see her. Everything was done exactly as Jackal had said, but the 
sixth little tiger he picked up twice, because the firstborn he had the day 
before prepared in pickle for their Sunday meal.

And so it happened every Saturday until the last little tiger-which was the 
youngest-had to be lifted up seven times in succession.

And when Mrs. Tiger came again the following week all was still as death and 
everything seemed to have a deserted appearance on the estate. She walked 
straight to the front door, and there she found a letter in the poll grass 
near the door, which read thus:

"We have gone for a picnic with the children. From there we will ride by 
Jackalsdance for New Year. This is necessary for the completion of their 
progressive education."

Saturday after Saturday did Mrs. Tiger go and look, but every time Jackal's 
house seemed to look more deserted; and after a while there was a spider's 
web over the door and the trail of Snake showed that he, too, had taken up 
his abode there.

TINK-TINKJE
THE birds wanted a king. Men have a king, so have animals, and why shouldn't 
they? All had assembled.

"The Ostrich, because he is the largest," one called out.

"No, he can't fly."

"Eagle, on account of his strength."

"Not he, he is too ugly."

"Vulture, because he can fly the highest."

"No, Vulture is too dirty, his odor is terrible."

"Peacock, he is so beautiful."

"His feet are too ugly, and also his voice."

"Owl, because he can see well."

"Not Owl, he is ashamed of the light."

And so they got no further. Then one shouted aloud, "He who can fly the 
highest will be king." "Yes, yes," they all screamed, and at a given Signal 
they all ascended straight up into the sky.

Vulture flew for three whole days without stopping, straight toward the sun. 
Then he cried aloud, "I am the highest, I am king."

"T-sie, t-sie, t-sie," he heard above him. There Tink-tinkje was flying. He 
had held fast to one of the great wing feathers of Vulture, and had never 
been felt, he was so light. "T-sie, t-sie, t-sle, I am the highest, I am 
king," piped Tink-tinkje.

Vulture flew for another day still ascending. "I am highest, I am king."

"T-sie, t-sie, t-sie, I am the highest, I am king," Tink-tinkje mocked. 
There he was again, having crept out from under the wing of Vulture.

Vulture flew on the fifth day straight up in the air. "I am the highest, I 
am king," he called.

"T-sie, t-sie, t-sie," piped the little fellow above him. "I am the highest, 
I am king."

Vulture was tired and now flew direct to earth. The other birds were mad 
through and through. Tink-tinkje must die because he had taken advantage of 
Vulture's feathers and there hidden himself. All flew after him and he had 
to take refuge in a mouse hole. But how were they to get him out? Some one 
must stand guard to seize him the moment he put out his head.

"Owl must keep guard; he has the largest eyes; he can see well," they 
exclaimed.

Owl went and took up his position before the hole. The sun was warm and soon 
Owl became sleepy and presently he was fast asleep.

Tink-tinkje peeped, saw that Owl was asleep, and z-zip away he went. Shortly 
afterwards the other birds came to see if Tink-tinkje were still in the 
hole. "T-sie, t-sie," they heard in a tree; and there the little vagabond 
was sitting.

White-crow, perfectly disgusted, turned around and exclaimed,"Now I won't 
say a single word more." And from that day to this Whitecrow has never 
spoken. Even though you strike him, he makes no sound, he utters no cry.

THE LION AND JACKAL
LION had now caught a large eland which lay dead on the top of a high bank. 
Lion was thirsty and wanted to go and drink water. " Jackal, look after my 
eland, I am going to get a drink. Don't you eat any."

"Very well, Uncle Lion."

Lion went to the river and Jackal quietly removed a stone on which Lion had 
to step to reach the bank on his return. After that Jackal and his wife ate 
heartily of the eland. Lion returned, but could not scale the bank. " 
Jackal, help me," he shouted.

"Yes, Uncle Lion, I will let down a rope and then you can climb up."

Jackal whispered to his wife, "Give me one of the old, thin hide ropes." And 
then aloud he added, "Wife, give me one of the strong, buffalo ropes, so 
Uncle Lion won't fall."

His wife gave him an old rotten rope. Jackal and his wife first ate 
ravenously of the meat, then gradually let the rope down. Lion seized it and 
struggled up. When he neared the brink Jackal gave the rope a jerk. It broke 
and down Lion began to roll-rolled the whole way down, and finally lay at 
the foot near the river.

Jackal began to beat a dry hide that lay there as he howled, cried, and 
shouted: "Wife, why did you give me such a bad rope that caused Uncle Lion 
to fall? "

Lion heard the row and roared, "Jackal, stop beating your wife. I will hurt 
you if you don't cease. Help me to climb up."

"Uncle Lion, I will give you a rope." Whispering again to his wife, "Give me 
one of the old, thin hide ropes," and shouting aloud again, "Give me a 
strong, buffalo rope, wife, that will not break again with Lion."

Jackal gave out the rope, and when Lion had nearly reached the top, he cut 
the rope through. Snap! and Lion began to roll to the bottom. Jackal again 
beat on the hide and shouted, "Wife, why did you give me such a rotten rope? 
Didn't I tell you to give me a strong one? " Lion roared, "Jackal, stop 
beating your wife at once. Help me instantly or you will be sorry."

"Wife," Jackal said aloud, "give me now the strongest rope you have," and 
aside to her, "Give me the worst rope of the lot."

Jackal again let down a rope, but just as Lion reached the top, Jackal gave 
a strong tug and broke the rope. Poor old Lion rolled down the side of the 
hill and lay there roaring from pain. He had been fatally hurt.

Jackal inquired, "Uncle Lion, have you hurt yourself? Have you much pain? 
Wait a while, I am coming directly to help you." Jackal and his wife slowly 
walked away.

LION AND JACKAL
THE Lion and the Jackal agreed to hunt on shares, for the purpose of laying 
in a stock of meat for the winter months for their families.

As the Lion was by far the more expert hunter of the two, the Jackal 
suggested that he (himself) should be employed in transporting the game to 
their dens, and that Mrs. Jackal and the little Jackals should prepare and 
dry the meat, adding that they would take care that Mrs. Lion and her family 
should not want.

This was agreed to by the Lion, and the hunt commenced.

After a very successful hunt, which lasted for some time, the Lion returned 
to see his family, and also to enjoy, as he thought, a plentiful supply of 
his spoil; when, to his utter surprise, he found Mrs. Lion and all the young 
Lions on the point of death from sheer hunger, and in a mangy state. The 
Jackal, it appeared, had only given them a few entrails of the game, and in 
such limited quantities as barely to keep them alive; always telling them 
that they (i. e., the Lion and himself) had been most unsuccessful in their 
hunting; while his own family was reveling in abundance, and each member of 
it was sleek and fat.

This was too much for the Lion to bear. He immediately started off in a 
terrible fury, vowing certain death to the Jackal and all his family, 
wherever he should meet them. The Jackal was more or less prepared for a 
storm, and had taken the precaution to remove all his belongings to the top 
of a krantz (i. e., a cliff), accessible only by a most difficult and 
circuitous path, which he alone knew.

When the Lion saw him on the krantz, the Jackal immediately greeted him by 
calling out,

Good morning, Uncle Lion."

"How dare you call me uncle, you impudent scoundrel," roared out the Lion, 
in a voice of thunder," after the way in which you have behaved to my 
family?"

"Oh, Uncle! How shall I explain matters? That beast of a wife of mine!" 
Whack, whack was heard, as he beat with a stick on dry hide, which was a 
mere pretence for Mrs. Jackal's back; while that lady was preinstructed to 
scream whenever he operated on the hide, which she did with a vengeance, 
joined by the little Jackals, who set up a most doleful chorus. "That 
wretch!" said the Jackal. "It is all her doing. I shall kill her straight 
off," and away he again belabored the hide, while his wife and children 
uttered such a dismal howl that the Lion begged of him to leave off flogging 
his wife. After cooling down a little, he invited Uncle Lion to come up and 
have something to eat. The Lion, after several ineffectual attempts to scale 
the precipice, had to give it up.

The Jackal, always ready for emergencies, suggested that a reim should be 
lowered to haul up his uncle. This was agreed to, and when the Lion was 
drawn about halfway up by the whole family of Jackals, the reim was cleverly 
cut, and down went the Lion with a tremendous crash which hurt him very 
much. Upon this, the Jackal again performed upon the hide with tremendous 
force, for their daring to give him such a rotten reim, and Mrs. Jackal and 
the little ones responded with some fearful screams and yells. He then 
called loudly out to his wife for a strong buffalo reim which would support 
any weight. This again was lowered and fastened to the Lion, when all bands 
pulled away at their uncle; and, just when he had reached so far that he 
could look over the precipice into the pots to see all the fat meat cooking, 
and all the biltongs hanging out to dry, the reim was again cut, and the 
poor Lion fell with such force that he was fairly stunned for some time. 
After the Lion had recovered his senses, the Jackal, in a most sympathizing 
tone, suggested that he was afraid that it was of no use to attempt to haul 
him up onto the precipice, and recommended, instead, that a nice fat piece 
of eland's breast be roasted and dropped into the Lion's mouth. The Lion, 
half famished with hunger, and much bruised, readily accepted the offer, and 
sat eagerly awaiting the fat morsel.

In the mean time, the Jackal had a round stone made red-hot, and wrapped a 
quantity of inside fat, or suet, round it, to make it appear like a ball of 
fat. When the Lion saw it held out, he opened his capacious mouth to the 
utmost extent, and the wily Jackal cleverly dropped the hot ball right into 
it, which ran through the poor old beast, killing him on the spot.

It need hardly be told that there was great rejoicing on the precipice that 
night.

THE HUNT OF LION AND JACKAL
LION and Jackal, it is said, were one day lying in wait for Eland. Lion shot 
(with a bow) and missed, but Jackal hit and sang out, "Hah! hah!"

Lion said, "No, you did not shoot anything. It was I who hit."

Jackal answered, "Yea, my father, thou hast hit."

Then they went home in order to return when the eland was dead, and cut it 
up. Jackal, however, turned back, unknown to Lion, hit his nose so that the 
blood ran on the spoor of the eland, and followed their track thus, in order 
to cheat Lion. When he had gone some distance, he returned by another way to 
the dead eland, and creeping into its carcass, cut out all the fat.

Meanwhile Lion followed the blood-stained spoor of Jackal, thinking that it 
was eland blood, and only when he had gone some distance did he find out 
that he had been deceived. He then returned on Jackal's spoor, and reached 
the dead eland, where, finding Jackal in its carcass, he seized him by his 
tail and drew him out with a swing.

Lion upbraided Jackal with these words:

"Why do you cheat me?"

Jackal answered: "No, my father, I do not cheat you; you may know it, I 
think. I prepared this fat for you, father."

Lion said: "Then take the fat and carry it to your mother " (the lioness) ; 
and he gave him the lungs to take to his own wife and children.

When Jackal arrived, he did not give the fat to Lion's wife, but to his own 
wife and children; he gave, however, the lungs to Lion's wife, and he pelted 
Lion's little children with the lungs, saying:

"You children of the big-pawed one!
You big-pawed ones!"

He said to Lioness, "I go to help my father (the lion) ; but he went far 
away with his wife and children.

STORY OF LION AND LITTLE JACKAL
LITTLE JACKAL one day went out hunting, when he met Lion. Lion proposed that 
they should hunt together, on condition that if a small antelope was killed 
it was to be Little Jackal's, and if a large one was killed it was to be 
Lion's. Little Jackal agreed to this.

The first animal killed was a large eland. Lion was very glad, and said to 
Little Jackal: "I will continue hunting while you go to my house and call my 
children to carry the meat home."

Little Jackal replied: "Yes, I agree to that."

Lion went away to hunt. When he had gone, Little Jackal went to his own 
house and called his own children to carry away the meat. He said: "Lion 
takes me for a fool if he thinks I will call his children while my own are 
dying with hunger."

So Little Jackal's children carried the meat to their home on the top of a 
high rock, where the only way to get to their house was by means of a rope.

Lion caught nothing more, and after a time he went home and asked his wife 
where the meat was. She told him there was no meat. He said: "Did not Little 
Jackal bring a message to my children to carry meat? "

His wife replied: "No, he was not here. We are still dying with hunger."

Lion then went to Little Jackal's house, but he could not get up the rock to 
it. So he sat down by the water, waiting. After a time Little Jackal went to 
get some water. He was close to the water when he saw Lion. He at once ran 
away, and Lion ran after him. He ran into a hole under a tree, but Lion 
caught his tail before he got far in. He said to him: "That is not my tail 
you have hold of; it is a root of the tree. If you do not believe me, take a 
stone and strike it, and see if any blood comes."

Lion let go the tail, and went for a stone to prove what it was. While he 
was gone for the stone, Little Jackal went far into the hole. When Lion 
returned he could not be found. Lion lay down by the hole and waited. After 
a long time Little Jackal wanted to come out. He went to the entrance and 
looked round, but he could not see Lion. To make sure, he said: "Ho, I see 
you, my master, although you are in hiding."

Lion did not move from the place where he lay concealed. Then Little Jackal 
went out, and Lion pursued him, but he got away.

Lion watched for him, and one day, when Little Jackal was out hunting, he 
came upon him in a place where he could not escape. Lion was just about to 
spring upon him, when Little Jackal said softly: "Be still, do you not see 
that bushbuck on the other side of the rock? I am glad you have come to help 
me. Just remain here while I run round and drive him toward you."

Lion did so, and Little Jackal made his escape.

At another time there was a meeting of the animals, and Lion was the chief 
at the meeting. Little Jackal wanted to attend, but there was a law made 
that no one should be present unless he had horns. So Little Jackal took wax 
out of a nest of bees, and made horns for himself with it. He fastened the 
horns on his head, and went to the meeting. Lion did not know him on account 
of the horns. But he sat near the fire and went to sleep, when the horns 
melted.

Lion looked at him and saw who it was. He immediately tried to catch him, 
but Little Jackal was quick in springing away. He ran under an overhanging 
rock and sang out: "Help! help! this rock is falling upon me!"

Lion went for a pole to prop up the rock that he might get at Little Jackal. 
While he was away, Little Jackal escaped.

After that they became companions again, and went hunting another time. They 
killed an ox. Lion said: "I will watch it while you carry the pieces away."

Lion gave him the breast, and said: "Take this to my wife."

Little Jackal took it to his own wife. When he returned, Lion gave him a 
shin, and said:

"Take this to your wife."

Little Jackal took the shin to Lion's house. Lion's wife said: "I cannot 
take this because it should not come here."

Little Jackal thereupon struck Lion's wife in the face, and went back to the 
place where the ox was killed. Lion gave him a large piece of meat and said: 
"Take this to my wife."

Little Jackal took it to his own wife. This continued till the ox was 
flnished. Then they both went home. When Lion arrived at his house he found 
there was weeping in his family.

His wife said: "Is it you who sent Little Jackal to beat me and my children, 
and is it you who sent this shin? Did I ever eat a shin? "

When Lion heard this he was very angry and at once went to Little Jackal's 
house. When he reached the rock, Little Jackal looked down and said: "Who 
are you, and what is your name, and whose son are you, and where are you 
from, and where are you going to, and whom do you want, and what do you want 
him for?"

Lion replied: "I have merely come to see you. I wish you to let down the 
rope."

Little Jackal let down a rope made of mouse skins, and when Lion climbed a 
little way up, the rope broke, and he fell and was hurt. He then went home.

THE LIONESS AND THE OSTRICH
IT is said, once a lioness roared, and the ostrich also roared. The lioness 
went toward the place where the ostrich was. They met. The lioness said to 
the ostrich, "Please to roar." The ostrich roared. Then the lioness roared. 
The voices were equal. The lioness said to the ostrich, "You are my match."

Then the lioness said to the ostrich, "Let us hunt gaine together." They saw 
eland and made toward it. The lioness caught only one; the ostrich killed a 
great many by striking them with the claw which was on his leg; but the 
lioness killed only one. When they had met after the hunting they went to 
the game, and the lioness saw that the ostrich had killed a great deal.

Now, the lioness also had young cubs. They went to the shade to rest 
themselves. The lioness said to the ostrich, "Get up and rip open; let us 
eat." Said the ostrich, "Go and rip open; I shall eat the blood." The 
lioness stood up and ripped open, and ate with the cubs. And when she had 
eaten, the ostrich got up and ate the blood. They went to sleep.

The cubs played about. While they were playing, they went to the ostrich, 
who was asleep. When he went to sleep he also opened his mouth. The young 
lions saw that the ostrich had no teeth. They went to their mother and said, 
"This fellow, who says he is your equal, has no teeth; he is insulting you." 
Then the lioness went to wake the ostrich, and said, "Get up, let us fight"; 
and they fought. And the ostrich said, "Go to that side of the anthill, and 
I will go to this side of it." The ostrich struck the anthill, and sent it 
toward the lioness. But the second time he struck the lioness in a 
vulnerable spot, near the liver, and killed her.

CROCODILE'S TREASON
CROCODILE was, in the days when animals still could talk, the acknowledged 
foreman of all water creatures and if one should judge from appearances one 
would say that he still is. But in those days it was his especial duty to 
have a general care of all water animals, and when one year it was 
exceedingly dry, and the water of the river where they had lived dried up 
and became scarce, he was forced to make it plan to trek over to another 
river a short distance from there.

He first sent Otter out to spy. He stayed away two days and brought back a 
report that there was still good water in the other river, real sea-cow 
holes, that not even a drought of several years could dry up.

After he had ascertained this, Crocodile called to his side Tortoise and 
Alligator.

"Look here," said he, "I need you two tonight to carry a report to Lion. So 
then get ready; the veldt is dry, and you will probably have to travel for a 
few days without any water. We must make peace with Lion and his subjects, 
otherwise we utterly perish this year. And he must help us to trek over to 
the other river, especially past. the Boer's farm that lies in between, and 
to travel unmolested by any of the animals of the veldt, so long as the trek 
lasts. A fish on land is sometimes a very helpless thing, as you all know." 
The two had it mighty hard in the burning sun, and on the dry veldt, but 
eventually they reached Lion and handed him the treaty.

"What is going on now?" thought Lion to himself, when he had read it. "I 
must consult Jackal first," said he. But to the commissioners he gave back 
an answer that he would be the following evening with his advisers at the 
appointed place, at the big vaarland willow tree, at the farther end of the 
hole of water, where Crocodile had his headquarters.

When Tortoise and Alligator came back, Crocodile was exceedingly pleased 
with himself at the turn the case had taken.

He allowed Otter and a few others to be present and ordered them on that 
evening to have ready plenty of fish and other eatables for their guests 
under the vaarland willow.

That evening as it grew dark Lion appeared with Wolf, Jackal, Baboon, and a 
few other important animals, at the appointed place, and they were received 
in the most open-hearted manner by Crocodile and the other water creatures.

Crocodile was so glad at the meeting of the animals that he now and then let 
fall a great tear of joy that disappeared into the sand. After the other 
animals had done well by the fish, Crocodile laid bare to them the condition 
of affairs and opened up his plan. He wanted only peace among all animals; 
for they not only destroyed one another, but the Boer, too, would in time 
destroy them all.

The Boer had already stationed at the source of the river no less than three 
steam pumps to irrigate his land, and the water was becoming scarcer every 
day. More than this, he took advantage of their unfortunate position by 
making them sit in the shallow water and then, one after the other, bringing 
about their death. As Lion was, on this account, inclined to make peace, it 
was to his glory to take this opportunity and give his hand to these peace-
making water creatures, and carry out their part of the contract, namely, 
escort them from the dried-up water, past the Boer's farm and to the long 
sea-cow pools.

"And what benefit shall we receive from it?" asked Jackal.

"Well," answered Crocodile, "the peace made is of great benefit to both 
sides. We will not exterminate each other. If you desire to come and drink 
water, you can do so with an easy mind, and not be the least bit nervous 
that I, or any one of us will seize you by the nose; and so also with all 
the other animals. And from your side we are to be freed from Elephant, who 
has the habit, whenever he gets the opportunity, of tossing us with his 
trunk up into some open and narrow fork of a tree and there allowing us to 
become biltong."

Lion and Jackal stepped aside to consult with one another, and then Lion 
wanted to know what form of security he would have that Crocodile would keep 
to his part of the contract.

"I stake my word of honor," was the prompt answer from Crocodile, and he let 
drop a few more long tears of honesty into the sand.

Baboon then said it was all square and honest as far as he could see into 
the case. He thought it was nonsense to attempt to dig pitfalls for one 
another; because he personally was well aware that his race would benefit 
somewhat from this contract of peace and friendship. And more than this, 
they must consider that use must be made of the fast disappearing water, for 
even in the best of times it was an unpleasant thing to be always carrying 
your life about in your bands. He would, however, like to suggest to the 
King that it would be well to have everything put down in writing, so that 
there would be nothing to regret in case it was needed.

Jackal did not want to listen to the agreement. He could not see that it 
would benefit the animals of the veldt. But Wolf, who had fully satisfied 
himself with the fish, was in an exceptionally peace-loving mood, and he 
advised Lion again to close the agreement.

After Lion had listened to all his advisers, and also the pleading tones of 
Crocodile's followers, lie held forth in a speech in which he said that he 
was inclined to enter into the agreement, seeing that it was clear that 
Crocodile and his subjects were in a very tight place.

There and then a document was drawn up, and it was resolved, before 
midnight, to begin the trek. Crocodile's messengers swam in all directions 
to summon together the water animals for the trek.

Frogs croaked and crickets chirped in the long water grass. It was not long 
before all the animals had assembled at the vaarland willow. In the meantime 
Lion had sent out a few despatch riders to his subjects to raise a commando 
for an escort, and long ere midnight these also were at the vaarland willow 
in the moonlight.

The trek then was regulated by Lion and Jackal. Jackal was to take the lead 
to act as spy, and when he was able to draw Lion to one side, he said to 
him:

"See here, I do not trust this affair one bit, and I want to tell you 
straight out, I am going to make tracks! I will spy for you until you reach 
the sea-cow pool, but I am not going to be the one to await your arrival 
there."

Elephant had to act as advance guard because he could walk so softly and 
could hear and smell so well. Then came Lion with one division of the 
animals, then Crocodile's trek with a flank protection of both sides, and 
Wolf received orders to bring up the rear.

Meanwhile, while all this was being arranged, Crocodile was smoothly 
preparing his treason. He called Yellow Snake to one side and said to him: 
"It is to our advantage to have these animals, who go among us every day, 
and who will continue to do so, fall into the hands of the Boer. Listen, 
now! You remain behind unnoticed, and when you hear me shout you will know 
that we have arrived safely at the seacow pool. Then you must harass the 
Boer's dogs as much as you can, and the rest will look out for themselves."

Thereupon the trek moved on. It was necessary to go very slowly as many of 
the water animals were not accustomed to the journey on land; but they 
trekked past the Boer's farm in safety, and toward break of day they were 
all safely at the sea-cow pool. There most of the water animals disappeared 
suddenly into the deep water, and Crocodile also began to make preparations 
to follow their example. With tearful eyes he said to Lion that he was, oh, 
so thankful for the help, that, from pure relief and joy, he must first give 
vent to his feelings by a few screams. Thereupon he suited his words to 
actions so that even the mountains echoed, and then thanked Lion on behalf 
of his subjects, and purposely continued with a long speech, dwelling on all 
the benefits both sides would derive from the agreement of peace.

Lion was just about to say good day and take his departure, when the first 
shot fell, and with it Elephant and a few other animals.

"I told you all so!" shouted Jackal from the other side of the sea-cow pool. 
"Why did you allow yourselves to he misled by a few Crocodile tears? "

Crocodile had disappeared long ago into the water. All one saw was just a 
lot of bubbles; and on the banks there was an actual war against the 
animals. It simply crackled the way the Boers shot them.

But most of them, fortunately, came out of it alive.

Shortly after, they say, Crocodile received his well-earned reward, when he 
met a driver with a load of dynamite. And even now when the Elephant gets 
the chance he pitches them up into the highest forks of the trees.

THE STORY OF A DAM
HERE was a great drought in the land; and Lion called together a number of 
animals so that they might devise a plan for retaining water when the rains 
fell.

The animals which attended at Lion's summons were Baboon, Leopard, Hyena, 
Jackal, Hare, and Mountain Tortoise.

It was agreed that they should scratch a large hole in some suitable place 
to hold water; and the next day they all began to work, with the exception 
of Jackal, who continually hovered about in that locality, and was overheard 
to mutter that he was not going to scratch his nails off in making water 
holes.

When the dam was finished the rains fell, and it was soon filled with water, 
to the great delight of those who had worked so bard at it. The first one, 
however, to come and drink there, was Jackal, who not only drank, but filled 
his clay pot with water, and then proceeded to swim in the rest of the 
water, making it as muddy and dirty as he could.

This was brought to the knowledge of Lion. who was very angry and ordered 
Baboon to guard the water the next day, armed with a huge knobkirrie. Baboon 
was concealed in a bush close to the water; but Jackal soon became aware of 
his presence there, and guessed its cause. Knowing the fondness of baboons 
for honey, Jackal at once hit upon a plan, and marching to and fro, every 
now and then dipped his fingers into his clay pot, and licked them with an 
expression of intense relish, saying, in a. low voice to himself, "I don't 
want any of their dirty water when I have a pot full of delicious honey." 
This was too much for poor Baboon, whose mouth began to water. He soon began 
to beg Jackal to give him a little honey, as he had been watching for 
several hours, and was very hungry and tired.

After taking no notice of Baboon at first, Jackal looked round, and said, in 
a patronizing manner, that he pitied such an unfortunate creature, and would 
give him some honey on certain conditions, viz., that Baboon should give up 
his knobkirrie and allow himself to be bound by Jackal. He foolishly agreed; 
and was soon tied in such a manner that he could not move hand or foot.

Jackal now proceeded to drink of the water, to fill his pot, and to swim in 
the sight of Baboon, from time to time telling him what a foolish fellow he 
had been to be so easily duped, and that he (Jackal) had no honey or 
anything else to give him, excepting a good blow on the head every now and 
then with his own knobkirrie.

The animals soon appeared and found poor Baboon in this sorry plight, 
looking the picture of misery. Lion was so exasperated that he caused Baboon 
to be severely punished, and to be denounced as a fool.

Tortoise hereupon stepped forward, and offered his services for the capture 
of Jackal. It was at flrst thought that he was merely joking; but when he 
explained in what manner he proposed to catch him, his plan was considered 
so feasible that his offer was accepted. He proposed that a thick coating of 
"bijenwerk" (a kind of sticky black substance found on beehives) should be 
spread all over him, and that he should then go and stand at the entrance of 
the dam, on the water level, so that Jackal might tread upon him and stick 
fast. This was accordingly done and Tortoise posted there.

The next day, when Jackal came, he approacbed the water very cautiously, and 
wondered to find no one there. He then ventured to the entrance of the 
water, and remarked how kind they had been in placing there a large black 
stepping-stone for him. As soon, however, as he trod upon the supposed 
stone, he stuck fast, and saw that he had been tricked; for Tortoise now put 
his head out and began to move. Jackal's bind feet being still free he 
threatened to smash Tortoise with them if he did not let him go. Tortoise 
merely answered, "Do as you like." Jackal thereupon made a violent jump, and 
found, with horror, that his hind feet were now also fast. "Tortoise," said 
he, "I have still my mouth and teeth left, and will eat you alive if you do 
not let me go." "Do as you like," Tortoise again replied. Jackal, in his 
endeavors to free himself, at last made a desperate bite at Tortoise, and 
found himself fixed, both head and feet. Tortoise, feeling proud of his 
successful capture, now marched quietly up to the top of the bank with 
Jackal on his back, so that he could easily be seen by the animals as they 
came to the water.

They were indeed astonished to find how cleverly the crafty Jackal had been 
caught; and Tortoise was much praised, while the unhappy Baboon was again 
reminded of his misconduct when set to guard the water.

Jackal was at once condemned to death by Lion; and Hyena was to execute the 
sentence. Jackal pleaded hard for mercy, but finding this useless, he made a 
last request to Lion (always, as he said, so fair and just in his dealings) 
that he should not have to suffer a lingering death.

Lion inquired of him in what manner he wished to die; and he asked that his 
tail might be shaved and rubbed with a little fat, and that Hyena might then 
swing him round twice. and dash his brains out upon a stone. This, being 
considered sufficiently fair by Lion, was ordered by him to be carried out 
in his presence.

When Jackal's tail had been shaved and greased, Hyena caught hold of him 
with great force, and before he had fairly lifted him from the ground, the 
cunning Jackal had slipped away from Hyena's grasp, and was running for his 
life, pursued by all the animals.

Lion was the foremost pursuer, and after a great chase Jackal got under an 
overhanging precipice, and, standing on his hind legs with his shoulders 
pressed against the rock, called loudly to Lion to help him, as the rock was 
falling, and would crush them both. Lion put his shoulders to the rock, and 
exerted himself to the utmost. After some little time Jackal proposed that 
he should creep slowly out, and fetch a large pole to prop up the rock, so 
that Lion could get out and save his life. Jackal did creep out, and left 
Lion there to starve and die.

THE DANCE FOR WATER OR RABBIT'S TRIUMPH
THERE was a frightful drought. The rivers after a while dried tip and even 
the springs gave no water.

The animals wandered around seeking drink, but to no avail. Nowhere was 
water to be found.

A great gathering of animals was held: Lion, Tiger, Wolf, Jackal, Elephant, 
all of them came together. What was to be done? That was the question. One 
had this plan, and another had that; but no plan seemed of value.

Finally one of them suggested: "Come, let all of us go to the dry river bed 
and dance; in that way we can tread out the water."

Good! Everyone was satisfied and ready to begin instantly, excepting Rabbit, 
who said, "I will not go and dance. All of you are mad to attempt to get 
water from the ground by dancing."

The other animals danced and danced, and ultimately danced the water to the 
surface. How glad they were. Everyone drank as much as he could, but Rabbit 
did not dance with them. So it was decided that Rabbit should have no water.

He laughed at them: "I will nevertheless drink some of your water."

That evening he proceeded leisurely to the river bed where the dance had 
been, and drank as much as he wanted. The following morning the animals saw 
the footprints of Rabbit in the ground, and Rabbit shouted to them: "Aha! I 
did have some of the water, and it was most refreshing and tasted fine."

Quickly all the animals were called together. What were they to do? How were 
they to get Rabbit in their hands? All had some means to propose; the one 
suggested this, and the other that.

Finally old Tortoise moved slowly forward, foot by foot: "I will catch 
Rabbit."

"You? How? What do you think of yourself?" shouted the others in unison.

"Rub my shell with pitch,[1] and I will go to the edge of the water and lie 
down. I will then resemble a stone, so that when Rabbit steps on me his feet 
will stick fast."

"Yes! Yes! That's good."

And in a one, two, three, Tortoise's shell was covered with pitch, and foot 
by foot he moved away to the river. At the edge, close to the water, he lay 
down and drew his head into his shell.

Rabbit during the evening came to get a drink. "Ha!" he chuckled 
sarcastically," they are, after all, quite decent. Here they have placed a 
stone, so now I need not unnecessarily wet my feet."

Rabbit trod with his left foot on the stone, and there it stuck. Tortoise 
then put his head out. "Ha! old Tortoise! And it's you, is it, that's 
holding me. But here I still have another foot. I'll give you a good clout." 
Rabbit gave Tortoise what he said he would with his right fore foot, hard 
and straight; and there his foot remained.

[1. Black beeswax.]

"I have yet a hind foot, and with it I'll kick you." Rabbit drove his bind 
foot down. This also rested on Tortoise where it struck.

"But still another foot remains, and now I'll tread you." He stamped his 
foot down, but it stuck like the others.

He used his head to hammer Tortoise, and his tail as a whip, but both met 
the same fate as his feet, so there he was tight and fast down to the pitch.

Tortoise now slowly turned himself round and foot by foot started for the 
other animals, with Rabbit on his back.

"Ha! ha! ha! Rabbit! How does it look now? Insolence does not pay after 
all," shouted the animals.

Now advice was sought. What should they do with Rabbit? He certainly must 
die. But how? One said, "Behead him"; another, "Some severe penalty."

"Rabbit, how are we to kill you?"

"It does not affect me," Rabbit said. "Only a shameful death please do not 
pronounce."

"And what is that?" they all shouted.

"To take me by my tail and dash my head against a stone; that I pray and 
beseech you don't do."

"No, but just so you'll die. That is decided."

It was decided Rabbit should die by taking him by his tail and dashing his 
head to pieces against some stone. But who is to do it?

Lion, because he is the most powerful one.

Good! Lion should do it. He stood up, walked to the front, and poor Rabbit 
was brought to him. Rabbit pleaded and beseeched that he couldn't die such a 
miserable death.

Lion took Rabbit firmly by the tail and swung him around. The white skin 
slipped off from Rabbit, and there Lion stood with the white bit of skin and 
hair in his paw. Rabbit was free.

JACKAL AND MONKEY
EVERY evening Jackal went to the Boer's kraal. He crept through the sliding 
door and stole a fat young lamb. This, clever Jackal did several times in 
succession. Boer set a wip[1] for him at the door. Jackal went again and 
zip-there he was caught aroumd the body by the noose. He swung and swayed 
high in the air and couldn't touch ground. The day began to dawn and Jackal 
became uneasy.

On a stone kopje, Monkey sat. When it became light he could see the whole 
affair, and descended hastily for the purpose of mocking Jackal. He went and 
sat on the wall. "Ha,

[1. Wip: A Dutch word for springle, consisting of a bent green stick, to 
which a noose is attached at one end; the trap is delicately adjusted by a 
cross stick, which when trod on releases the bent bough, pulling the noose 
quickly around the animal and into the air.]

ha, good morning. So there you are hanging now, eventually caught."

"What? I caught? I am simply swinging for my pleasure; it is enjoyable."

"You fibber. You are caught in the wip."

"If you but realized how nice it was to swing and sway like this, you 
wouldn't hesitate. Come, try it a little. You feel so healthy and strong for 
the day, and you never tire afterwards."

"No, I won't. You are caught."

After a while Jackal convinced Monkey. He sprang from the kraal wall, and 
freeing Jackal, adjusted the noose around his own body. Jackal quickly let 
go and began to laugh, as Monkey was now swinging high in the air.

"Ha, ha, ha," he laughed. "Now Monkey is in the wip."

"Jackal, free me," he screamed.

"There, Boer is coming," shouted Jackal.

"Jackal, free me of this, or I'll break your playthings."

"No, there Boer is coming with his gun; you rest a while in the noose."

"Jackal, quickly make me free."

"No, here's Boer already, and he's got his gun. Good morning." And with 
these parting words he ran away as fast as he could. Boer came and saw 
Monkey in the wip.

"So, so, Monkey, now you are caught. You are the fellow who has been 
stealing my lambs, hey? "

"No, Boer, no," screamed Monkey, " not I, but Jackal."

"No, I know you; you aren't too good for that."

"No, Boer, no, not I, but Jackal," Monkey stammered.

"Oh, I know you. Just wait a little," and Boer, raising his gun, aimed and 
shot poor Monkey dead.

LION'S SHARE
LION and Jackal went together a-hunting. They shot with arrows. Lion shot 
first, but his arrow fell short of its aim; but Jackal hit the game, and 
joyfully cried out, "It has hit."

Lion looked at him with his two large eyes; Jackal, however, did not lose 
his countenance, but said, "No, uncle, I mean to say that you have hit." 
Then they followed the game, and Jackal passed the arrow of Lion without 
drawing the latter's attention to it. When they arrived at a crossway, 
Jackal said: "Dear uncle, you are old and tired; stay here." Jackal went 
then on a wrong track, beat his nose, and, in returning, let the blood drop 
from it like traces of game." I could not find anything," he said, "but I 
met with traces of blood. You had better go yourself to look for it. In the 
meantime I shall go this other way."

Jackal soon found the killed animal, crept inside of it, and devoured the 
best portion; but his tail remained outside, and when Lion arrived, he got 
hold of it, pulled Jackal out, and threw him on the ground with these words:

"You rascal! "

Jackal rose quickly again, complained of the rough handling, and asked, " 
What have I now done, dear uncle? I was busy cutting out the best part."

"Now let us go and fetch our wives," said Lion, but Jackal entreated his 
dear uncle to remain at the place because he was old. Jackal then went away, 
taking with him two portions of the flesh, one for his own wife, but the 
best part for the wife of Lion. When Jackal arrived with the flesh, the 
children of Lion, seeing him, began to jump, and clapping their hands, cried 
out: "There comes cousin with flesh!" Jackal threw, grumbling, the worst 
portion to them, and said, "There, you brood of the big-eyed one!" Then he 
went to his own house and told his wife immediately to break up the house, 
and to go where the killed game was. Lioness wished to do the same, but he 
forbade her, and said that Lion would himself come to fetch her.

When Jackal, with his wife and children, arrived in the neigliborhood of the 
killed animal, he ran into a thorn bush, scratched his face so that it bled, 
and thus made his appearance before Lion, to whom he said, "Ah! what a wife 
you have got. Look here, how she scratched my face when I told her that she 
should come with us. You must fetch her yourself; I cannot bring her." Lion 
went home very angry. Then Jackal said, "Quick, let us build a tower." They 
heaped stone upon stone, stone upon stone, stone upon stone; and when it was 
high enough, everything was carried to the top of it. When Jackal saw Lion 
approaching with his wife and childrcn, he cried out to him:

"Uncle, whilst you were away we have built a tower, in order to be better 
able to see game."

"All right," said Lion; "but let me conie up to you,"

Certainly, dear uncle; but how will you manage to come up? We must let down 
a thong for you."

Lion tied the thong around his body and Jackal began drawing him up, but 
when nearly to the top Jackal cried to Lion, "My, uncle, how heavy you are!" 
Then, unseen by Lion, he cut the thong. Lion fell to the ground, while 
Jackal began loudly and angrily to scold his wife, and then said, " Go, 
wife, fetch me a new thong"-"an old one," he said aside to her.

Lion again tied himself to the thong, and, just as he was near the top, 
Jackal cut the thong as before; Lion fell heavily to the bottom, groaning 
aloud, as he had been seriously hurt.

"No," said Jackal, "that will never do; you must, however, manage to come up 
high enough so that you may get a mouthful at least." Then aloud he ordered 
his wife to prepare a good piece, but aside he told her to make a stone hot, 
and to cover it with fat. Then he drew Lion up once more, and complaining 
how heavy he was to hold, told him to open his mouth, and thereupon threw 
the hot stone down his throat. Lion fell to the ground and lay there 
pleading for water, while Jackal climbed down and made his escape.

JACKAL'S BRIDE
JACKAL, it is said, married Hyena, and carried off a cow belonging to the 
ants, to slaughter her for the wedding; and when he had slaughtered her, he 
put the cowskin over his bride; and when he had fixed a pole (on which to 
bang the flesh), he placed on the top of the pole (which was forked) the 
hearth for the cooking, in order to cook upon it all sorts of delicious 
food. There came also Lion, and wished to go up. Jackal, therefore, asked 
his little daughter for a thong with which he could pull Lion up; and he 
began to pull him up; and when his face came near to the cooking-pot, he cut 
the thong in two, so that Lion tumbled down. Then Jackal upbraided his 
little daughter with these words: "Why do you give me such an old thong?" 
And he added, "Give me a fresh thong." She gave him a new thong, and he 
pulled Lion up again, and when his face came near the pot, which stood on 
the fire, he said, "open your mouth." Then he put into his mouth a hot piece 
of quartz which had been boiled together with the fat, and the stone went 
down, burning his throat. Thus died Lion.

There came also the ants running after the cow, and when Jackal saw them he 
fled. Then they beat the bride in her brookaross dress. Hyena, believing 
that it was Jackal, said:

"You tawny rogue! have you not played at beating long enough? Have you no 
more loving game than this?"

But when she had bitten a hole through the cowskin, she saw that they were 
other people; then she fled, falling here and there, yet made her escape.

THE STORY OF HARE
ONCE upon a time the animals made a kraal and put some fat in it. They 
agreed that one of their number should remain to be the keeper of the gate. 
The first one that was appointed was the coney (imbila). He agreed to take 
charge, and all the others went away. In a short time the coney fell asleep, 
when the inkalimeva (a fabulous animal) went in and ate all the fat. After 
doing this, he threw a little stone at the coney.

The coney started up and cried out: "The fat belonging to all the animals 
has been eaten by the inkalimeva."

It repeated this cry several times, calling out very loudly. The animals at 
a distance heard it, they ran to the kraal, and when they saw that the fat 
was gone they killed the coney.

They put fat in the kraal a second time, and appointed the muishond (ingaga) 
to keep the gate. The muishond consented, and the animals went away as 
before. After a little time the inkalimeva came to the kraal, bringing some 
honey with it. It invited the keeper of the gate to eat honey, and while the 
muishond was enjoying himself the inkalimeva went in and stole all the fat. 
It threw a stone at the muisbond, which caused him to look up.

The muishond cried out: "The fat belonging to all the animals has been eaten 
by the inkalimeva."

As soon as the animals beard the cry, they ran to the kraal and killed the 
muishond.

They put fat in the kraal a third time, and appointed the duiker (impunzi) 
to be the keeper of the gate. The duiker agreed, and the others went away. 
In a short time the inkalimeva made its appearance. It proposed to the 
duiker that they should play hide and look for. The duiker agreed to this. 
Then the inkalimeva hid itself, and the duiker looked for it till he was so 
tired that he lay down and went to sleep. When the duiker was asleep, the 
inkalimeva ate up all the fat.

Then it threw a stone at the dulker, which caused him to jump up and cry 
out: "The fat belonging to all the animals has been eaten by the 
inkalimeva."

The animals, when they heard the cry, ran to the kraal and killed the 
duiker.

They put fat in the kraal the fourth fline, and appointed the bluebuck 
(inputi) to be the keeper of the gate. When the aninials went away, the 
inkalineva came as before.

It said: "What are you doitig by yourself?"

The bluebuck answered: "I am watching the fat belonging to all the animals."

The inkalimeva said: "I will be your companion. Come, let us scratch each 
other's heads."

The bluebuck agreed to this. The inkalimeva sat down and scratched the head 
of the other till he went to sleep. Then it arose and ate all the fat. When 
it had finished, it threw a stone at the bluebuck and awakened him.

The bluebuck saw what had happened and cried out: "The fat belonging to all 
the animals has been eaten by the inkalinieva."

Then the animals ran up and killed the bluebuck also.

They put fat in the kraal the fifth time, and appointed the porcupine 
(incanda) to be the keeper of the gate. The animals went away, and the 
inkalimeva came as before.

It said to the porcupine, "Let us run a race against each other."

It let the porcupine beat in this race.

Then it said, "I did not think you could run so fast, but let us try again." 
They ran again, and it allowed the porcupine to beat the second time. They 
ran till the porcupine was so tired that he said, "Let us rest now."

They sat down to rest, and the porcupine went to sleep. Then the inkalimeva 
rose up and ate all the fat. When it had finished eating, it threw a stone 
at the porcupine, which caused him to jump up.

He called out with a loud voice, "The fat belonging to all the animals has 
been eaten by the inkalimeva."

Then the animals came running up and put the porcupine to death.

They put fat in the kraal the sixth time, and selected the hare (umvundla) 
to be the keeper of the gate. At first the hare would not consent.

He said, "The coney is dead, and the muisbond is dead, and the duiker is 
dead, and the bluebuck is dead, and the porcupine is dead, and you will kill 
me also."

They promised him that they would not kill him, and after a good deal of 
persuasion he at last agreed to keep the gate. When the animals were gone he 
laid himself down, but he only pretended to be asleep.

In a short time the inkalimeva went in, and was just going to take the fat 
when the hare cried out: "Let the fat alone."

The inkalimeva said, "Please let me have this little bit only."

The hare answered, mocking, "Please let me have this little bit only."

After that they became companions. The hare proposed that they should fasten 
each other's tail, and the inkalimeva agreed. The inkalimeva fastened the 
tail of the hare first.

The hare said, "Don't tie my tail so tight." Then the hare fastened the tail 
of the inkalimeva.

The inkalimeva said, "Don't tie my tail so tight," but the hare made no 
answer. After tying the tail of the inkalinieva very fast, the hare took his 
club and killed it. The hare took the tail of the inkalimeva and ate it, all 
except a little piece which he hid in the fence.

Then he called out, "The fat belonging to all the animals has been eaten by 
the inkalimeva."

The animals came running back, and when they saw that the inkalimeva was 
dead they rejoiced greatly. They asked the hare for the tail, which should 
be kept for the chief.

The hare replied, "The one I killed had no tail."

They said, "How can an inkalimeva be without a tail? "

They began to search, and at length they found a piece of the tail in the 
fence. They told the chief that the hare had eaten the tail.

He said, "Bring him to me!"

All the animals ran after the hare, but he fled, and they could not catch 
him. The hare ran into a hole, at the mouth of which the animals set a 
snare, and then went away. The hare remained in the hole for many days, but 
at length he managed to get out without being caught.

He went to a place where he found a bushbuck (imbabala) building a hut. 
There was a pot with meat in it on the fire.

He said to the bushbuck, Can I take this little piece of meat? "

The bushbuck answered, "You must not do it."

But he took the meat and ate it all. Afterwards he whistled in a particular 
manner, and there fell a storm of hail which killed the bushbuck. Then he 
took the skin of the bushbuck, and made for himself a mantle.

After this the hare went into the forest to procure some weapons to fight 
with. While he was cutting a stick the monkeys threw leaves upon him. He 
called to them to come down and beat him. They came down, but he killed them 
all with his weapons.

THE WHITE MAN AND SNAKE
A WHITE MAN, it is said, met Snake upon whom a large stone had fallen and 
covered her so that she could not rise. The White Man lifted the stone off 
Snake, but when he had done so, she wanted to bite him. The White Man said, 
" Stop! let us both go first to some wise people." They went to Hyena, and 
the White Man asked him, "Is it right that Snake should want to bite me, 
when I helped her as she lay under a stone and could not rise?"

Hyena (who thought he would get his share of the White Man's body) said, "If 
you were bitten what would it matter?"

Then Snake wanted to bite him, but the White Man said again, "Wait a little, 
and let us go to other wise people, that I may hear whether this is right."

They went and met Jackal. The White Man said to Jackal, "Is it right for 
Snake to want to bite me, when I lifted up the stone which lay upon her?"

Jackal replied, "I do not believe that Snake could be covered by a stone so 
she could not rise. Unless I saw it with my two eyes, I would not believe 
it. Therefore, come let us go and see the place where you say it happened 
whether it can be true."

They went, and arrived at the place where it had happened. Jackal said, 
"Snake, lie down, and let thyself be covered."

Snake did so, and the White Man covered her with the stone; but although she 
exerted herself very much, she could not rise. Then the White Man wanted 
again to release Snake, but Jackal interfered, and said, "Do not lift the 
stone. She wanted to bite you, therefore she may rise by herself."

Then they both went away and left Snake under the stone.

ANOTHER VERSION OF THE SAME FABLE
A DUTCHMAN was walking by himself and saw Snake lying under a large :stone. 
Snake implored his help; but when she had become free she said, "Now I shall 
eat you."

The Man answered, "That is not right. Let us first go to Hare."

When Hare had heard the affair, he said, "It is right."

"No," said the Man, "let us ask Hyena."

Hyena declared the same, saying, "It is right."

"Now let us ask Jackal," said the Man in his despair.

Jackal answered very slowly and consider ately, doubting the whole affair, 
and demanding to see first the place, and whether the Man was able to lift 
the stone. Snake lay down, and the Man, to prove the truth of his account, 
put the stone again over her.

When she was fast, Jackal said, "Now let her lie there."

CLOUD-EATING
JACKAL and Hyena were together, it is said, when a white cloud rose. Jackal 
descended upon it, and ate of the cloud as if it were fat.

When he wanted to come down, he said to Hyena, "My sister, as I ain going to 
divide with thee, catch me well." So she caught him, and broke his fall. 
Then she also went up and ate there, high up on the top of the cloud.

When she was satisfied, she said, "My greyish brother, now catch me. well." 
The greyish rogue said to his friend, "My sister, I shall catch thee well. 
Come therefore down."

He held up his hands, and she came down from the cloud, and when she was 
near, Jackal cried out (painfully jumping to one side), "My sister, do not 
take it ill. Oh me! Oh me! A thorn has pricked me and sticks in me."Thus she 
fell down from above, and was sadly hurt.

Since that day, it is said that Hyena's hind feet have been shorter and 
smaller than the front ones.

LION'S ILLNESS
LION, it is said, was ill, and they all went to see him in his suffering. 
But Jackal did not go, because the traces of the people who went to see him 
did not turn back. Thereupon, he was accused by Hyena, who said, "Though I 
go to look, yet Jackal does not want to come and look at the man's 
sufferings."

Then Lion let Hyena go, in order that she might catch Jackal; and she did 
so, and brought him.

Lion asked Jackal: "Why did you not come here to see me?"

Jackal said, "Oh, no! when I heard that my uncle was so very ill, I went to 
the witch (doctor) to consult him, whether and what medicine would be good 
for my uncle against the pain. The doctor said to me, 'Go and tell your 
uncle to take hold of Hyena and draw off her skin, and put it on while it is 
still warm. Then he will recover.' Hyena is one who does not care for my 
uncle's sufferings."

Lion followed his advice, got hold of Hyena, drew the skin over her cars, 
whilst she howled with all her might, and put it on.

JACKAL, DOVE, AND HERON
JACKAL, it is said, came once to Dove, who lived on the top of a rock, and 
said, "Give me one of your little ones."

Dove answered, "I shall not do anything of the kind."

Jackal said, "Give me it at once! Otherwise, I shall fly up to you." Then 
she threw one down to him.

He came back another day and demanded another little one, and she gave it to 
him. After Jackal had gone, Heron came, and asked,

Dove, why do you cry? "

Dove answered him, "Jackal has taken away my little ones; it is for this 
that I cry." He asked her, In what manner did he take them?" She answered 
him, "When he asked me I refused him; but when he said, 'I shall at once fly 
up, therefore give me it,' I threw it down to him."

Heron said, "Are you such a fool as to give your young ones to Jackal, who 
cannot fly?" Then, with the admonition to give no more, he went away.

Jackal came again, and said, "Dove, give me a little one." Dove refused, and 
told him that Heron had told her that he could not fly up. Jackal said, "I 
shall catch him."

So when Heron came to the banks of the water, Jackal asked him: "Brother 
Heron, when the wind comes from this side, how will you stand?" He turned 
his neck towards him and said, "I stand thus, bending my neck on one side." 
Jackal asked him again, "When a storm comes and when it rains, how do you 
stand?" He said to him: "I stand thus, indeed, bending my neck down."

Then Jackal beat him on his neck, and broke his neck in the middle.

Since that day Heron's neck is bent.

COCK AND JACKAL
COCK, it is said, was once overtaken by Jackal, and caught. Cock said to 
Jackal, "Please, pray first (before you kill me), as the white man does."

Jackal asked, "In what manner does he pray? Tell me."

"He folds his bands in praying," said Cock. Jackal folded his hands and 
prayed. Then Cock spoke again: "You ought not to look about you as you do. 
You had better shut your eyes." He did so; and Cock flew away, upbraiding at 
the same time Jackal with these words, "You rogue! do you also pray? "

There sat Jackal, speechless, because he had been outdone.

ELEPHANT AND TORTOISE
TWO powers, Elephant and Rain, had a dispute. Elephant said, "If you say 
that you nourish me, in what way is it that you do so?" Rain answered, "If 
you say that I do not nourish you, when I go away, will you not die? And 
Rain then departed.

Elephant said, "Vulture! cast lots to make rain for me."

Vulture said, "I will not cast lots."

Then Elephant said to Crow, "Cast lots! who answered, "Give the things with 
which I may cast lots." Crow cast lots and rain fell. It rained at the 
lagoons, but they dried up, and only one lagoon remained.

Elephant went a-hunting. There was, however, Tortoise, to whom Elephant 
said, "Tortoise, remain at the water!" Thus Tortoise was left behind when 
Elephant went a-hunting.

There came Giraffe, and said to Tortoise, "Give me water!" Tortoise 
answered, "The water belongs to Elephant."

There came Zebra, who said to Tortoise,

"Give me water!" Tortoise answered, "The water belongs to Elephant."

There came Gemsbok, and said to Tortoise,

"Give me water!" Tortoise answered, "The water belongs to Elephant."

There came Wildebeest, and said, "Give me water!" Tortoise said, "The water 
belongs to Elephant."

There came Roodebok, and said to Tortoise,

"Give me water!" Tortoise answered, "The water belongs to Elephant."

There came Springbok, and said to Tortoise,

"Give me water!" Tortoise said, "The water belongs to Elephant."

There came Jackal, and said to Tortoise,

"Give me water!" Tortoise said, "The water belongs to Elephant."

There came Lion, and said, "Little Tortoise, give me water!" When little 
Tortoise was about to say something, Lion got hold of him and beat him; Lion 
drank of the water, and since then the animals drink water.

When Elephant came back from the hunting, he said, "Little Tortoise, is 
there water?" Tortoise answered, "The animals have drunk the water." 
Elephant asked, "Little Tortoise, shall I chew you or swallow you down?" 
Little Tortoise said, "Swallow me, if you please!" and Elephant swallowed 
him whole.

After Elephant had swallowed Little Tortoise, and he had entered his body, 
he tore off his liver, heart, and kidneys. Elephant said, "Little Tortoise, 
you kill me."

So Elephant died; but little Tortoise came out of his dead body, and went 
wherever he liked.

ANOTHER VERSION OF THE SAME FABLE
GRAFFE and Tortoise, they say, met one day. Giraffe said to Tortoise, "At 
once I could trample you to death." Tortoise, being afraid, remained silent. 
Then Giraffe said, "At once I could swallow you." Tortoise said, in answer 
to this, " Well, I just belong to the family of those whom it has always 
been customary to swallow." Then Giraffe swallowed Tortoise; but when the 
latter was being gulped down, he stuck in Giraffe's throat, and as the 
latter could not get it down, he was choked to death.

When Giraffe was dead, Tortoise crawled out and went to Crab (who is 
considered as the mother of Tortoise), and told her what had happened. Then 
Crab said:

 

"The little Crab! I could sprinkle it under its arm with Boochoo,[1]
The crooked-legged little one, I could sprinkle under its arm."

Tortoise answered its mother and said:

Have you not always sprinkled me,
That you want to sprinkle me now?

Then they went and fed for a whole year on the remains of Giraffe.

[1 (In token of approval, according to a Hottentot custom.)]

TORTOISES HUNTING OSTRICHES
ONE day, it is said, the Tortoises held a council how they might hunt 
Ostriches, and they said, "Let us, on both sides, stand in rows near each 
other, and let one go to hunt the Ostriches, so that they must flee along 
through the midst of us." They did so, and as they were many, the Ostriches 
were obliged to run along through the midst of them. During this they did 
not move, but, remaining always in the same places, called each to the 
other, "Are you there?" and each one answered, "I am here." The Ostriches 
hearing this, ran so tremendously that they quite exhausted their strength, 
and fell down. Then the Tortoises assembled by-and-by at the place where the 
Ostriches had fallen, and devoured them.

THE JUDGMENT OF BABOON
ONE day, it is said, the following story happened:

Mouse had torn the clothes of Itkler (the tailor), who then went to Baboon, 
and accused Mouse with these words:

"In this manner I come to thee: Mouse has torn my clothes, but will not know 
anything of it, and accuses Cat; Cat protests likewise her innocence, and 
says, 'Dog must have done it; but Dog denies it also, and declares Wood has 
done it; and Wood throws the blame on Fire, and says, 'Fire did it'; Fire 
says, ' have not, Water did it'; Water says, 'Elephant tore the clothes'; 
and Elephant says, 'Ant tore them.' Thus a dispute has arisen among them. 
Therefore, 1, Itkler, come to thee with this proposition: Assemble the 
people and try them in order that I may get satisfaction."

Thus he spake, and Baboon assembled them for trial. Then they made the same 
excuses which had been mentioned by Itkler, each one putting the blame upon 
the other.

So Baboon did not see any other way of punishing them, save through making 
them punish each other; he therefore said,

"Mouse, give Itkler satisfaction."

Mouse, however, pleaded not guilty. But Baboon said, "Cat, bite Mouse." She 
did so.

He then put the same question to Cat, and when she exculpated herself, 
Baboon called to Dog, "Here, bite Cat."

In this manner Baboon questioned them all, one after the other, but they 
each denied the charge. Then he addressed the following words to them, and 
said,

Wood, beat Dog.
Fire, burn Wood.
Water, quench Fire.
Elephant, drink Water.

Ant, bite Elephant in his most tender parts."

They did so, and since that day they cannot any longer agree with each 
other.

Ant enters into Elephant's most tender parts and bites him.

Elephant swallows Water.
Water quenches Fire.
Fire consumes Wood.
Wood beats Dog.
Dog bites Cat.
And Cat bites Mouse.

Through this judgment Itkler got satisfaction, and addressed Baboon in the 
following manner:

"Yes! Now I am content, since I have received satisfaction, and with all my 
heart I thank thee, Baboon, because thou hast exercised justice on my behalf 
and given me redress."

Then Baboon said, "From to-day I will not any longer be called Jan, but 
Baboon shall be my name."

Since that time Baboon walks on all fours, having probably lost the 
privilege of walking erect through this foolish judgment.

LION AND BABOON
BABOON, it is said, once worked bamboos, sitting on the edge of a precipice, 
and Lion stole upon him. Baboon, however, had fixed some round, glistening, 
eyelike plates on the back of his head. When, therefore, Lion crept upon 
him, he thought, when Baboon was looking at him, that he sat with his back 
towards him, and crept with all his might upon him. When, however, Baboon 
turned his back towards him, Lion thought that he was seen, and bid himself. 
Thus, when Baboon looked at him, he crept upon him.[1] When he was near him 
Baboon looked up, and Lion continued to creep upon him. Baboon said (aside), 
"Whilst I am looking at him he steals upon me, whilst my hollow eyes are on 
him."

When at last Lion sprung at him, he lay (quickly) down upon his face, and 
Lion jumped over him, falling down the precipice, and was dashed to pieces.

[1. Whilst Baboon did this, Lion came close upon him.]

THE ZEBRA STALLION
THE Baboons, it is said, used to disturb the Zebra Mares in drinking. But 
one of the Mares became the mother of a foal. The others then helped her to 
suckle (the young stallion), that he might soon grow up.

When he was grown up and they were in want of water, he brought them to the 
water. The Baboons, seeing this, came, as they formerly were used to do, 
into their way, and kept them from the water.

While the Mares stood thus, the Stallion stepped forward, and spoke to one 
of the Baboons, "Thou gum-eater's child!"

The Baboon said to the Stallion, "Please open tby mouth, that I may see what 
thou livest on." The Stallion opened his mouth, and it was milky.

Then the Stallion said to the Baboon, "Please open thy mouth also, tbat I 
may see," The Baboon did so, and there was some gum in it. But the Baboon 
quickly licked some milk off the Stallion's tongue. The Stallion on this 
became angry, took the Baboon by his shoulders, and pressed him upon a hot, 
flat rock. Since that day the Baboon has a bald place on his back.

The Baboon said, lamenting, "I, my mother's child, I, the gum-eater, am 
outdone by this milkeater!

WHEN LION COULD FLY
LION, it is said, used once to fly, and at that time nothing could live 
before him. As he was unwilling that the bones of what he caught should be 
broken into pieces, he made a pair of White Crows watch the bones, leaving 
them behind at the kraal whilst he went a-hunting. But one day Great Frog 
came there, broke the bones in pieces, and said, "Why can men and animals 
live no longer?" And he added these words, "When he comes, tell him that I 
live at yonder pool; if he wishes to see me, he must come there."

Lion, lying in wait (for game), wanted to fly up, but found he could not 
fly. Then he got angry, thinking that at the kraal something was wrong, and 
returned home. When he arrived, he asked, "What have you done that I cannot 
fly?" Then they answered and said, "Some one came here, broke the bones into 
pieces, and said, 'If he want me, he may look for me at yonder pool!"' Lion 
went, and arrived while Frog was sitting at the water's edge, and he tried 
to creep stealthily upon him. When he was about to get hold of him, Frog 
said, "Ho!" and, diving, went to the other side of the pool, and sat there. 
Lion pursued him; but as he could not catch him he returned home.

From that day, it is said, Lion walked on his feet, and also began to creep 
upon (bis game); and the White Crows became entirely dumb since the day that 
they said, "Nothing can be said of that matter."

LION WHO THOUGHT HIM SELF WISER THAN HIS MOTHER
IT is said that when Lion and Gurikhoisip (the Only man), together with 
Baboon, Buffalo, and other friends, were playing one day at a certain game, 
there was a thunderstorm and rain at Aroxaams. Lion and Gurikhoisip began to 
quarrel. "I shall run to the rain-field," said Lion. Gurikhoisip said also, 
"I shall run to the rain-field." As neither would concede this to the other, 
they separated (angrily). After they had parted, Lion went to tell his 
mother those things which they had both said.

His Mother said to him, "My son! that Man whose head is in a line with his 
shoulders and breast, who has pinching weapons, who keeps white dogs, who 
goes about wearing the tuft of a tiger tail, beware of him!" Lion, however, 
said, "Why need I be on my guard against those whom I know?" Lioness 
answered, "My Son, take care of him who has pinching weapons!" But Lion 
would not follow his Mother's advice, and the same morning, when it was 
still pitch dark, he went to Aroxaams, and laid himself in ambush. 
Gurikhoisip went also that morning to the same place. When he had arrived he 
let his dogs drink, and then bathe. After they had finished they wallowed. 
Then also Man drank; and, when he had done drinking, Lion came out of the 
bush. Dogs surrounded him as his Mother had foretold, and he was speared by 
Gurikhoisip. Just as lie became aware that he was speared, the Dogs drew him 
down again. In this manner he grew faint. While he was in this state, 
Gurikhoisip said to the Dogs, "Let him alone now, that he may go and be 
taught by his Mother." So the Dogs let him go. They left him, and went home 
as he lay there. The same night he walked towards home, but whilst he was on 
the way his strength failed him, and he lamented:

"Mother! take me up!
Grandmother! take me up! Oh me! Alas!"

At the dawn of day his Mother heard his wailing, and said-

"My Son, this is the thing which I have told thee:

"Beware of the one who has pinching weapons,
Who wears a tuft of tiger's tail,
Of him who has white dogs!
Alas! thou son of her who is short-eared,
Thou, my short-eared child!
Son of her who eats raw flesh,
Thou flesh-devourer;
Son of her whose nostrils are red from the prey,
Thou with blood-stained nostrils!
Son of her who drinks pit-water,
Thou water-drinker!'"

LION WHO TOOK A WOMAN'S SHAPE
SOME Women, it is said, went out to seek roots and herbs and other wild 
food. On their way home they sat down and said, Let us taste the food of the 
field." Now they found that the food picked by one of them was sweet, while 
that of the others was bitter. The latter said to each other, "Look here! 
this Woman's herbs are sweet." Then they said to the owner of the sweet 
food, "Throw it away and seek for other." So she threw away the food, and 
went to gather more. When she had collected a sufficient supply, she 
returned to join the other Women, but could not flnd them. She went 
therefore down to the river, where Hare sat lading water, and said to him, 
"Hare, give me some water that I may drink." But he replied, "This is the 
cup out of which my uncle (Lion) and I alone may drink."

She asked again: "Hare, draw water for me that I may drink." But Hare made 
the same reply. Then she snatched the cup from him and drank, but he ran 
home to tell his uncle of the outrage which had been committed.

The Woman meanwhile replaced the cup and went away. After she had departed 
Lion came down, and, seeing her in the distance, pursued her on the road. 
When she turned round and saw him coming, she sang in the following manner:

"My mother, she would not let me seek herbs,
Herbs of the field, food from the field. Hoo!"

When Lion at last came up with the Woman, they hunted each other round a 
shrub. She wore many beads and arm-rings, and Lion said, "Let me put them 
on!" So she lent them to him, but he afterwards refused to return them to 
her.

They then hunted each other again round the shrub, till Lion fell (town, and 
the Woman jumped upon him, and kept him there. Lion (uttering a form of 
conjuration) said:

"My Aunt! it is morning, and time to rise;
Pray, rise from me!"

She then rose from him, and they hunted again after each other round the 
shrub, till the Woman fell down, and Lion jumped upon her. She then 
addressed him:

"My Uncle! it is morning, and time to rise;
Pray, rise from me!"

He rose, of course, and they hunted each other again, till Lion fell a 
second time. When she jumped upon him he said:

My Aunt! it is morning, and time to rise;
Pray, rise from me!"

They rose again and hunted after each other. The Woman at last fell down. 
But this time when she repeated the above conjuration, Lion said:

"Hè Kha! Is it morning, and time to rise?"

He then ate her, taking care, however, to leave her skin whole, which he put 
on, together with her dress and ornaments, so that he looked quite like a 
woman, and then went home to her kraal.

When this counterfeit woman arrived, her little sister, crying, said, "My 
sister, pour some milk out for me." She answered, "I shall not pour you out 
any." Then the Child addressed their Mother: "Mama, do pour out some for 
me." The Mother of the kraal said, "Go to your sister, and let her give it 
to you!" The little Child said again to her sister, "Please, pour out for 
me!" She, however, repeated her refusal, saying, "I will not do it." Then 
the Mother of the kraal said to the little One, "I refused to let her (the 
elder sister) seek herbs in the field, and I do not know what mav have 
happened; go therefore to Hare, and ask him to pour out for you."

So then Hare gave her some milk; but her elder sister said, "Come and share 
it with me." The little Child then went to her sister with her bamboo (cup), 
and they both sucked the milk out of it. Whilst they were doing this, some 
milk was spilt on the little one's hand, and the elder sister licked it up 
with her tongue, the roughness of which drew blood; this, too, the Woman 
licked up.

The little child complained to her Mother:

"Mama, sister pricks holes in me and sucks the blood. The Mother said, "With 
what Lion's nature your sister went the way that I forbade her, and 
returned, I do not know."

Now the Cows arried, and the elder sister cleansed the pails in order to 
milk them. But when she approached the Cows witha thong (in order to tie 
their fore-legs), they all refused to be milked by her.

Hare said,"Whey do not you sand before the Cow?" She replied, "Hare, call 
your brother, and do you two stand before the Cow." Her husband said, "What 
has come over her that the Cows refuse her? These are the same Cows she 
always milks." The Mother (of the kraal) said, "What has happened this 
evening? These are Cows that she always milks without assistance. What can 
have affected her that she comes home a woman with a Lion's nature."

The elder daughter then said to her Mother, I shall not milk the Cows." With 
these words she sat down. The Mother said therefore to Hare, "Bring me the 
bamboos, that I may milk. I do not know what has come over the girl."

So the Mother herself milked the cows, and when she had done so, Hare 
brought the bamboos to the young wife's house, where her husband was, but 
she (the wife) did not give him (her husband) anything to eat. But when at 
night time she fell asleep, they saw some of the Lion's hair, which was 
hanging out where he had slipped on the Woman's skin, and they cried, 
"Verily! this is quite another being. It is for this reason that the Cows 
refused to be milked."

Then the people of the kraal began to break up the hut in which Lion lay 
asleep. When they took off the mats, they said (conjuring them), "If thou 
art favourably inclined to me, O Mat, give the sound 'sawa'" (meaning, 
making no noise).

To the poles (on which the but rested) they said, " If thou art favourably 
inclined to me, O Pole, thou must give the sound 'gara.'

They addressed also the bamboos and the bedskins in a similar manner.

Thus gradually and noiselessly they removed the hut and all its contents. 
Then they took bunches of grass, put them over the Lion, and lighting them, 
said, "If thou art favourably inclined to me, O Fire, thou must flare up, 
'boo boo,' before thou comest to the heart."

So the Fire flared up when it came towards the heart, and the heart of the 
Woman jumped upon the ground. The Mother (of the kraal) picked it up, and 
put it into a calabash.

Lion, from his place in the fire, said to the Mother (of the kraal), "How 
nicely I have eaten your daugher." The Woman answered, "You have also now a 
comfortable place!"

Now the Woman took the first milk of as many Cows had calves, and put it 
into the calabash where her daughter's heart was; the calabash increased in 
size, and in proportion to this the girl grew again inside it.

One day, when the Mother (of the kraal) went out to fetch wood, she said to 
Hare, "By the time that I come back you must have everything nice and 
clean." But during her Mother's absence, the girl crept out of the calabash, 
and put the hut in good order, as she had been used to do in former days, 
and said to Hare, "When Mother comes back and asks, 'Who has done these 
things?' you must say, 'I, Hare, did them.' "After she had done all, she hid 
herself on the stage.

When the Mother of the kraal caine home, she said, "Hare, who has done these 
things? They look just as they used when my daughter did them." Hare said, 
"I did the things." But the Mother would not believe it, and looked at the 
calabash. Seeing it was empty, she searched the stage and found her 
daughter. Then she embraced and kissed her, and from that day the girl 
stayed with her Mother, and did every thing as she was wont in former times; 
but she now remained unmarried.

WHY HAS JACKAL A LONG, BLACK STRIPE ON HIS BACK?
THE Sun, it is said, was one day on earth, and the men who were travelling 
saw him sitting by the wayside, but passed him without notice. Jackal, 
however, who came after them, and also sitting, went to him and said, "Such 
a fine little child is left behind by the men." He then took Sun up, and put 
it into this awa-skin (on his back). When it burnt him, he said, "Get down," 
and shook himself; but Sun stuck fast to his back, and burnt Jackal's back 
black from that day.

HORSE CURSED BY SUN
IT is said that once Sun was on earth, and caught Horse to ride it. But it 
was unable to bear his weight, and therefore Ox took the place of Horse, aud 
carried Sun on its back. Since that time Horse is cursed in these words, 
because it could not carry Sun's weight:

From to-day thou shalt have a (certain) time of dying.
This is thy curse, that thou hast a (certain) time of dying.
And day and night shalt thou eat,
But the desire of thy heart shall not be at rest,
Though thou grazest till morning and again until sunset.
Behold, this is the judgment which I pass upon thee," said Sun.

Since that day Horse's (certain) time of dying commenced.

LION'S DEFEAT
The wild animals, it is said, were once asembled at Lion's. When Lion was 
asleep, Jackal persuaded Little Fox to twist a rope of ostrich sinews, in 
order to play Lion a trick. They took ostrich sinews, twisted them, and 
fastened the rope to Lion's tail, and the other end of the rope they tied to 
a shrub. When Lion awoke, and saw that he was tied up, he became angry, and 
called the animals together. When they had assembled, Lion said (using this 
form of conjuration)-

"What child of his mother and father's love,
Whose mother and father's love has tied me? "

Then answered the animatl to whom the question was first put-

I, child of my mother and father's love,
I, mother and father's love, I have not done it.

All answered the same; but when he asked Little Fox, Little Fox said-

I, child of my mother and father's love,
I, mother and father's love, have tied thee!

Then Lion tore the rope made of sinews, and ran after Little Fox. But Jackal 
said:

"My boy, thou son of lean Mrs. Fox, thou wilt never be caught."

Truly Lion was thus beaten in running by Little Fox.

THE ORIGIN OF DEATH
THE Moon, it is said, sent once an Insect to Men, saying, "Go thou to Men, 
and tell them, 'As I die, and dying live, so ye shall also die, and dying 
live.'" The Insect started with the message, but whilst on his way was 
overtaken by the Hare, who asked: "On what errand art thou bound? "The 
Insect answered: "I am sent by the Moon to Men, to tell them that as she 
dies, and dying lives, they also shall die, and dying live." The Hare said, 
"As thou art an awkward runner, let me go" (to take the message). With these 
words he ran off, and when he reached Men, he said, "I am sent by the Moon 
to tell you, 'As I die, and dying perish, in the same manner ye shall also 
die and come wholly to an end."' Then the Hare returned to the Moon, and 
told her what he had said to Men. The Moon reproached him angrily, saying, 
"Darest thou tell the people a thing which I have not said? With these words 
she took up a piece of wood, and struck him on the nose. Since that day the 
Hare's nose is slit.

ANOTHER VERSION OF THE SAME FABLE
THE Moon dies,and rises to life again. Tlie Moon said to the Hare, " Go thou 
to Men, and tell them,'Like as I die and rise to life again, so you also 
shall die and rise to life again.'" The Hare went to the Men, and said, 
"Like as I die and do not rise to life again, so you shall also die, and not 
rise to life again." When he returned the Moon asked him, "What hast thou 
said?" "I have told them, 'Like as I die and do not rise to life again, so 
you shall also die and not rise to life again."' "What," said the Moon, " 
hast thou said that?" And she took a stick and beat the Hare on his mouth, 
which was slit by the blow. The Hare fled, and is still fleeing.

A THIRD VERSION OF THE SAME FABLE
THE Moon, on one occasion, sent the Hare to the earth to inform Men that as 
she (the Moon) died away and rose again, so mankind should die and rise 
again. Instead, however, of delivering this message as given, the Hare, 
either out of forgetfulness or malice, told mankind that as the Moon rose 
and died away, so Man should die and rise no more. The Hare, having returned 
to the Moon, was questioned as to the message delivered, and the Moon, 
having heard the true state of the case, became so enraged with him that she 
took up a hatchet to split his head; falling short, however, of that, the 
hatchet fell upon the upper lip of the Hare, and cut it severely. Hence it 
is that we see the "Hare-lip." The Hare, being duly incensed at having 
received such treatment, raised his claws, and scratched the Moon's face and 
the dark spots which we now see on the surface of the Moon are the scars 
which she received on that occasion.

A FOURTH VERSION OF THE SAME FABLE
THE Moon, they say, wished to send a message to Men, and the Hare said that 
he would take it. "Run, then," said the Moon, "and tell Men that as I die 
and am renewed, so shall they also be renewed." But the Hare deceived Men, 
and said, "As I die and perish, so shall you also."

A ZULU VERSION OF THE LEGEND OF THE "ORIGIN OF DEATH"
GOD (Unknlunkulu) arose from beneath (the seat of the spiritual world, 
according to the Zulu idea), and created in the beginning men, animals, and 
all things. He then sent for the Chameleon, and said, "Go, Chameleon, and 
tell Men that they shall not die." The Chameleon went, but it walked slowly, 
and loitered on the way, eating of a shrub called Bukwebezane.

When it had been away some time, God sent the Salamander after it, ordering 
him to make haste and tell Men that they should die. The Salamander went on 
his way with this message, outran the Chameleon, and, arriving first where 
the Men were, told them that they must die.
