BOYHOOD

By LEO TOLSTOY

Translated by CJ HOGARTH




I

A SLOW JOURNEY

Again two carriages stood at the front door of the house at
Petrovskoe. In one of them sat Mimi, the two girls, and their
maid, with the bailiff, Jakoff, on the box, while in the other--a
britchka--sat Woloda, myself, and our servant Vassili. Papa, who
was to follow us to Moscow in a few days, was standing bareheaded
on the entrance-steps. He made the sign of the cross at the
windows of the carriages, and said:

"Christ go with you! Good-bye."

Jakoff and our coachman (for we had our own horses) lifted their
caps in answer, and also made the sign of the cross.

"Amen. God go with us!"

The carriages began to roll away, and the birch-trees of the
great avenue filed out of sight.

I was not in the least depressed on this occasion, for my mind
was not so much turned upon what I had left as upon what was
awaiting me. In proportion as the various objects connected with
the sad recollections which had recently filled my imagination
receded behind me, those recollections lost their power, and gave
place to a consolatory feeling of life, youthful vigour,
freshness, and hope.

Seldom have I spent four days more--well, I will not say gaily,
since I should still have shrunk from appearing gay--but more
agreeably and pleasantly than those occupied by our journey.

No longer were my eyes confronted with the closed door of Mamma's
room (which I had never been able to pass without a pang), nor
with the covered piano (which nobody opened now, and at which I
could never look without trembling), nor with mourning dresses
(we had each of us on our ordinary travelling clothes), nor with
all those other objects which recalled to me so vividly our
irreparable loss, and forced me to abstain from any manifestation
of merriment lest I should unwittingly offend against HER memory.

On the contrary, a continual succession of new and exciting
objects and places now caught and held my attention, and the
charms of spring awakened in my soul a soothing sense of
satisfaction with the present and of blissful hope for the
future.

Very early next morning the merciless Vassili (who had only just
entered our service, and was therefore, like most people in such
a position, zealous to a fault) came and stripped off my
counterpane, affirming that it was time for me to get up, since
everything was in readiness for us to continue our journey.
Though I felt inclined to stretch myself and rebel--though I
would
gladly have spent another quarter of an hour in sweet enjoyment
of my morning slumber--Vassili's inexorable face showed that he
would grant me no respite, but that he was ready to tear away the
counterpane twenty times more if necessary. Accordingly I
submitted myself to the inevitable and ran down into the
courtyard to wash myself at the fountain.

In the coffee-room, a tea-kettle was already surmounting the fire
which Milka the ostler, as red in the face as a crab, was blowing
with a pair of bellows. All was grey and misty in the courtyard,
like steam from a smoking dunghill, but in the eastern sky the
sun was diffusing a clear, cheerful radiance, and making the
straw roofs of the sheds around the courtyard sparkle with the
night dew. Beneath them stood our horses, tied to mangers, and I
could hear the ceaseless sound of their chewing. A curly-haired
dog which had been spending the night on a dry dunghill now rose
in lazy fashion and, wagging its tail, walked slowly across the
courtyard.

The bustling landlady opened the creaking gates, turned her
meditative cows into the street (whence came the lowing and
bellowing of other cattle), and exchanged a word or two with a
sleepy neighbour. Philip, with his shirt-sleeves rolled up, was
working the windlass of a draw-well, and sending sparkling fresh
water coursing into an oaken trough, while in the pool beneath it
some early-rising ducks were taking a bath. It gave me pleasure
to watch his strongly-marked, bearded face, and the veins and
muscles as they stood out upon his great powerful hands whenever
he made an extra effort. In the room behind the partition-wall
where Mimi and the girls had slept (yet so near to ourselves that
we had exchanged confidences overnight) movements now became
audible, their maid kept passing in and out with clothes, and, at
last the door opened and we were summoned to breakfast. Woloda,
however, remained in a state of bustle throughout as he ran to
fetch first one article and then another and urged the maid to
hasten her preparations.

The horses were put to, and showed their impatience by tinkling
their bells. Parcels, trunks, dressing-cases, and boxes were
replaced, and we set about taking our seats. Yet, every time that
we got in, the mountain of luggage in the britchka seemed to have
grown larger than before, and we had much ado to understand how
things had been arranged yesterday, and how we should sit now. A
tea-chest, in particular, greatly inconvenienced me, but Vassili
declared that "things will soon right themselves," and I had no
choice but to believe him.

The sun was just rising, covered with dense white clouds, and
every object around us was standing out in a cheerful, calm sort
of radiance. The whole was beautiful to look at, and I felt
comfortable and light of heart.

Before us the road ran like a broad, sinuous ribbon through
cornfields glittering with dew. Here and there a dark bush or
young birch-tree cast a long shadow over the ruts and scattered
grass-tufts of the track. Yet even the monotonous din of our
carriage-wheels and collar-bells could not drown the joyous song
of soaring larks, nor the combined odour of moth-eaten cloth,
dust, and sourness peculiar to our britchka overpower the fresh
scents of the morning. I felt in my heart that delightful impulse
to be up and doing which is a sign of sincere enjoyment.

As I had not been able to say my prayers in the courtyard of the
inn, but had nevertheless been assured once that on the very
first day when I omitted to perform that ceremony some misfortune
would overtake me, I now hastened to rectify the omission. Taking
off my cap, and stooping down in a corner of the britchka, I duly
recited my orisons, and unobtrusively signed the sign of the
cross beneath my coat. Yet all the while a thousand different
objects were distracting my attention, and more than once I
inadvertently repeated a prayer twice over.

Soon on the little footpath beside the road became visible some
slowly moving figures. They were pilgrims. On their heads they
had dirty handkerchiefs, on their backs wallets of birch-bark,
and on their feet bundles of soiled rags and heavy bast shoes.
Moving their staffs in regular rhythm, and scarcely throwing us a
glance, they pressed onwards with heavy tread and in single file.

"Where have they come from?" I wondered to myself, "and whither
are they bound? Is it a long pilgrimage they are making?" But
soon the shadows they cast on the road became indistinguishable
from the shadows of the bushes which they passed.

Next a carriage-and-four could be seen approaching us. In two
seconds the faces which looked out at us from it with smiling
curiosity had vanished. How strange it seemed that those faces
should have nothing in common with me, and that in all
probability they would never meet my eyes again!

Next came a pair of post-horses, with the traces looped up to
their collars. On one of them a young postillion-his lamb's wool
cap cocked to one side-was negligently kicking his booted legs
against the flanks of his steed as he sang a melancholy ditty.
Yet his face and attitude seemed to me to express such perfect
carelessness and indolent ease that I imagined it to be the
height of happiness to be a postillion and to sing melancholy
songs.

Far off, through a cutting in the road, there soon stood out
against the light-blue sky, the green roof of a village church.
Presently the village itself became visible, together with the
roof of the manor-house and the garden attached to it. Who lived
in that house? Children, parents, teachers? Why should we not
call there and make the acquaintance of its inmates?

Next we overtook a file of loaded waggons--a procession to which
our vehicles had to yield the road.

"What have you got in there?" asked Vassili of one waggoner who
was dangling his legs lazily over the splashboard of his
conveyance and flicking his whip about as he gazed at us with a
stolid, vacant look; but he only made answer when we were too far
off to catch what he said.

"And what have YOU got?" asked Vassili of a second waggoner who
was lying at full length under a new rug on the driving-seat of
his vehicle. The red poll and red face beneath it lifted
themselves up for a second from the folds of the rug, measured
our britchka with a cold, contemptuous look, and lay down again;
whereupon I concluded that the driver was wondering to himself
who we were, whence we had come, and whither we were going.

These various objects of interest had absorbed so much of my time
that, as yet, I had paid no attention to the crooked figures on
the verst posts as we passed them in rapid succession; but in
time the sun began to burn my head and back, the road to become
increasingly dusty, the impedimenta in the carriage to grow more
and more uncomfortable, and myself to feel more and more cramped.
Consequently, I relapsed into devoting my whole faculties to the
distance-posts and their numerals, and to solving difficult
mathematical problems for reckoning the time when we should
arrive at the next posting-house.

"Twelve versts are a third of thirty-six, and in all there are
forty-one to Lipetz. We have done a third and how much, then?",
and so forth, and so forth.

"Vassili," was my next remark, on observing that he was beginning
to nod on the box-seat, "suppose we change seats? Will you?"
Vassili agreed, and had no sooner stretched himself out in the
body of the vehicle than he began to snore. To me on my new
perch, however, a most interesting spectacle now became visible--
namely, our horses, all of which were familiar to me down to the
smallest detail.

"Why is Diashak on the right today, Philip, not on the left?" I
asked knowingly. "And Nerusinka is not doing her proper share of
the pulling."

"One could not put Diashak on the left," replied Philip,
altogether ignoring my last remark. "He is not the kind of horse
to put there at all. A horse like the one on the left now is the
right kind of one for the job."

After this fragment of eloquence, Philip turned towards Diashak
and began to do his best to worry the poor animal by jogging at
the reins, in spite of the fact that Diashak was doing well and
dragging the vehicle almost unaided. This Philip continued to do
until he found it convenient to breathe and rest himself awhile
and to settle his cap askew, though it had looked well enough
before.

I profited by the opportunity to ask him to let me have the reins
to hold, until, the whole six in my hand, as well as the whip, I
had attained complete happiness. Several times I asked whether I
was doing things right, but, as usual, Philip was never
satisfied, and soon destroyed my felicity.

The heat increased until a hand showed itself at the carriage
window, and waved a bottle and a parcel of eatables; whereupon
Vassili leapt briskly from the britchka, and ran forward to get
us something to eat and drink.

When we arrived at a steep descent, we all got out and ran down
it to a little bridge, while Vassili and Jakoff followed,
supporting the carriage on either side, as though to hold it up
in the event of its threatening to upset.

After that, Mimi gave permission for a change of seats, and
sometimes Woloda or myself would ride in the carriage, and
Lubotshka or Katenka in the britchka. This arrangement greatly
pleased the girls, since much more fun went on in the britchka.
Just when the day was at its hottest, we got out at a wood, and,
breaking off a quantity of branches, transformed our vehicle into
a bower. This travelling arbour then bustled on to catch the
carriage up, and had the effect of exciting Lubotshka to one of
those piercing shrieks of delight which she was in the habit of
occasionally emitting.

At last we drew near the village where we were to halt and dine.
Already we could perceive the smell of the place--the smell of
smoke and tar and sheep-and distinguish the sound of voices,
footsteps, and carts. The bells on our horses began to ring less
clearly than they had done in the open country, and on both sides
the road became lined with huts--dwellings with straw roofs,
carved porches, and small red or green painted shutters to the
windows, through which, here and there, was a woman's face
looking inquisitively out. Peasant children clad in smocks only
stood staring open-eyed or, stretching out their arms to us, ran
barefooted through the dust to climb on to the luggage behind,
despite Philip's menacing gestures. Likewise, red-haired waiters
came darting around the carriages to invite us, with words and
signs, to select their several hostelries as our halting-place.

Presently a gate creaked, and we entered a courtyard. Four hours
of rest and liberty now awaited us.



II. THE THUNDERSTORM

The sun was sinking towards the west, and his long, hot rays were
burning my neck and cheeks beyond endurance, while thick clouds
of dust were rising from the road and filling the whole air. Not
the slightest wind was there to carry it away. I could not think
what to do. Neither the dust-blackened face of Woloda dozing in a
corner, nor the motion of Philip's back, nor the long shadow of
our britchka as it came bowling along behind us brought me any
relief.  I concentrated my whole attention upon the distance-
posts ahead and the clouds which, hitherto dispersed over the
sky, were now assuming a menacing blackness, and beginning to
form themselves into a single solid mass.

From time to time distant thunder could be heard--a circumstance
which greatly increased my impatience to arrive at the inn where
we were to spend the night. A thunderstorm always communicated to
me an inexpressibly oppressive feeling of fear and gloom.

Yet we were still ten versts from the next village, and in the
meanwhile the large purple cloudbank--arisen from no one knows
where--was advancing steadily towards us. The sun, not yet
obscured, was picking out its fuscous shape with dazzling light,
and marking its front with grey stripes running right down to the
horizon. At intervals, vivid lightning could be seen in the
distance, followed by low rumbles which increased steadily in
volume until they merged into a prolonged roll which seemed to
embrace the entire heavens. At length, Vassili got up and covered
over the britchka, the coachman wrapped himself up in his cloak
and lifted his cap to make the sign of the cross at each
successive thunderclap, and the horses pricked up their ears and
snorted as though to drink in the fresh air which the flying
clouds were outdistancing. The britchka began to roll more
swiftly along the dusty road, and I felt uneasy, and as though
the blood were coursing more quickly through my veins. Soon the
clouds had veiled the face of the sun, and though he threw a last
gleam of light to the dark and terrifying horizon, he had no
choice but to disappear behind them.

Suddenly everything around us seemed changed, and assumed a
gloomy aspect. A wood of aspen trees which we were passing seemed
to be all in a tremble, with its leaves showing white against the
dark lilac background of the clouds, murmuring together in an
agitated manner. The tops of the larger trees began to bend to
and fro, and dried leaves and grass to whirl about in eddies over
the road. Swallows and white-breasted swifts came darting around
the britchka and even passing in front of the forelegs of the
horses. While rooks, despite their outstretched wings, were laid,
as it were, on their keels by the wind. Finally, the leather
apron which covered us began to flutter about and to beat against
the sides of the conveyance.

The lightning flashed right into the britchka as, cleaving the
obscurity for a second, it lit up the grey cloth and silk galloon
of the lining and Woloda's figure pressed back into a corner.

Next came a terrible sound which, rising higher and higher, and
spreading further and further, increased until it reached its
climax in a deafening thunderclap which made us tremble and hold
our breaths. "The wrath of God"--what poetry there is in that
simple popular conception!

The pace of the vehicle was continually increasing, and from
Philip's and Vassili's backs (the former was tugging furiously at
the reins) I could see that they too were alarmed.

Bowling rapidly down an incline, the britchka cannoned violently
against a wooden bridge at the bottom. I dared not stir and
expected destruction every moment.

Crack! A trace had given way, and, in spite of the ceaseless,
deafening thunderclaps, we had to pull up on the bridge.

Leaning my head despairingly against the side of the britchka, I
followed with a beating heart the movements of Philip's great
black fingers as he tied up the broken trace and, with hands and
the butt-end of the whip, pushed the harness vigorously back into
its place.

My sense of terror was increasing with the violence of the
thunder. Indeed, at the moment of supreme silence which generally
precedes the greatest intensity of a storm, it mounted to such a
height that I felt as though another quarter of an hour of this
emotion would kill me.

Just then there appeared from beneath the bridge a human being
who, clad in a torn, filthy smock, and supported on a pair of
thin shanks bare of muscles, thrust an idiotic face, a tremulous,
bare, shaven head, and a pair of red, shining stumps in place of
hands into the britchka.

"M-my lord! A copeck for--for God's sake!" groaned a feeble voice
as at each word the wretched being made the sign of the cross and
bowed himself to the ground.

I cannot describe the chill feeling of horror which penetrated my
heart at that moment. A shudder crept through all my hair, and my
eyes stared in vacant terror at the outcast.

Vassili, who was charged with the apportioning of alms during the
journey, was busy helping Philip, and only when everything had
been put straight and Philip had resumed the reins again had he
time to look for his purse. Hardly had the britchka begun to move
when a blinding flash filled the welkin with a blaze of light
which brought the horses to their haunches. Then, the flash was
followed by such an ear-splitting roar that the very vault of
heaven seemed to be descending upon our heads. The wind blew
harder than ever, and Vassili's cloak, the manes and tails of the
horses, and the carriage-apron were all slanted in one direction
as they waved furiously in the violent blast.

Presently, upon the britchka's top there fell some large drops of
rain--"one, two, three:" then suddenly, and as though a roll of
drums were being beaten over our heads, the whole countryside
resounded with the clatter of the deluge.

From Vassili's movements, I could see that he had now got his
purse open, and that the poor outcast was still bowing and making
the sign of the cross as he ran beside the wheels of the vehicle,
at the imminent risk of being run over, and reiterated from time
to time his plea, "For-for God's sake!" At last a copeck rolled
upon the ground, and the miserable creature--his mutilated arms,
with their sleeves wet through and through, held out before him--
stopped perplexed in the roadway and vanished from my sight.

The heavy rain, driven before the tempestuous wind, poured down
in pailfuls and, dripping from Vassili's thick cloak, formed a
series of pools on the apron. The dust became changed to a paste
which clung to the wheels, and the ruts became transformed into
muddy rivulets.

At last, however, the lightning grew paler and more diffuse, and
the thunderclaps lost some of their terror amid the monotonous
rattling of the downpour. Then the rain also abated, and the
clouds began to disperse. In the region of the sun, a lightness
appeared, and between the white-grey clouds could be caught
glimpses of an azure sky.

Finally, a dazzling ray shot across the pools on the road, shot
through the threads of rain--now falling thin and straight, as
from a sieve--, and fell upon the fresh leaves and blades of
grass. The great cloud was still louring black and threatening on
the far horizon, but I no longer felt afraid of it--I felt only
an inexpressibly pleasant hopefulness in proportion, as trust in
life replaced the late burden of fear. Indeed, my heart was
smiling like that of refreshed, revivified Nature herself.

Vassili took off his cloak and wrung the water from it. Woloda
flung back the apron, and I stood up in the britchka to drink in
the new, fresh, balm-laden air. In front of us was the carriage,
rolling along and looking as wet and resplendent in the sunlight
as though it had just been polished. On one side of the road
boundless oatfields, intersected in places by small ravines which
now showed bright with their moist earth and greenery, stretched
to the far horizon like a checkered carpet, while on the other
side of us an aspen wood, intermingled with hazel bushes, and
parquetted with wild thyme in joyous profusion, no longer rustled
and trembled, but slowly dropped rich, sparkling diamonds from
its newly-bathed branches on to the withered leaves of last year.

From above us, from every side, came the happy songs of little
birds calling to one another among the dripping brushwood, while
clear from the inmost depths of the wood sounded the voice of the
cuckoo. So delicious was the wondrous scent of the wood, the
scent
which follows a thunderstorm in spring, the scent of birch-trees,
violets, mushrooms, and thyme, that I could no longer remain in
the britchka. Jumping out, I ran to some bushes, and, regardless
of the showers of drops discharged upon me, tore off a few sprigs
of thyme, and buried my face in them to smell their glorious
scent.

Then, despite the mud which had got into my boots, as also the
fact that my stockings were soaked, I went skipping through the
puddles to the window of the carriage.

"Lubotshka! Katenka!" I shouted as I handed them some of the
thyme, "Just look how delicious this is!"

The girls smelt it and cried, "A-ah!" but Mimi shrieked to me to
go away, for fear I should be run over by the wheels.

"Oh, but smell how delicious it is!" I persisted.



III. A NEW POINT OF VIEW

Katenka was with me in the britchka; her lovely head inclined as
she gazed pensively at the roadway. I looked at her in silence
and wondered what had brought the unchildlike expression of
sadness to her face which I now observed for the first time
there.

"We shall soon be in Moscow," I said at last. "How large do you
suppose it is?"

"I don't know," she replied.

"Well, but how large do you IMAGINE? As large as Serpukhov?"

"What do you say?"

"Nothing."

Yet the instinctive feeling which enables one person to guess the
thoughts of another and serves as a guiding thread in
conversation soon made Katenka feel that her indifference was
disagreeable to me; wherefore she raised her head presently, and,
turning round, said:

"Did your Papa tell you that we girls too were going to live at
your Grandmamma's?"

"Yes, he said that we should ALL live there,"

"ALL live there?"

"Yes, of course. We shall have one half of the upper floor, and
you the other half, and Papa the wing; but we shall all of us
dine together with Grandmamma downstairs."

"But Mamma says that your Grandmamma is so very grave and so
easily made angry?"

"No, she only SEEMS like that at first. She is grave, but not
bad-tempered. On the contrary, she is both kind and cheerful. If
you could only have seen the ball at her house!"

"All the same, I am afraid of her. Besides, who knows whether
we--"

Katenka stopped short, and once again became thoughtful.

"What?" I asked with some anxiety.

"Nothing, I only said that--"

"No. You said, 'Who knows whether we--'"

"And YOU said, didn't you, that once there was ever such a ball
at Grandmamma's?"

"Yes. It is a pity you were not there. There were heaps of
guests--about a thousand people, and all of them princes or
generals, and there was music, and I danced-- But, Katenka" I
broke off, "you are not listening to me?"

"Oh yes, I am listening. You said that you danced--?"

"Why are you so serious?"

"Well, one cannot ALWAYS be gay."

"But you have changed tremendously since Woloda and I first went
to Moscow. Tell me the truth, now: why are you so odd?" My tone
was resolute.

"AM I so odd?" said Katenka with an animation which showed me
that my question had interested her. "I don't see that I am so at
all."

"Well, you are not the same as you were before," I continued.
"Once upon a time any one could see that you were our equal in
everything, and that you loved us like relations, just as we did
you; but now you are always serious, and keep yourself apart from
us."

"Oh, not at all."

"But let me finish, please," I interrupted, already conscious of
a slight tickling in my nose--the precursor of the tears which
usually came to my eyes whenever I had to vent any long pent-up
feeling. "You avoid us, and talk to no one but Mimi, as though
you had no wish for our further acquaintance."

"But one cannot always remain the same--one must change a little
sometimes," replied Katenka, who had an inveterate habit of
pleading some such fatalistic necessity whenever she did not know
what else to say.

I recollect that once, when having a quarrel with Lubotshka, who
had called her "a stupid girl," she (Katenka) retorted that
EVERYBODY could not be wise, seeing that a certain number of
stupid people was a necessity in the world. However, on the
present occasion, I was not satisfied that any such inevitable
necessity for "changing sometimes" existed, and asked further:

"WHY is it necessary?"

"Well, you see, we MAY not always go on living together as we are
doing now," said Katenka, colouring slightly, and regarding
Philip's back with a grave expression on her face. "My Mamma was
able to live with your mother because she was her friend; but
will a similar arrangement always suit the Countess, who, they
say, is so easily offended? Besides, in any case, we shall have
to separate SOME day. You are rich--you have Petrovskoe, while we
are poor--Mamma has nothing."

"You are rich," "we are poor"--both the words and the ideas which
they connoted seemed to me extremely strange. Hitherto, I had
conceived that only beggars and peasants were poor and could not
reconcile in my mind the idea of poverty and the graceful,
charming Katenka. I felt that Mimi and her daughter ought to live
with us ALWAYS and to share everything that we possessed. Things
ought never to be otherwise. Yet, at this moment, a thousand new
thoughts with regard to their lonely position came crowding into
my head, and I felt so remorseful at the notion that we were rich
and they poor, that I coloured up and could not look Katenka in
the face.

"Yet what does it matter," I thought, "that we are well off and
they are not? Why should that necessitate a separation? Why
should we not share in common what we possess?" Yet, I had a
feeling that I could not talk to Katenka on the subject, since a
certain practical instinct, opposed to all logical reasoning,
warned me that, right though she possibly was, I should do wrong
to tell her so.

"It is impossible that you should leave us. How could we ever
live apart?"

"Yet what else is there to be done? Certainly I do not WANT to do
it; yet, if it HAS to be done, I know what my plan in life will
be."

"Yes, to become an actress! How absurd!" I exclaimed (for I knew
that to enter that profession had always been her favourite
dream).

"Oh no. I only used to say that when I was a little girl."

"Well, then? What?"

"To go into a convent and live there. Then I could walk out in a
black dress and velvet cap!" cried Katenka.

Has it ever befallen you, my readers, to become suddenly aware
that your conception of things has altered--as though every
object in life had unexpectedly turned a side towards you of
which you had hitherto remained unaware? Such a species of moral
change occurred, as regards myself, during this journey, and
therefore from it I date the beginning of my boyhood. For the
first time in my life, I then envisaged the idea that we--i.e.
our family--were not the only persons in the world; that not
every conceivable interest was centred in ourselves; and that
there existed numbers of people who had nothing in common with
us, cared nothing for us, and even knew nothing of our existence.
No doubt I had known all this before--only I had not known it
then as I knew it now; I had never properly felt or understood
it.

Thought merges into conviction through paths of its own, as well
as, sometimes, with great suddenness and by methods wholly
different from those which have brought other intellects to the
same conclusion. For me the conversation with Katenka--striking
deeply as it did, and forcing me to reflect on her future
position--constituted such a path. As I gazed at the towns and
villages through which we passed, and in each house of which
lived at least one family like our own, as well as at the women
and children who stared with curiosity at our carriages and then
became lost to sight for ever, and the peasants and workmen who
did not even look at us, much less make us any obeisance, the
question arose for the first time in my thoughts, "Whom else do
they care for if not for us?" And this question was followed by
others, such as, "To what end do they live?" "How do they educate
their children?" "Do they teach their children and let them play?
What are their names?" and so forth.



IV. IN MOSCOW

From the time of our arrival in Moscow, the change in my
conception of objects, of persons, and of my connection with them
became increasingly perceptible. When at my first meeting with
Grandmamma, I saw her thin, wrinkled face and faded eyes, the
mingled respect and fear with which she had hitherto inspired me
gave place to compassion, and when, laying her cheek against
Lubotshka's head, she sobbed as though she saw before her the
corpse of her beloved daughter, my compassion grew to love.

I felt deeply sorry to see her grief at our meeting, even though
I knew that in ourselves we represented nothing in her eyes, but
were dear to her only as reminders of our mother--that every kiss
which she imprinted upon my cheeks expressed the one thought,
"She is no more--she is dead, and I shall never see her again."

Papa, who took little notice of us here in Moscow, and whose face
was perpetually preoccupied on the rare occasions when he came in
his black dress-coat to take formal dinner with us, lost much in
my eyes at this period, in spite of his turned-up ruffles, robes
de chambre, overseers, bailiffs, expeditions to the estate, and
hunting exploits.

Karl Ivanitch--whom Grandmamma always called "Uncle," and who
(Heaven knows why!) had taken it into his head to adorn the bald
pate of my childhood's days with a red wig parted in the middle--
now looked to me so strange and ridiculous that I wondered how I
could ever have failed to observe the fact before. Even between
the girls and ourselves there seemed to have sprung up an
invisible barrier. They, too, began to have secrets among
themselves, as well as to evince a desire to show off their ever-
lengthening skirts even as we boys did our trousers and ankle-
straps. As for Mimi, she appeared at luncheon, the first Sunday,
in such a gorgeous dress and with so many ribbons in her cap that
it was clear that we were no longer en campagne, and that
everything was now going to be different.



V. MY ELDER BROTHER

I was only a year and some odd months younger than Woloda, and
from the first we had grown up and studied and played together.
Hitherto, the difference between elder and younger brother had
never been felt between us, but at the period of which I am
speaking, I began to have a notion that I was not Woloda's equal
either in years, in tastes, or in capabilities. I even began to
fancy that Woloda himself was aware of his superiority and that
he was proud of it, and, though, perhaps, I was wrong, the idea
wounded my conceit--already suffering from frequent comparison
with him. He was my superior in everything--in games, in studies,
in quarrels, and in deportment. All this brought about an
estrangement between us and occasioned me moral sufferings which
I had never hitherto experienced.

When for the first time Woloda wore Dutch pleated shirts, I at
once said that I was greatly put out at not being given similar
ones, and each time that he arranged his collar, I felt that he
was doing so on purpose to offend me. But, what tormented me most
of all was the idea that Woloda could see through me, yet did not
choose to show it.

Who has not known those secret, wordless communications which
spring from some barely perceptible smile or movement--from a
casual glance between two persons who live as constantly together
as do brothers, friends, man and wife, or master and servant--
particularly if those two persons do not in all things cultivate
mutual frankness? How many half-expressed wishes, thoughts, and
meanings which one shrinks from revealing are made plain by a
single accidental glance which timidly and irresolutely meets the
eye!

However, in my own case I may have been deceived by my excessive
capacity for, and love of, analysis. Possibly Woloda did not feel
at all as I did. Passionate and frank, but unstable in his
likings, he was attracted by the most diverse things, and always
surrendered himself wholly to such attraction. For instance, he
suddenly conceived a passion for pictures, spent all his money on
their purchase, begged Papa, Grandmamma, and his drawing master
to add to their number, and applied himself with enthusiasm to
art. Next came a sudden rage for curios, with which he covered
his table, and for which he ransacked the whole house. Following
upon that, he took to violent novel-reading--procuring such
works by stealth, and devouring them day and night. Involuntarily
I was influenced by his whims, for, though too proud to imitate
him, I was also too young and too lacking in independence to
choose my own way. Above all, I envied Woloda his happy, nobly
frank character, which showed itself most strikingly when we
quarrelled. I always felt that he was in the right, yet could
not imitate him. For instance, on one occasion when his passion
for curios was at its height, I went to his table and
accidentally broke an empty many-coloured smelling-bottle.

"Who gave you leave to touch my things?" asked Woloda, chancing
to enter the room at that moment and at once perceiving the
disorder which I had occasioned in the orderly arrangement of the
treasures on his table. "And where is that smelling bottle?
Perhaps you--?"

"I let it fall, and it smashed to pieces; but what does that
matter?"

"Well, please do me the favour never to DARE to touch my things
again," he said as he gathered up the broken fragments and looked
at them vexedly.

"And will YOU please do me the favour never to ORDER me to do
anything whatever," I retorted. "When a thing's broken, it's
broken, and there is no more to be said." Then I smiled, though I
hardly felt like smiling.

"Oh, it may mean nothing to you, but to me it means a good deal,"
said Woloda, shrugging his shoulders (a habit he had caught from
Papa). "First of all you go and break my things, and then you
laugh. What a nuisance a little boy can be!"

"LITTLE boy, indeed? Then YOU, I suppose, are a man, and ever so
wise?"

"I do not intend to quarrel with you," said Woloda, giving me a
slight push. "Go away."

"Don't you push me!"

"Go away."

"I say again--don't you push me!"

Woloda took me by the hand and tried to drag me away from the
table, but I was excited to the last degree, and gave the table
such a push with my foot that I upset the whole concern, and
brought china and crystal ornaments and everything else with a
crash to the floor.

"You disgusting little brute!" exclaimed Woloda, trying to save
some of his falling treasures.

"At last all is over between us," I thought to myself as I strode
from the room. "We are separated now for ever."

It was not until evening that we again exchanged a word. Yet I
felt guilty, and was afraid to look at him, and remained at a
loose end all day.

Woloda, on the contrary, did his lessons as diligently as ever,
and passed the time after luncheon in talking and laughing with
the girls. As soon, again, as afternoon lessons were over I left
the room, for it would have been terribly embarrassing for me to
be alone with my brother. When, too, the evening class in history
was ended I took my notebook and moved towards the door. Just as
I passed Woloda, I pouted and pulled an angry face, though in
reality I should have liked to have made my peace with him. At
the same moment he lifted his head, and with a barely perceptible
and good-humouredly satirical smile looked me full in the face.
Our eyes met, and I saw that he understood me, while he, for his
part, saw that I knew that he understood me; yet a feeling
stronger than myself obliged me to turn away from him.

"Nicolinka," he said in a perfectly simple and anything but mock-
pathetic way, "you have been angry with me long enough. I am
sorry if I offended you," and he tendered me his hand.

It was as though something welled up from my heart and nearly
choked me. Presently it passed away, the tears rushed to my eyes,
and I felt immensely relieved.

"I too am so-rry, Wo-lo-da," I said, taking his hand. Yet he only
looked at me with an expression as though he could not understand
why there should be tears in my eyes.



VI. MASHA

None of the changes produced in my conception of things were so
striking as the one which led me to cease to see in one of our
chambermaids a mere servant of the female sex, but, on the
contrary, a WOMAN upon whom depended, to a certain extent, my
peace of mind and happiness. From the time of my earliest
recollection I can remember Masha an inmate of our house, yet
never until the occurrence of which I am going to speak--an
occurrence which entirely altered my impression of her--had I
bestowed the smallest attention upon her. She was twenty-five
years old, while I was but fourteen. Also, she was very
beautiful. But I hesitate to give a further description of her
lest my imagination should once more picture the bewitching,
though deceptive, conception of her which filled my mind during
the period of my passion. To be frank, I will only say that she
was extraordinarily handsome, magnificently developed, and a
woman--as also that I was but fourteen.

At one of those moments when, lesson-book in hand, I would pace
the room, and try to keep strictly to one particular crack in the
floor as I hummed a fragment of some tune or repeated some vague
formula--in short, at one of those moments when the mind leaves
off thinking and the imagination gains the upper hand and yearns
for new impressions--I left the schoolroom, and turned, with no
definite purpose in view, towards the head of the staircase.

Somebody in slippers was ascending the second flight of stairs.
Of course I felt curious to see who it was, but the footsteps
ceased abruptly, and then I heard Masha's voice say:

"Go away! What nonsense! What would Maria Ivanovna think if she
were to come now?"

"Oh, but she will not come," answered Woloda's voice in a
whisper.

"Well, go away, you silly boy," and Masha came running up, and
fled past me.

I cannot describe the way in which this discovery confounded me.
Nevertheless the feeling of amazement soon gave place to a kind
of sympathy with Woloda's conduct. I found myself wondering less
at the conduct itself than at his ability to behave so agreeably.
Also, I found myself involuntarily desiring to imitate him.

Sometimes I would pace the landing for an hour at a time, with no
other thought in my head than to watch for movements from above.
Yet, although I longed beyond all things to do as Woloda had
done, I could not bring myself to the point. At other times,
filled with a sense of envious jealousy, I would conceal myself
behind a door and listen to the sounds which came from the
maidservants' room, until the thought would occur to my mind,
"How if I were to go in now and, like Woloda, kiss Masha? What
should I say when she asked me--ME with the huge nose and the
tuft on the top of my head--what I wanted?" Sometimes, too, I
could hear her saying to Woloda,

"That serves you right! Go away! Nicolas Petrovitch never comes
in here with such nonsense." Alas! she did not know that Nicolas
Petrovitch was sitting on the staircase just below and feeling
that he would give all he possessed to be in "that bold fellow
Woloda's" place! I was shy by nature, and rendered worse in that
respect by a consciousness of my own ugliness. I am certain that
nothing so much influences the development of a man as his
exterior--though the exterior itself less than his belief in its
plainness or beauty.

Yet I was too conceited altogether to resign myself to my fate. I
tried to comfort myself much as the fox did when he declared that
the grapes were sour. That is to say, I tried to make light of
the satisfaction to be gained from making such use of a pleasing
exterior as I believed Woloda to employ (satisfaction which I
nevertheless envied him from my heart), and endeavoured with
every faculty of my intellect and imagination to console myself
with a pride in my isolation.



VII. SMALL SHOT

"Good gracious! Powder!" exclaimed Mimi in a voice trembling with
alarm. "Whatever are you doing? You will set the house on fire in
a moment, and be the death of us all!" Upon that, with an
indescribable expression of firmness, Mimi ordered every one to
stand aside, and, regardless of all possible danger from a
premature explosion, strode with long and resolute steps to where
some small shot was scattered about the floor, and began to
trample upon it.

When, in her opinion, the peril was at least lessened, she called
for Michael and commanded him to throw the "powder" away into
some remote spot, or, better still, to immerse it in water; after
which she adjusted her cap and returned proudly to the drawing-
room, murmuring as she went, "At least I can say that they are
well looked after."

When Papa issued from his room and took us to see Grandmamma we
found Mimi sitting by the window and glancing with a grave,
mysterious, official expression towards the door. In her hand she
was holding something carefully wrapped in paper. I guessed that
that something was the small shot, and that Grandmamma had been
informed of the occurrence. In the room also were the maidservant
Gasha (who, to judge by her angry flushed face, was in a state of
great irritation) and Doctor Blumenthal--the latter a little man
pitted with smallpox, who was endeavouring by tacit, pacificatory
signs with his head and eyes to reassure the perturbed Gasha.
Grandmamma was sitting a little askew and playing that variety of
"patience" which is called "The Traveller"--two unmistakable
signs of her displeasure.

"How are you to-day, Mamma?" said Papa as he kissed her hand
respectfully. "Have you had a good night?"

"Yes, very good, my dear; you KNOW that I always enjoy sound
health," replied Grandmamma in a tone implying that Papa's
inquiries were out of place and highly offensive. "Please give me
a clean pocket-handkerchief," she added to Gasha.

"I HAVE given you one, madam," answered Gasha, pointing to the
snow-white cambric handkerchief which she had just laid on the
arm of Grandmamma's chair.

"No, no; it's a nasty, dirty thing. Take it away and bring me a
CLEAN one, my dear."

Gasha went to a cupboard and slammed the door of it back so
violently that every window rattled. Grandmamma glared angrily at
each of us, and then turned her attention to following the
movements of the servant. After the latter had presented her with
what I suspected to be the same handkerchief as before,
Grandmamma continued:

"And when do you mean to cut me some snuff, my dear?"

"When I have time."

"What do you say?"

"To-day."

"If you don't want to continue in my service you had better say
so at once. I would have sent you away long ago had I known that
you wished it."

"It wouldn't have broken my heart if you had!" muttered the woman
in an undertone.

Here the doctor winked at her again, but she returned his gaze so
firmly and wrathfully that he soon lowered it and went on playing
with his watch-key.

"You see, my dear, how people speak to me in my own house!" said
Grandmamma to Papa when Gasha had left the room grumbling.

"Well, Mamma, I will cut you some snuff myself," replied Papa,
though evidently at a loss how to proceed now that he had made
this rash promise.

"No, no, I thank you. Probably she is cross because she knows
that no one except herself can cut the snuff just as I like it.
Do you know, my dear," she went on after a pause, "that your
children very nearly set the house on fire this morning?"

Papa gazed at Grandmamma with respectful astonishment.

"Yes, they were playing with something or another. Tell him the
story," she added to Mimi.

Papa could not help smiling as he took the shot in his hand.

"This is only small shot, Mamma," he remarked, "and could never
be dangerous."

"I thank you, my dear, for your instruction, but I am rather too
old for that sort of thing."

"Nerves, nerves!" whispered the doctor.

Papa turned to us and asked us where we had got the stuff, and
how we could dare to play with it.

"Don't ask THEM, ask that useless 'Uncle,' rather," put in
Grandmamma, laying a peculiar stress upon the word "UNCLE."
"What else is he for?"

"Woloda says that Karl Ivanitch gave him the powder himself,"
declared Mimi.

"Then you can see for yourself what use he is," continued
Grandmamma. " And where IS he--this precious 'Uncle'? How is one
to get hold of him? Send him here."

"He has gone an errand for me," said Papa.

"That is not at all right," rejoined Grandmamma. "He ought ALWAYS
to be here. True, the children are yours, not mine, and I have
nothing to do with them, seeing that you are so much cleverer
than I am; yet all the same I think it is time we had a regular
tutor for them, and not this 'Uncle' of a German--a stupid fellow
who knows only how to teach them rude manners and Tyrolean songs!
Is it necessary, I ask you, that they should learn Tyrolean
songs? However, there is no one for me to consult about it, and
you must do just as you like."

The word "NOW" meant "NOW THAT THEY HAVE NO MOTHER," and suddenly
awakened sad recollections in Grandmamma's heart. She threw a
glance at the snuff-box bearing Mamma's portrait and sighed.

"I thought of all this long ago," said Papa eagerly, "as well as
taking your advice on the subject. How would you like St. Jerome
to superintend their lessons?"

"Oh, I think he would do excellently, my friend," said Grandmamma
in a mollified tone, "He is at least a tutor comme il faut, and
knows how to instruct des enfants de bonne maison. He is not a
mere 'Uncle' who is good only for taking them out walking."

"Very well; I will talk to him to-morrow," said Papa. And, sure
enough, two days later saw Karl Ivanitch forced to retire in
favour of the young Frenchman referred to.



VIII. KARL IVANITCH'S HISTORY

THE evening before the day when Karl was to leave us for ever, he
was standing (clad, as usual, in his wadded dressing-gown and red
cap) near the bed in his room, and bending down over a trunk as
he carefully packed his belongings.

His behaviour towards us had been very cool of late, and he had
seemed to shrink from all contact with us. Consequently, when I
entered his room on the present occasion, he only glanced at me
for a second and then went on with his occupation. Even though I
proceeded to jump on to his bed (a thing hitherto always
forbidden me to do), he said not a word; and the idea that he
would soon be scolding or forgiving us no longer--no longer
having anything to do with us--reminded me vividly of the
impending separation. I felt grieved to think that he had ceased
to love us and wanted to show him my grief.

"Will you let me help you?" I said, approaching him.

He looked at me for a moment and turned away again. Yet the
expression of pain in his eyes showed that his coldness was not
the result of indifference, but rather of sincere and
concentrated sorrow.

"God sees and knows everything," he said at length, raising
himself to his full height and drawing a deep sigh. "Yes,
Nicolinka," he went on, observing, the expression of sincere pity
on my face, " my fate has been an unhappy one from the cradle,
and will continue so to the grave. The good that I have done to
people has always been repaid with evil; yet, though I shall
receive no reward here, I shall find one THERE" (he pointed
upwards). "Ah, if only you knew my whole story, and all that I
have endured in this life!--I who have been a bootmaker, a
soldier, a deserter, a factory hand, and a teacher! Yet now--now
I am nothing, and, like the Son of Man, have nowhere to lay my
head." Sitting down upon a chair, he covered his eyes with his
hand.

Seeing that he was in the introspective mood in which a man pays
no attention to his listener as he cons over his secret thoughts,
I remained silent, and, seating myself upon the bed, continued to
watch his kind face.

"You are no longer a child. You can understand things now, and I
will tell you my whole story and all that I have undergone. Some
day, my children, you may remember the old friend who loved you
so much--"

He leant his elbow upon the table by his side, took a pinch of
snuff, and, in the peculiarly measured, guttural tone in which he
used to dictate us our lessons, began the story of his career.

Since he many times in later years repeated the whole to me
again--always in the same order, and with the same expressions
and the same unvarying intonation--I will try to render it
literally, and without omitting the innumerable grammatical
errors into which he always strayed when speaking in Russian.
Whether it was really the history of his life, or whether it was
the mere product of his imagination--that is to say, some
narrative which he had conceived during his lonely residence in
our house, and had at last, from endless repetition, come to
believe in himself--or whether he was adorning with imaginary
facts the true record of his career, I have never quite been able
to make out. On the one hand, there was too much depth of feeling
and practical consistency in its recital for it to be wholly
incredible, while, on the other hand, the abundance of poetical
beauty which it contained tended to raise doubts in the mind of
the listener.

"Me vere very unhappy from ze time of my birth," he began with a
profound sigh. "Ze noble blot of ze Countess of Zomerblat flows
in my veins. Me vere born six veek after ze vetting. Ze man of my
Mutter (I called him 'Papa') vere farmer to ze Count von
Zomerblat. He coult not forget my Mutter's shame, ant loaft me
not. I had a youngster broser Johann ant two sister, pot me vere
strange petween my own family. Ven Johann mate several silly
trick Papa sayt, 'Wit sis chilt Karl I am never to have one
moment tranquil!' and zen he scoltet and ponishet me. Ven ze
sister quarrellet among zemselves Papa sayt, 'Karl vill never be
one opedient poy,' ant still scoltet ant ponishet me. My goot
Mamma alone loaft ant tenteret me. Often she sayt to me, 'Karl,
come in my room,' ant zere she kisset me secretly. 'Poorly,
poorly Karl!' she sayt. 'Nopoty loaf you, pot I will not exchange
you for somepoty in ze worlt, One zing your Mutter pegs you,
to rememper,' sayt she to me, 'learn vell, ant be efer one
honest man; zen Got will not forsake you.' Ant I triet so
to become. Ven my fourteen year hat expiret, ant me coult
partake of ze Holy Sopper, my Mutter sayt to my Vater, 'Karl
is one pig poy now, Kustaf. Vat shall we do wis him?' Ant
Papa sayt, 'Me ton't know.' Zen Mamma sayt, 'Let us give
him to town at Mister Schultzen's, and he may pea Schumacher,'
ant my Vater sayt, 'Goot !' Six year ant seven mons livet I
in town wis ze Mister Shoemaker, ant he loaft me. He sayt,
'Karl are one goot vorkman, ant shall soon become my Geselle.'
Pot-man makes ze proposition, ant Got ze deposition. In
ze year 1796 one conscription took place, ant each which vas
serviceable, from ze eighteens to ze twenty-first year, hat to go
to town.

"My Fater and my broser Johann come to town, ant ve go togezer to
throw ze lot for which shoult pe Soldat. Johann drew ze fatal
nomper, and me vas not necessary to pe Soldat. Ant Papa sayt, 'I
have only vun son, ant wis him I must now separate!'

"Den I take his hant, ant says, 'Why say you so, Papa? Come wis
me, ant I will say you somesing.' Ant Papa come, ant we seat
togezer at ze publics-house, ant me sayt, 'Vaiter, give us one
Bierkrug,' ant he gives us one. We trink altogezer, and broser
Johann also trink. 'Papa,' sayt me, 'ton't say zat you have only
one son, ant wis it you must separate, My heart was breaking ven
you say sis. Broser Johann must not serve; ME shall pe Soldat.
Karl is for nopoty necessary, and Karl shall pe Soldat.'

"'You is one honest man, Karl,' sayt Papa, ant kiss me. Ant me
was Soldat."



IX. CONTINUATION OF KARL'S NARRATIVE

"Zat was a terrible time, Nicolinka," continued Karl Ivanitch,
"ze time of Napoleon. He vanted to conquer Germany, ant we
protected our Vaterland to ze last trop of plot. Me vere at Ulm,
me vere at Austerlitz, me vere at Wagram."

"Did you really fight?" I asked with a gaze of astonishment "Did
you really kill anybody?"

Karl instantly reassured me on this point,

"Vonce one French grenadier was left behint, ant fell to ze
grount. I
sprang forvarts wis my gon, ant vere about to kill him, aber der
Franzose warf sein Gewehr hin und rief, 'Pardon'--ant I let him
loose.

"At Wagram, Napoleon cut us open, ant surrountet us in such a way
as zere vas no helping. Sree days hat we no provisions, ant stoot
in ze vater op to ze knees. Ze evil Napoleon neiser let us go
loose nor catchet us.

"On ze fours day zey took us prisoners--zank Got! ant sent us to
one fortress. Upon me vas one blue trousers, uniforms of very
goot clos, fifteen of Thalers, ant one silver clock which my
Vater hat given me, Ze Frans Soldaten took from me everysing. For
my happiness zere vas sree tucats on me which my Mamma hat sewn
in my shirt of flannel. Nopoty fount zem.

"I liket not long to stay in ze fortresses, ant resoluted to ron
away. Von day, von pig holitay, says I to the sergeant which hat
to look after us, 'Mister Sergeant, to-day is a pig holitay, ant
me vants to celeprate it. Pring here, if you please, two pottle
Mateira, ant we shall trink zem wis each oser.' Ant ze sergeant
says, 'Goot!' Ven ze sergeant pring ze Mateira ant we trink it
out to ze last trop, I taket his hant ant says, 'Mister Sergeant,
perhaps you have still one Vater and one Mutter?' He says, 'So I
have, Mister Mayer.' 'My Vater ant Mutter not seen me eight
year,' I goes on to him, 'ant zey know not if I am yet alive or
if my bones be reposing in ze grave. Oh, Mister Sergeant, I have
two tucats which is in my shirt of flannel. Take zem, ant let me
loose! You will pe my penefactor, ant my Mutter will be praying
for you all her life to ze Almighty Got!'

"Ze sergeant emptiet his glass of Mateira, ant says, 'Mister
Mayer, I loaf and pity you very much, pot you is one prisoner,
ant I one soldat.' So I take his hant ant says, 'Mister
Sergeant!'

"Ant ze sergeant says, 'You is one poor man, ant I will not take
your money, pot I will help you. Ven I go to sleep, puy one pail
of pranty for ze Soldaten, ant zey will sleep. Me will not look
after you.' Sis was one goot man. I puyet ze pail of pranty, ant
ven ze Soldaten was trunken me tresset in one olt coat, ant gang
in silence out of ze doon.

"I go to ze wall, ant will leap down, pot zere is vater pelow,
ant I will not spoil my last tressing, so I go to ze gate.

"Ze sentry go up and town wis one gon, ant look at me. 'Who goes
zere? ' ant I was silent. 'Who goes zere ze second time?' ant I
was silent. ' Who goes zere ze third time? ' ant I ron away, I
sprang in ze vater, climp op to ze oser site, ant walk on.

"Ze entire night I ron on ze vay, pot ven taylight came I was
afrait zat zey woult catch me, ant I hit myself in ze high corn.
Zere I kneelet town, zanket ze Vater in Heaven for my safety, ant
fall asleep wis a tranquil feeling.

"I wakenet op in ze evening, ant gang furser. At once one large
German carriage, wis two raven-black horse, came alongside me. In
ze carriage sit one well-tresset man, smoking pipe, ant look at
me. I go slowly, so zat ze carriage shall have time to pass me,
pot I go slowly, ant ze carriage go slowly, ant ze man look at
me. I go quick, ant ze carriage go quick, ant ze man stop its two
horses, ant look at me. 'Young man,' says he, 'where go you so
late?' I says, 'I go to Frankfort.' 'Sit in ze carriage--zere is
room enough, ant I will trag you,' he says. 'Bot why have you
nosing about you? Your boots is dirty, ant your beart not
shaven.' I seated wis him, ant says, 'lch bin one poor man, ant I
would like to pusy myself wis somesing in a manufactory. My
tressing is dirty because I fell in ze mud on ze roat.'

"'You tell me ontruse, young man,' says he. 'Ze roat is kvite dry
now.' I was silent. 'Tell me ze whole truse,' goes on ze goot
man--'who you are, ant vere you go to? I like your face, ant ven
you is one honest man, so I will help you.' Ant I tell all.

"'Goot, young man!' he says. 'Come to my manufactory of rope, ant
I will give you work ant tress ant money, ant you can live wis
os.' I says, 'Goot!'

"I go to ze manufactory of rope, ant ze goot man says to his
voman, 'Here is one yong man who defented his Vaterland, ant ron
away from prisons. He has not house nor tresses nor preat. He
will live wis os. Give him clean linen, ant norish him.'

"I livet one ant a half year in ze manufactory of rope, ant my
lantlort loaft me so much zat he would not let me loose. Ant I
felt very goot.

"I were zen handsome man--yong, of pig stature, with blue eyes
and romische nose--ant Missis L-- (I like not to say her name--
she was ze voman of my lantlort) was yong ant handsome laty. Ant
she fell in loaf wis me."

Here Karl Ivanitch made a long pause, lowered his kindly blue
eyes, shook his head quietly, and smiled as people always do
under the influence of a pleasing recollection.

"Yes," he resumed as he leant back in his arm-chair and adjusted
his dressing-gown, "I have experiencet many sings in my life, pot
zere is my witness,"--here he pointed to an image of the Saviour,
embroidered on wool, which was hanging over his bed--"zat nopoty
in ze worlt can say zat Karl Ivanitch has been one dishonest man,
I would not repay black ingratitude for ze goot which Mister L--
dit me, ant I resoluted to ron away. So in ze evening, ven all
were asleep, I writet one letter to my lantlort, ant laid it on
ze table in his room. Zen I taket my tresses, tree Thaler of
money, ant go mysteriously into ze street. Nopoty have seen me,
ant I go on ze roat."



X. CONCLUSION OF KARL'S NARRATIVE

"I had not seen my Mamma for nine year, ant I know not whether
she lived or whether her bones had long since lain in ze dark
grave. Ven I come to my own country and go to ze town I ask,
'Where live Kustaf Mayer who was farmer to ze Count von
Zomerblat? ' ant zey answer me, 'Graf Zomerblat is deat, ant
Kustaf Mayer live now in ze pig street, ant keep a public-house.'
So I tress in my new waistcoat and one noble coat which ze
manufacturist presented me, arranged my hairs nice, ant go to ze
public-house of my Papa. Sister Mariechen vas sitting on a pench,
and she ask me what I want. I says, 'Might I trink one glass of
pranty?' ant she says, 'Vater, here is a yong man who wish to
trink one glass of pranty.' Ant Papa says, 'Give him ze glass.' I
set to ze table, trink my glass of pranty, smoke my pipe, ant
look at Papa, Mariechen, ant Johann (who also come into ze shop).
In ze conversation Papa says, 'You know, perhaps, yong man, where
stants our army?' and I say, 'I myself am come from ze army, ant
it stants now at Wien.' 'Our son,' says Papa, 'is a Soldat, ant
now is it nine years since he wrote never one wort, and we know
not whether he is alive or dead. My voman cry continually for
him.' I still fumigate the pipe, ant say, 'What was your son's
name, and where servet he? Perhaps I may know him.' 'His name was
Karl Mayer, ant he servet in ze Austrian Jagers.' 'He were of pig
stature, ant a handsome man like yourself,' puts in Mariechen. I
say, 'I know your Karl.' 'Amalia,' exclaimet my Vater. 'Come
here! Here is yong man which knows our Karl!'--ant my dear Mutter
comes out from a back door. I knew her directly. 'You know our
Karl?' says she, ant looks at me, ant, white all over, trembles.
'Yes, I haf seen him,' I says, without ze corage to look at her,
for my heart did almost burst. 'My Karl is alive?' she cry. 'Zen

see him once more--my darling son! Bot Got will not haf it so.'
Then she cried, and I coult no longer stant it. 'Darling Mamma!'
I say, 'I am your son, I am your Karl!'--and she fell into my
arms.

Karl Ivanitch covered his eyes, and his lips were quivering.

"'Mutter,' sagte ich, 'ich bin ihr Sohn, ich bin ihr Karl!'--und
sie sturtzte mir in die Arme!'" he repeated, recovering a little
and wiping the tears from his eyes.

"Bot Got did not wish me to finish my tays in my own town. I were
pursuet by fate. I livet in my own town only sree mons. One
Suntay I sit in a coffee-house, ant trinket one pint of Pier, ant

to him, and kissed me on the forehead.



XI. ONE MARK ONLY

The year of mourning over, Grandmamma recovered a little from her
grief, and once more took to receiving occasional guests,
especially children of the same age as ourselves.

On the 13th of December--Lubotshka's birthday--the Princess
Kornakoff and her daughters, with Madame Valakhin, Sonetchka,
Ilinka Grap, and the two younger Iwins, arrived at our house
before luncheon.

Though we could hear the sounds of talking, laughter, and
movements going on in the drawing-room, we could not join the
party until our morning lessons were finished. The table of
studies in the schoolroom said, " Lundi, de 2 a 3, maitre
d'Histoire et de Geographie," and this infernal maitre d'Histoire
we must await, listen to, and see the back of before we could
gain our liberty. Already it was twenty minutes past two, and
nothing was to be heard of the tutor, nor yet anything to be seen
of him in the street, although I kept looking up and down it with
the greatest impatience and with an emphatic longing never to see
the maitre again.

"I believe he is not coming to-day," said Woloda, looking up for
a moment from his lesson-book.

"I hope he is not, please the Lord!" I answered, but in a
despondent tone. "Yet there he DOES come, I believe, all the
same!"

"Not he! Why, that is a GENTLEMAN," said Woloda, likewise looking
out of the window, "Let us wait till half-past two, and then ask
St. Jerome if we may put away our books."

"Yes, and wish them au revoir," I added, stretching my arms, with
the book clasped in my hands, over my head. Having hitherto idled
away my time, I now opened the book at the place where the lesson
was to begin, and started to learn it. It was long and difficult,
and, moreover, I was in the mood when one's thoughts refuse to be
arrested by anything at all. Consequently I made no progress.
After our last lesson in history (which always seemed to me a
peculiarly arduous and wearisome subject) the history master had
complained to St. Jerome of me because only two good marks stood
to my credit in the register --a very small total. St. Jerome had
then told me that if I failed to gain less than THREE marks at
the next lesson I should be severely punished. The next lesson
was now imminent, and I confess that I felt a little nervous.

So absorbed, however, did I become in my reading that the sound
of goloshes being taken off in the ante-room came upon me almost
as a shock. I had just time to look up when there appeared in the
doorway the servile and (to me) very disgusting face and form of
the master, clad in a blue frockcoat with brass buttons.

Slowly he set down his hat and books and adjusted the folds of
his coat (as though such a thing were necessary!), and seated
himself in his place.

"Well, gentlemen," he said, rubbing his hands, "let us first of
all repeat the general contents of the last lesson: after which I
will proceed to narrate the succeeding events of the middle
ages."

This meant "Say over the last lesson." While Woloda was answering
the master with the entire ease and confidence which come of
knowing a subject well, I went aimlessly out on to the landing,
and, since I was not allowed to go downstairs, what more natural
than that I should involuntarily turn towards the alcove on the
landing? Yet before I had time to establish myself in my usual
coign of vantage behind the door I found myself pounced upon by
Mimi--always the cause of my misfortunes!

"YOU here?" she said, looking severely, first at myself, and
then at the maidservants' door, and then at myself again.

I felt thoroughly guilty, firstly, because I was not in the
schoolroom, and secondly, because I was in a forbidden place. So
I remained silent, and, dropping my head, assumed a touching
expression of contrition.

"Indeed, this is TOO bad!" Mimi went on, "What are you doing
here?

Still I said nothing.

"Well, it shall not rest where it is," she added, tapping the
banister with her yellow fingers. "I shall inform the Countess."

It was five minutes to three when I re-entered the schoolroom.
The master, as though oblivious of my presence or absence, was
explaining the new lesson to Woloda. When he had finished doing
this, and had put his books together (while Woloda went into the
other room to fetch his ticket), the comforting idea occurred to
me that perhaps the whole thing was over now, and that the master
had forgotten me.

But suddenly he turned in my direction with a malicious smile,
and said as he rubbed his hands anew, "I hope you have learnt
your lesson?"

"Yes," I replied.

"Would you be so kind, then, as to tell me something about St.
Louis' Crusade?" he went on, balancing himself on his chair and
looking gravely at his feet. "Firstly, tell me something about
the reasons which induced the French king to assume the cross
(here he raised his eyebrows and pointed to the inkstand); then
explain to me the general characteristics of the Crusade (here he
made a sweeping gesture with his hand, as though to seize hold of
something with it); "and lastly, expound to me the influence of
this Crusade upon the European states in general" (drawing the
copy books to the left side of the table) "and upon the French
state in particular" (drawing one of them to the right, and
inclining his head in the same direction).

I swallowed a few times, coughed, bent forward, and was silent.
Then, taking a pen from the table, I began to pick it to pieces,
yet still said nothing.

"Allow me the pen--I shall want it," said the master. "Well?"

"Louis the-er-Saint was-was-a very good and wise king."

"What?"

"King, He took it into his head to go to Jerusalem, and handed
over the reins of government to his mother,"

"What was her name?

"B-b-b-lanka."

"What? Belanka?"

I laughed in a rather forced manner.

"Well, is that all you know?" he asked again, smiling.

I had nothing to lose now, so I began chattering the first thing
that came into my head. The master remained silent as he gathered
together the remains of the pen which I had left strewn about the
table, looked gravely past my ear at the wall, and repeated from
time to time, "Very well, very well." Though I was conscious that
I knew nothing whatever and was expressing myself all wrong, I
felt much hurt at the fact that he never either corrected or
interrupted me.

"What made him think of going to Jerusalem?" he asked at last,
repeating some words of my own.

"Because--because--that is to say--"

My confusion was complete, and I relapsed into silence, I felt
that, even if this disgusting history master were to go on
putting questions to me, and gazing inquiringly into my face, for
a year, I should never be able to enunciate another syllable.
After staring at me for some three minutes, he suddenly assumed a
mournful cast of countenance, and said in an agitated voice to
Woloda (who was just re-entering the room):

"Allow me the register. I will write my remarks."

He opened the book thoughtfully, and in his fine caligraphy
marked FIVE for Woloda for diligence, and the same for good
behaviour. Then, resting his pen on the line where my report was
to go, he looked at me and reflected. Suddenly his hand made a
decisive movement and, behold, against my name stood a clearly-
marked ONE, with a full stop after it! Another movement and in
the behaviour column there stood another one and another full
stop! Quietly closing the book, the master then rose, and moved
towards the door as though unconscious of my look of entreaty,
despair, and reproach.

"Michael Lavionitch!" I said.

"No!" he replied, as though knowing beforehand what I was about
to say. "It is impossible for you to learn in that way. I am not
going to earn my money for nothing."

He put on his goloshes and cloak, and then slowly tied a scarf
about his neck. To think that he could care about such trifles
after what had just happened to me! To him it was all a mere
stroke of the pen, but to me it meant the direst misfortune.

"Is the lesson over?" asked St. Jerome, entering.

"Yes."

"And was the master pleased with you?"

"Yes."

"How many marks did he give you?"

"Five."

"And to Nicholas?"

I was silent.

"I think four," said Woloda. His idea was to save me for at least
today. If punishment there must be, it need not be awarded while
we had guests.

"Voyons, Messieurs!" (St. Jerome was forever saying "Voyons!")
"Faites votre toilette, et descendons."



XII. THE KEY

We had hardly descended and greeted our guests when luncheon was
announced. Papa was in the highest of spirits since for some
time past he had been winning. He had presented Lubotshka with a
silver tea service, and suddenly remembered, after luncheon, that
he had forgotten a box of bonbons which she was to have too.

"Why send a servant for it? YOU had better go, Koko," he said to
me jestingly. "The keys are in the tray on the table, you know.
Take them, and with the largest one open the second drawer on the
right. There you will find the box of bonbons. Bring it here."

"Shall I get you some cigars as well?" said I, knowing that he
always smoked after luncheon.

"Yes, do; but don't touch anything else."

I found the keys, and was about to carry out my orders, when I
was seized with a desire to know what the smallest of the keys on
the bunch belonged to.

On the table I saw, among many other things, a padlocked
portfolio, and at once felt curious to see if that was what the
key fitted. My experiment was crowned with success. The portfolio
opened and disclosed a number of papers. Curiosity so strongly
urged me also to ascertain what those papers contained that the
voice of conscience was stilled, and I began to read their
contents. . . .

My childish feeling of unlimited respect for my elders,
especially for Papa, was so strong within me that my intellect
involuntarily refused to draw any conclusions from what I had
seen. I felt that Papa was living in a sphere completely apart
from, incomprehensible by, and unattainable for, me, as well as
one that was in every way excellent, and that any attempt on my
part to criticise the secrets of his life would constitute
something like sacrilege.

For this reason, the discovery which I made from Papa's portfolio
left no clear impression upon my mind, but only a dim
consciousness that I had done wrong. I felt ashamed and confused.

The feeling made me eager to shut the portfolio again as quickly
as possible, but it seemed as though on this unlucky day I was
destined to experience every possible kind of adversity. I put
the key back into the padlock and turned it round, but not in the
right direction. Thinking that the portfolio was now locked, I
pulled at the key and, oh horror! found my hand come away with
only the top half of the key in it! In vain did I try to put the
two halves together, and to extract the portion that was sticking
in the padlock. At last I had to resign myself to the dreadful
thought that I had committed a new crime --one which would be
discovered to-day as soon as ever Papa returned to his study!
First of all, Mimi's accusation on the staircase, and then that
one mark, and then this key! Nothing worse could happen now. This
very evening I should be assailed successively by Grandmamma
(because of Mimi's denunciation), by St. Jerome (because of the
solitary mark), and by Papa (because of the matter of this key)--
yes, all in one evening!

"What on earth is to become of me? What have I done?" I exclaimed
as I paced the soft carpet. "Well," I went on with sudden
determination, "what MUST come, MUST--that's all;" and, taking up
the bonbons and the cigars, I ran back to the other part of the
house.

The fatalistic formula with which I had concluded (and which was
one that I often heard Nicola utter during my childhood) always
produced in me, at the more difficult crises of my life, a
momentarily soothing, beneficial effect. Consequently, when I re-
entered the drawing-room, I was in a rather excited, unnatural
mood, yet one that was perfectly cheerful.



XIII. THE TRAITRESS

After luncheon we began to play at round games, in which I took a
lively part. While indulging in "cat and mouse", I happened to
cannon rather awkwardly against the Kornakoffs' governess, who
was playing with us, and, stepping on her dress, tore a large
hole in it. Seeing that the girls--particularly Sonetchka--were
anything but displeased at the spectacle of the governess angrily
departing to the maidservants' room to have her dress mended, I
resolved to procure them the satisfaction a second time.
Accordingly, in pursuance of this amiable resolution, I waited
until my victim returned, and then began to gallop madly round
her, until a favourable moment occurred for once more planting my
heel upon her dress and reopening the rent. Sonetchka and the
young princesses had much ado to restrain their laughter, which
excited my conceit the more, but St. Jerome, who had probably
divined my tricks, came up to me with the frown which I could
never abide in him, and said that, since I seemed disposed to
mischief, he would have to send me away if I did not moderate my
behaviour.

However, I was in the desperate position of a person who, having
staked more than he has in his pocket, and feeling that he can
never make up his account, continues to plunge on unlucky cards--
not because he hopes to regain his losses, but because it will
not do for him to stop and consider. So, I merely laughed in an
impudent fashion and flung away from my monitor.

After "cat and mouse", another game followed in which the
gentlemen sit on one row of chairs and the ladies on another, and
choose each other for partners. The youngest princess always
chose the younger Iwin, Katenka either Woloda or Ilinka, and
Sonetchka Seriosha --nor, to my extreme astonishment, did
Sonetchka seem at all embarrassed when her cavalier went and sat
down beside her. On the contrary, she only laughed her sweet,
musical laugh, and made a sign with her head that he had chosen
right. Since nobody chose me, I always had the mortification of
finding myself left over, and of hearing them say, "Who has been
left out? Oh, Nicolinka. Well, DO take him, somebody."
Consequently, whenever it came to my turn to guess who had chosen
me, I had to go either to my sister or to one of the ugly elder
princesses. Sonetchka seemed so absorbed in Seriosha that in her
eyes I clearly existed no longer. I do not quite know why I
called her "the traitress" in my thoughts, since she had never
promised to choose me instead of Seriosha, but, for all that, I
felt convinced that she was treating me in a very abominable
fashion. After the game was finished, I actually saw "the
traitress" (from whom I nevertheless could not withdraw my eyes)
go with Seriosha and Katenka into a corner, and engage in secret
confabulation. Stealing softly round the piano which masked the
conclave, I beheld the following:

Katenka was holding up a pocket-handkerchief by two of its
corners, so as to form a screen for the heads of her two
companions. "No, you have lost! You must pay the forfeit!" cried
Seriosha at that moment, and Sonetchka, who was standing in front
of him, blushed like a criminal as she replied, "No, I have NOT
lost! HAVE I, Mademoiselle Katherine?" "Well, I must speak the
truth," answered Katenka, "and say that you HAVE lost, my dear."
Scarcely had she spoken the words when Seriosha embraced
Sonetchka, and kissed her right on her rosy lips! And Sonetchka
smiled as though it were nothing, but merely something very
pleasant!

Horrors! The artful "traitress!"



XIV. THE RETRIBUTION

Instantly, I began to feel a strong contempt for the female sex
in general and Sonetchka in particular. I began to think that
there was nothing at all amusing in these games--that they were
only fit for girls, and felt as though I should like to make a
great noise, or to do something of such extraordinary boldness
that every one would be forced to admire it. The opportunity soon
arrived. St. Jerome said something to Mimi, and then left the
room, I could hear his footsteps ascending the staircase, and
then passing across the schoolroom, and the idea occurred to me
that Mimi must have told him her story about my being found on
the landing, and thereupon he had gone to look at the register.
(In those days, it must be remembered, I believed that St.
Jerome's whole aim in life was to annoy me.) Some where I have
read that, not infrequently, children of from twelve to fourteen
years of age--that is to say, children just passing from
childhood to adolescence--are addicted to incendiarism, or even
to murder. As I look back upon my childhood, and particularly
upon the mood in which I was on that (for myself) most unlucky
day, I can quite understand the possibility of such terrible
crimes being committed by children without any real aim in view--
without any real wish to do wrong, but merely out of curiosity or
under the influence of an unconscious necessity for action. There
are moments when the human being sees the future in such lurid
colours that he shrinks from fixing his mental eye upon it, puts
a check upon all his intellectual activity, and tries to feel
convinced that the future will never be, and that the past has
never been. At such moments--moments when thought does not shrink
from manifestations of will, and the carnal instincts alone
constitute the springs of life--I can understand that want of
experience (which is a particularly predisposing factor in this
connection) might very possibly lead a child, aye, without fear
or hesitation, but rather with a smile of curiosity on its face,
to set fire to the house in which its parents and brothers and
sisters (beings whom it tenderly loves) are lying asleep. It
would be under the same influence of momentary absence of
thought--almost absence of mind--that a peasant boy of seventeen
might catch sight of the edge of a newly-sharpened axe reposing
near the bench on which his aged father was lying asleep, face
downwards, and suddenly raise the implement in order to observe
with unconscious curiosity how the blood would come spurting out
upon the floor if he made a wound in the sleeper's neck. It is
under the same influence--the same absence of thought, the same
instinctive curiosity--that a man finds delight in standing on
the brink of an abyss and thinking to himself, "How if I were to
throw myself down?" or in holding to his brow a loaded pistol and
wondering, "What if I were to pull the trigger?" or in feeling,
when he catches sight of some universally respected personage,
that he would like to go up to him, pull his nose hard, and say,
"How do you do, old boy?"

Under the spell, then, of this instinctive agitation and lack of
reflection I was moved to put out my tongue, and to say that I
would not move, when St. Jerome came down and told me that I had
behaved so badly that day, as well as done my lessons so ill,
that I had no right to be where I was, and must go upstairs
directly.

At first, from astonishment and anger, he could not utter a word.

"C'est bien!" he exclaimed eventually as he darted towards me.
"Several times have I promised to punish you, and you have been
saved from it by your Grandmamma, but now I see that nothing but
the cane will teach you obedience, and you shall therefore taste
it."

This was said loud enough for every one to hear. The blood rushed
to my heart with such vehemence that I could feel that organ
beating violently--could feel the colour rising to my cheeks and
my lips trembling. Probably I looked horrible at that moment,
for, avoiding my eye, St. Jerome stepped forward and caught me by
the hand. Hardly feeling his touch, I pulled away my hand in
blind fury, and with all my childish might struck him.

"What are you doing?" said Woloda, who had seen my behaviour, and
now approached me in alarm and astonishment.

"Let me alone!" I exclaimed, the tears flowing fast. "Not a
single one of you loves me or understands how miserable I am! You
are all of you odious and disgusting!" I added bluntly, turning
to the company at large.

At this moment St. Jerome--his face pale, but determined--
approached me again, and, with a movement too quick to admit of
any defence, seized my hands as with a pair of tongs, and dragged
me away. My head swam with excitement, and I can only remember
that, so long as I had strength to do it, I fought with head and
legs; that my nose several times collided with a pair of knees;
that my teeth tore some one's coat; that all around me I could
hear the shuffling of feet; and that I could smell dust and the
scent of violets with which St. Jerome used to perfume himself.

Five minutes later the door of the store-room closed behind me.

"Basil," said a triumphant but detestable voice, "bring me the
cane."



XV. DREAMS

Could I at that moment have supposed that I should ever live to
survive the misfortunes of that day, or that there would ever
come a time when I should be able to look back upon those
misfortunes composedly?

As I sat there thinking over what I had done, I could not imagine
what the matter had been with me. I only felt with despair that I
was for ever lost.

At first the most profound stillness reigned around me--at least,
so it appeared to me as compared with the violent internal
emotion which I had been experiencing; but by and by I began to
distinguish various sounds. Basil brought something downstairs
which he laid upon a chest outside. It sounded like a broom-
stick. Below me I could hear St. Jerome's grumbling voice
(probably he was speaking of me), and then children's voices and
laughter and footsteps; until in a few moments everything seemed
to have regained its normal course in the house, as though nobody
knew or cared to know that here was I sitting alone in the dark
store-room!

I did not cry, but something lay heavy, like a stone, upon my
heart. Ideas and pictures passed with extraordinary rapidity
before my troubled imagination, yet through their fantastic
sequence broke continually the remembrance of the misfortune
which had befallen me as I once again plunged into an
interminable labyrinth of conjectures as to the punishment, the
fate, and the despair that were awaiting me. The thought occurred
to me that there must be some reason for the general
dislike--even contempt--which I fancied to be felt for me by
others. I was firmly convinced that every one, from Grandmamma
down to the coachman Philip, despised me, and found pleasure in
my sufferings. Next an idea struck me that perhaps I was not the
son of my father and mother at all, nor Woloda's brother, but
only some unfortunate orphan who had been adopted by them out of
compassion, and this absurd notion not only afforded me a certain
melancholy consolation, but seemed to me quite probable. I found
it comforting to think that I was unhappy, not through my own
fault, but because I was fated to be so from my birth, and
conceived that my destiny was very much like poor Karl
Ivanitch's.

"Why conceal the secret any longer, now that I have discovered
it?" I reflected. "To-morrow I will go to Papa and say to him,
'It is in vain for you to try and conceal from me the mystery of
my birth. I know it already.' And he will answer me, 'What else
could I do, my good fellow? Sooner or later you would have had to
know that you are not my son, but were adopted as such.
Nevertheless, so long as you remain worthy of my love, I will
never cast you out.' Then I shall say, 'Papa, though I have no
right to call you by that name, and am now doing so for the last
time, I have always loved you, and shall always retain that love.
At the same time, while I can never forget that you have been my
benefactor, I cannot remain longer in your house. Nobody here
loves me, and St. Jerome has wrought my ruin. Either he or I must
go forth, since I cannot answer for myself. I hate the man so
that I could do anything--I could even kill him.' Papa will begin
to entreat me, but I shall make a gesture, and say, 'No, no, my
friend and benefactor! We cannot live together. Let me go'--and
for the last time I shall embrace him, and say in French, 'O mon
pere, O mon bienfaiteur, donne moi, pour la derniere fois, ta
benediction, et que la volonte de Dieu soit faite!'"

I sobbed bitterly at these thoughts as I sat on a trunk in that
dark storeroom. Then, suddenly recollecting the shameful
punishment which was awaiting me, I would find myself back again
in actuality, and the dreams had fled. Soon, again, I began to
fancy myself far away from the house and alone in the world. I
enter a hussar regiment and go to war. Surrounded by the foe on
every side, I wave my sword, and kill one of them and wound
another--then a third,--then a fourth. At last, exhausted with
loss of blood and fatigue, I fall to the ground and cry,
"Victory!" The general comes to look for me, asking, "Where is
our saviour?" whereupon I am pointed out to him. He embraces me,
and, in his turn, exclaims with tears of joy, "Victory!"  I
recover and, with my arm in a black sling, go to walk on the
boulevards. I am a general now. I meet the Emperor, who asks,
"Who is this young man who has been wounded?" He is told that it
is the famous hero Nicolas; whereupon he approaches me and says,
"My thanks to you! Whatsoever you may ask for, I will grant it."
To this I bow respectfully, and, leaning on my sword, reply, "I
am happy, most august Emperor, that I have been able to shed my
blood for my country. I would gladly have died for it. Yet, since
you are so generous as to grant any wish of mine, I venture to
ask of you permission to annihilate my enemy, the foreigner St.
Jerome" And then I step fiercely before St. Jerome and say, "YOU
were the cause of all my fortunes! Down now on your knees!"

Unfortunately this recalled to my mind the fact that at any
moment the REAL St. Jerome might be entering with the cane; so
that once more I saw myself, not a general and the saviour of my
country, but an unhappy, pitiful creature.

Then the idea of God occurred to me, and I asked Him boldly why
He had punished me thus, seeing that I had never forgotten to say
my prayers, either morning or evening. Indeed, I can positively
declare that it was during that hour in the store-room that I
took the first step towards the religious doubt which afterwards
assailed me during my youth (not that mere misfortune could
arouse me to infidelity and murmuring, but that, at moments of
utter contrition and solitude, the idea of the injustice of
Providence took root in me as readily as bad seed takes root in
land well soaked with rain). Also, I imagined that I was going to
die there and then, and drew vivid pictures of St. Jerome's
astonishment when he entered the store-room and found a corpse
there instead of myself! Likewise, recollecting what Natalia
Savishna had told me of the forty days during which the souls of
the departed must hover around their earthly home, I imagined
myself flying through the rooms of Grandmamma's house, and seeing
Lubotshka's bitter tears, and hearing Grandmamma's lamentations,
and listening to Papa and St. Jerome talking together. "He was a
fine boy," Papa would say with tears in his eyes. "Yes," St.
Jerome would reply, "but a sad scapegrace and good-for-nothing."
"But you should respect the dead," would expostulate Papa. "YOU
were the cause of his death; YOU frightened him until he could no
longer bear the thought of the humiliation which you were about
to inflict upon him. Away from me, criminal!" Upon that St.
Jerome would fall upon his knees and implore forgiveness, and
when the forty days were ended my soul would fly to Heaven, and
see there something wonderfully beautiful, white, and
transparent, and know that it was Mamma.

And that something would embrace and caress me. Yet, all at once,
I should feel troubled, and not know her. "If it be you," I
should say to her, "show yourself more distinctly, so that I may
embrace you in return." And her voice would answer me, "Do you
not feel happy thus?" and I should reply, "Yes, I do, but you
cannot REALLY caress me, and I cannot REALLY kiss your hand like
this." "But it is not necessary," she would say. "There can be
happiness here without that,"--and I should feel that it was so,
and we should ascend together, ever higher and higher, until--

Suddenly I feel as though I am being thrown down again, and find
myself sitting on the trunk in the dark store-room (my cheeks wet
with tears and my thoughts in a mist), yet still repeating the
words, "Let us ascend together, higher and higher." Indeed, it
was a long, long while before I could remember where I was, for
at that moment my mind's eye saw only a dark, dreadful,
illimitable void. I tried to renew the happy, consoling dream
which had been thus interrupted by the return to reality, but, to
my surprise, I found that, as soon as ever I attempted to
re-enter former dreams, their continuation became impossible,
while--which astonished me even more--they no longer gave me
pleasure.



XVI. "KEEP ON GRINDING, AND YOU'LL HAVE FLOUR"

I PASSED the night in the store-room, and nothing further
happened, except that on the following morning--a Sunday--I was
removed to a small chamber adjoining the schoolroom, and once
more shut up. I began to hope that my punishment was going to be
limited to confinement, and found my thoughts growing calmer
under the influence of a sound, soft sleep, the clear sunlight
playing upon the frost crystals of the windowpanes, and the
familiar noises in the street.

Nevertheless, solitude gradually became intolerable. I wanted to
move about, and to communicate to some one all that was lying
upon my heart, but not a living creature was near me. The
position was the more unpleasant because, willy-nilly, I could
hear St. Jerome walking about in his room, and softly whistling
some hackneyed tune. Somehow, I felt convinced that he was
whistling not because he wanted to, but because he knew it
annoyed me.

At two o'clock, he and Woloda departed downstairs, and Nicola
brought me up some luncheon. When I told him what I had done and
what was awaiting me he said:

"Pshaw, sir! Don't be alarmed. 'Keep on grinding, and you'll have
flour.'"

Although this expression (which also in later days has more than
once helped me to preserve my firmness of mind) brought me a
little comfort, the fact that I received, not bread and water
only, but a whole luncheon, and even dessert, gave me much to
think about. If they had sent me no dessert, it would have meant
that my punishment was to be limited to confinement; whereas it
was now evident that I was looked upon as not yet punished--that
I was only being kept away from the others, as an evil-doer,
until the due time of punishment. While I was still debating the
question, the key of my prison turned, and St. Jerome entered
with a severe, official air.

"Come down and see your Grandmamma," he said without looking at
me.

I should have liked first to have brushed my jacket, since it was
covered with dust, but St. Jerome said that that was quite
unnecessary, since I was in such a deplorable moral condition
that my exterior was not worth considering. As he led me through
the salon, Katenka, Lubotshka, and Woloda looked at me with much
the same expression as we were wont to look at the convicts who
on certain days filed past my grandmother's house. Likewise, when
I approached Grandmamma's arm-chair to kiss her hand, she
withdrew it, and thrust it under her mantilla.

"Well, my dear," she began after a long pause, during which she
regarded me from head to foot with the kind of expression which
makes one uncertain where to look or what to do, "I must say that
you seem to value my love very highly, and afford me great
consolation." Then she went on, with an emphasis on each word,
"Monsieur St. Jerome, who, at my request, undertook your
education, says that he can no longer remain in the house. And
why? Simply because of you." Another pause ensued. Presently she
continued in a tone which clearly showed that her speech had been
prepared beforehand, "I had hoped that you would be grateful for
all his care, and for all the trouble that he has taken with you,
that you would have appreciated his services; but you--you baby,
you silly boy!--you actually dare to raise your hand against him!
Very well, very good. I am beginning to think that you cannot
understand kind treatment, but require to be treated in a very
different and humiliating fashion. Go now directly and beg his
pardon," she added in a stern and peremptory tone as she pointed
to St. Jerome, "Do you hear me?"

I followed the direction of her finger with my eye, but on that
member alighting upon St. Jerome's coat, I turned my head away,
and once more felt my heart beating violently as I remained where
I was.

"What? Did you not hear me when I told you what to do?"

I was trembling all over, but I would not stir.

"Koko," went on my grandmother, probably divining my inward
sufferings, "Koko," she repeated in a voice tender rather than
harsh, "is this you?"

"Grandmamma, I cannot beg his pardon for--" and I stopped
suddenly, for I felt the next word refuse to come for the tears
that were choking me.

"But I ordered you, I begged of you, to do so. What is the matter
with you?"

"I-I-I will not--I cannot!" I gasped, and the tears, long pent up
and accumulated in my breast, burst forth like a stream which
breaks its dikes and goes flowing madly over the country.

"C'est ainsi que vous obeissez a votre seconde mere, c'est ainsi
que vous reconnaissez ses bontes!" remarked St. Jerome quietly,
"A genoux!"

"Good God! If SHE had seen this!" exclaimed Grandmamma, turning
from me and wiping away her tears. "If she had seen this! It may
be all for the best, yet she could never have survived such
grief--never!" and Grandmamma wept more and more. I too wept, but
it never occurred to me to ask for pardon.

"Tranquillisez-vous au nom du ciel, Madame la Comtesse," said St.
Jerome, but Grandmamma heard him not. She covered her face with
her hands, and her sobs soon passed to hiccups and hysteria. Mimi
and Gasha came running in with frightened faces, salts and
spirits were applied, and the whole house was soon in a ferment.

"You may feel pleased at your work," said St. Jerome to me as he
led me from the room.

"Good God! What have I done?" I thought to myself. "What a
terribly bad boy I am!"

As soon as St. Jerome, bidding me go into his room, had returned
to Grandmamma, I, all unconscious of what I was doing, ran down
the grand staircase leading to the front door. Whether I intended
to drown myself, or whether merely to run away from home, I do
not remember. I only know that I went blindly on, my face covered
with my hands that I might see nothing.

"Where are you going to?" asked a well-known voice. "I want you,
my boy."

I would have passed on, but Papa caught hold of me, and said
sternly:

"Come here, you impudent rascal. How could you dare to do such a
thing as to touch the portfolio in my study?" he went on as he
dragged me into his room. "Oh! you are silent, eh?" and he pulled
my ear.

"Yes, I WAS naughty," I said. "I don't know myself what came over
me then."

"So you don't know what came over you--you don't know, you don't
know? " he repeated as he pulled my ear harder and harder. "Will
you go and put your nose where you ought not to again--will you,
will you?"

Although my ear was in great pain, I did not cry, but, on the
contrary, felt a sort of morally pleasing sensation. No sooner
did he let go of my ear than I seized his hand and covered it
with tears and kisses.

"Please whip me!" I cried, sobbing. "Please hurt me the more and
more, for I am a wretched, bad, miserable boy!"

"Why, what on earth is the matter with you?" he said, giving me a
slight push from him.

"No, I will not go away!" I continued, seizing his coat. "Every
one else hates me--I know that, but do YOU listen to me and
protect me, or else send me away altogether. I cannot live with
HIM. He tries to humiliate me--he tells me to kneel before him,
and wants to strike me. I can't stand it. I'm not a baby. I can't
stand it--I shall die, I shall kill myself. HE told Grandmamma
that I was naughty, and now she is ill--she will die through me.
It is all his fault. Please let me--W-why should-he-tor-ment me?"

The tears choked my further speech. I sat down on the sofa,
and, with my head buried on Papa's knees, sobbed until I thought
I should die of grief.

"Come, come! Why are you such a water-pump?" said Papa
compassionately, as he stooped over me.

"He is such a bully! He is murdering me! I shall die! Nobody
loves me at all!" I gasped almost inaudibly, and went into
convulsions.

Papa lifted me up, and carried me to my bedroom, where I fell
asleep.

When I awoke it was late. Only a solitary candle burned in the
room, while beside the bed there were seated Mimi, Lubotshka, and
our doctor. In their faces I could discern anxiety for my health,
so, although I felt so well after my twelve-hours' sleep that I
could have got up directly, I thought it best to let them
continue thinking that I was unwell.



XVII. HATRED

Yes, it was the real feeling of hatred that was mine now--not the
hatred of which one reads in novels, and in the existence of
which I do not believe--the hatred which finds satisfaction in
doing harm to a fellow-creature, but the hatred which consists of
an unconquerable aversion to a person who may be wholly deserving
of your esteem, yet whose very hair, neck, walk, voice, limbs,
movements, and everything else are disgusting to you, while all
the while an incomprehensible force attracts you towards him, and
compels you to follow his slightest acts with anxious attention.

This was the feeling which I cherished for St. Jerome, who had
lived with us now for a year and a half.

Judging coolly of the man at this time of day, I find that he was
a true Frenchman, but a Frenchman in the better acceptation of
the term. He was fairly well educated, and fulfilled his duties
to us conscientiously, but he had the peculiar features of fickle
egotism, boastfulness, impertinence, and ignorant self-assurance
which are common to all his countrymen, as well as entirely
opposed to the Russian character,

All this set me against him, Grandmamma had signified to him her
dislike for corporal punishment, and therefore he dared not beat
us, but he frequently THREATENED us, particularly myself, with
the cane, and would utter the word fouetter as though it were
fouatter in an expressive and detestable way which always gave me
the idea that to whip me would afford him the greatest possible
satisfaction.

I was not in the least afraid of the bodily pain, for I had never
experienced it. It was the mere idea that he could beat me that
threw me into such paroxysms of wrath and despair.

True, Karl Ivanitch sometimes (in moments of exasperation) had
recourse to a ruler or to his braces, but that I can look back
upon without anger. Even if he had struck me at the time of which
I am now speaking (namely, when I was fourteen years old), I
should have submitted quietly to the correction, for I loved him,
and had known him all my life, and looked upon him as a member of
our family, but St. Jerome was a conceited, opinionated fellow
for whom I felt merely the unwilling respect which I entertained
for all persons older than myself. Karl Ivanitch was a comical
old "Uncle" whom I loved with my whole heart, but who, according
to my childish conception of social distinctions, ranked below
us, whereas St. Jerome was a well-educated, handsome young dandy
who was for showing himself the equal of any one.

Karl Ivanitch had always scolded and punished us coolly, as
though he thought it a necessary, but extremely disagreeable,
duty. St. Jerome, on the contrary, always liked to emphasise his
part as JUDGE when correcting us, and clearly did it as much for
his own satisfaction as for our good. He loved authority.
Nevertheless, I always found his grandiloquent French phrases
(which he pronounced with a strong emphasis on all the final
syllables) inexpressibly disgusting, whereas Karl, when angry,
had never said anything beyond, "What a foolish puppet-comedy it
is!" or "You boys are as irritating as Spanish fly!" (which he
always called "Spaniard" fly). St. Jerome, however, had names for
us like "mauvais sujet," "villain," "garnement," and so forth--
epithets which greatly offended my self-respect. When Karl
Ivanitch ordered us to kneel in the corner with our faces to the
wall, the punishment consisted merely in the bodily discomfort of
the position, whereas St. Jerome, in such cases, always assumed a
haughty air, made a grandiose gesture with his hand, and
exclaiming in a pseudo-tragic tone, "A genoux, mauvais sujet!"
ordered us to kneel with our faces towards him, and to crave his
pardon. His punishment consisted in humiliation.

However, on the present occasion the punishment never came, nor
was the matter ever referred to again. Yet, I could not forget
all that I had gone through--the shame, the fear, and the hatred
of those two days. From that time forth, St. Jerome appeared to
give me up in despair, and took no further trouble with me, yet I
could not bring myself to treat him with indifference. Every time
that our eyes met I felt that my look expressed only too plainly
my dislike, and, though I tried hard to assume a careless air, he
seemed to divine my hypocrisy, until I was forced to blush and
turn away.

In short, it was a terrible trial to me to have anything to do
with him.



XVIII. THE MAIDSERVANTS' ROOM

I BEGAN to feel more and more lonely, until my chief solace lay
in solitary reflection and observation. Of the favourite subject
of my reflections I shall speak in the next chapter. The scene
where I indulged in them was, for preference, the maidservants'
room, where a plot suitable for a novel was in progress--a plot
which touched and engrossed me to the highest degree. The heroine
of the romance was, of course, Masha. She was in love with Basil,
who had known her before she had become a servant in our house,
and who had promised to marry her some day. Unfortunately, fate,
which had separated them five years ago, and afterwards reunited
them in Grandmamma's abode, next proceeded to interpose an
obstacle between them in the shape of Masha's uncle, our man
Nicola, who would not hear of his niece marrying that "uneducated
and unbearable fellow," as he called Basil. One effect of the
obstacle had been to make the otherwise slightly cool and
indifferent Basil fall as passionately in love with Masha as it
is possible for a man to be who is only a servant and a tailor,
wears a red shirt, and has his hair pomaded. Although his methods
of expressing his affection were odd (for instance, whenever he
met Masha he always endeavoured to inflict upon her some bodily
pain, either by pinching her, giving her a slap with his open
hand, or squeezing her so hard that she could scarcely breathe),
that affection was sincere enough, and he proved it by the fact
that, from the moment when Nicola refused him his niece's hand,
his grief led him to drinking, and to frequenting taverns, until
he proved so unruly that more than once he had to be sent to
undergo a humiliating chastisement at the police-station.

Nevertheless, these faults of his and their consequences only
served to elevate him in Masha's eyes, and to increase her love
for him. Whenever he was in the hands of the police, she would
sit crying the whole day, and complain to Gasha of her hard fate
(Gasha played an active part in the affairs of these unfortunate
lovers). Then, regardless of her uncle's anger and blows, she
would stealthily make her way to the police-station, there to
visit and console her swain.

Excuse me, reader, for introducing you to such company.
Nevertheless, if the cords of love and compassion have not wholly
snapped in your soul, you will find, even in that maidservants'
room, something which may cause them to vibrate again.

So, whether you please to follow me or not, I will return to the
alcove on the staircase whence I was able to observe all that
passed in that room. From my post I could see the stove-couch,
with, upon it, an iron, an old cap-stand with its peg bent
crooked, a wash-tub, and a basin. There, too, was the window,
with, in fine disorder before it, a piece of black wax, some
fragments of silk, a half-eaten cucumber, a box of sweets, and so
on. There, too, was the large table at which SHE used to sit in
the pink cotton dress which I admired so much and the blue
handkerchief which always caught my attention so. She would be
sewing-though interrupting her work at intervals to scratch her
head a little, to bite the end of her thread, or to snuff the
candle--and I would think to myself: "Why was she not born a
lady--she with her blue eyes, beautiful fair hair, and
magnificent bust? How splendid she would look if she were sitting
in a drawing-room and dressed in a cap with pink ribbons and a
silk gown--not one like Mimi's, but one like the gown which I saw
the other day on the Tverski Boulevard!" Yes, she would work at
the embroidery-frame, and I would sit and look at her in the
mirror, and be ready to do whatsoever she wanted--to help her on
with her mantle or to hand her food. As for Basil's drunken face
and horrid figure in the scanty coat with the red shirt showing
beneath it, well, in his every gesture, in his every movement of
his back, I seemed always to see signs of the humiliating
chastisements which he had undergone.

"Ah, Basil! AGAIN?" cried Masha on one occasion as she stuck her
needle into the pincushion, but without looking up at the person
who was entering.

"What is the good of a man like HIM?" was Basil's first remark.

"Yes. If only he would say something DECISIVE! But I am powerless
in the matter--I am all at odds and ends, and through his fault,
too."

"Will you have some tea?" put in Madesha (another servant).

"No, thank you.--But why does he hate me so, that old thief of an
uncle of yours? Why? Is it because of the clothes I wear, or of
my height, or of my walk, or what? Well, damn and confound him!"
finished Basil, snapping his fingers.

"We must be patient," said Masha, threading her needle.

"You are so--"

"It is my nerves that won't stand it, that's all."

At this moment the door of Grandmamma's room banged, and Gasha's
angry voice could be heard as she came up the stairs.

"There!" she muttered with a gesture of her hands. "Try to please
people when even they themselves do not know what they want, and
it is a cursed life--sheer hard labour, and nothing else! If only
a certain thing would happen!--though God forgive me for thinking
it!"

"Good evening, Agatha Michaelovna," said Basil, rising to greet
her.

"You here?" she answered brusquely as she stared at him, "That is
not very much to your credit. What do you come here for? Is the
maids' room a proper place for men?"

"I wanted to see how you were," said Basil soothingly.

"I shall soon be breathing my last--THAT'S how I am!" cried
Gasha, still greatly incensed.

Basil laughed.

"Oh, there's nothing to laugh at when I say that I shall soon be
dead. But that's how it will be, all the same. Just look at the
drunkard! Marry her, would he? The fool! Come, get out of here!"
and, with a stamp of her foot on the floor, Gasha retreated to
her own room, and banged the door behind her until the window
rattled again. For a while she could be heard scolding at
everything, flinging dresses and other things about, and pulling
the ears of her favourite cat. Then the door opened again, and
puss, mewing pitifully, was flung forth by the tail.

"I had better come another time for tea," said Basil in a
whisper--"at some better time for our meeting."

"No, no!" put in Madesha. "I'll go and fetch the urn at once."

"I mean to put an end to things soon," went on Basil, seating
himself beside Masha as soon as ever Madesha had left the room.
"I had much better go straight to the Countess, and say 'so-and-
so' or I will throw up my situation and go off into the world. Oh
dear, oh dear!"

"And am I to remain here?"

"Ah, there's the difficulty--that's what I feel so badly about,
You have been my sweetheart so long, you see. Ah, dear me!"

"Why don't you bring me your shirts to wash, Basil?" asked Masha
after a pause, during which she had been inspecting his wrist-
bands.

At this moment Grandmamma's bell rang, and Gasha issued from her
room again,

"What do you want with her, you impudent fellow?" she cried as
she pushed Basil (who had risen at her entrance) before her
towards the door. "First you lead a girl on, and then you want to
lead her further still. I suppose it amuses you to see her tears.
There's the door, now. Off you go! We want your room, not your
company. And what good can you see in him?" she went on, turning
to Masha. "Has not your uncle been walking into you to-day
already? No; she must stick to her promise, forsooth! 'I will
have no one but Basil,' Fool that you are!"

"Yes, I WILL have no one but him! I'll never love any one else! I
could kill myself for him!" poor Masha burst out, the tears
suddenly gushing forth.

For a while I stood watching her as she wiped away those tears.
Then I fell to contemplating Basil attentively, in the hope of
finding out what there was in him that she found so attractive;
yet, though I sympathised with her sincerely in her grief, I
could not for the life of me understand how such a charming
creature as I considered her to be could love a man like him.

"When I become a man," I thought to myself as I returned to my
room, "Petrovskoe shall be mine, and Basil and Masha my servants.
Some day, when I am sitting in my study and smoking a pipe, Masha
will chance to pass the door on her way to the kitchen with an
iron, and I shall say, 'Masha, come here,' and she will enter,
and there will be no one else in the room. Then suddenly Basil
too will enter, and, on seeing her, will cry, 'My sweetheart is
lost to me!' and Masha will begin to weep, Then I shall say,
'Basil, I know that you love her, and that she loves you. Here
are a thousand roubles for you. Marry her, and may God grant you
both happiness!' Then I shall leave them together."

Among the countless thoughts and fancies which pass, without
logic or sequence, through the mind and the imagination, there
are always some which leave behind them a mark so profound that,
without remembering their exact subject, we can at least recall
that something good has passed through our brain, and try to
retain and reproduce its effect. Such was the mark left upon my
consciousness by the idea of sacrificing my feelings to Masha's
happiness, seeing that she believed that she could attain it only
through a union with Basil.



XIX. BOYHOOD

PERHAPS people will scarcely believe me when I tell them what
were the dearest, most constant, objects of my reflections during
my boyhood, so little did those objects consort with my age and
position. Yet, in my opinion, contrast between a man's actual
position and his moral activity constitutes the most reliable
sign of his genuineness.

During the period when I was leading a solitary and self-centred
moral life, I was much taken up with abstract thoughts on man's
destiny, on a future life, and on the immortality of the soul,
and, with all the ardour of inexperience, strove to make my
youthful intellect solve those questions--the questions which
constitute the highest level of thought to which the human
intellect can tend, but a final decision of which the human
intellect can never succeed in attaining.

I believe the intellect to take the same course of development in
the individual as in the mass, as also that the thoughts which
serve as a basis for philosophical theories are an inseparable
part of that intellect, and that every man must be more or less
conscious of those thoughts before he can know anything of the
existence of philosophical theories. To my own mind those
thoughts presented themselves with such clarity and force that I
tried to apply them to life, in the fond belief that I was the
first to have discovered such splendid and invaluable truths.

Sometimes I would suppose that happiness depends, not upon
external causes themselves, but only upon our relation to them,
and that, provided a man can accustom himself to bearing
suffering, he need never be unhappy. To prove the latter
hypothesis, I would (despite the horrible pain) hold out a
Tatistchev's dictionary at arm's length for five minutes at a
time, or else go into the store-room and scourge my back with
cords until the tears involuntarily came to my eyes!

Another time, suddenly bethinking me that death might find me at
any hour or any minute, I came to the conclusion that man could
only be happy by using the present to the full and taking no
thought for the future. Indeed, I wondered how people had never
found that out before. Acting under the influence of the new
idea, I laid my lesson-books aside for two or three days, and,
reposing on my bed, gave myself up to novel-reading and the
eating of gingerbread-and-honey which I had bought with my last
remaining coins.

Again, standing one day before the blackboard and smearing
figures on it with honey, I was struck with the thought, "Why is
symmetry so agreeable to the eye? What is symmetry? Of course it
is an innate sense," I continued; "yet what is its basis? Perhaps
everything in life is symmetry? But no. On the contrary, this is
life"--and I drew an oblong figure on the board--"and after life
the soul passes to eternity"--here I drew a line from one end of
the oblong figure to the edge of the board. "Why should there not
be a corresponding line on the other side? If there be an
eternity on one side, there must surely be a corresponding one on
the other? That means that we have existed in a previous life,
but have lost the recollection of it."

This conclusion--which seemed to me at the time both clear and
novel, but the arguments for which it would be difficult for me,
at this distance of time, to piece together--pleased me
extremely, so I took a piece of paper and tried to write it down.
But at the first attempt such a rush of other thoughts came
whirling though my brain that I was obliged to jump up and pace
the room. At the window, my attention was arrested by a driver
harnessing a horse to a water-cart, and at once my mind
concentrated itself upon the decision of the question, "Into what
animal or human being will the spirit of that horse pass at
death?" Just at that moment, Woloda passed through the room, and
smiled to see me absorbed in speculative thoughts. His smile at
once made me feel that all that I had been thinking about was
utter nonsense.

I have related all this as I recollect it in order to show the
reader the nature of my cogitations. No philosophical theory
attracted me so much as scepticism, which at one period brought
me to a state of mind verging upon insanity. I took the fancy
into my head that no one nor anything really existed in the world
except myself--that objects were not objects at all, but that
images of them became manifest only so soon as I turned my
attention upon them, and vanished again directly that I ceased to
think about them. In short, this idea of mine (that real objects
do not exist, but only one's conception of them) brought me to
Schelling's well-known theory. There were moments when the
influence of this idea led me to such vagaries as, for instance,
turning sharply round, in the hope that by the suddenness of the
movement I should come in contact with the void which I believed
to be existing where I myself purported to be!

What a pitiful spring of moral activity is the human intellect!
My faulty reason could not define the impenetrable. Consequently
it shattered one fruitless conviction after another--convictions
which, happily for my after life, I never lacked the courage to
abandon as soon as they proved inadequate. From all this weary
mental struggle I derived only a certain pliancy of mind, a
weakening of the will, a habit of perpetual moral analysis, and a
diminution both of freshness of sentiment and of clearness of
thought. Usually abstract thinking develops man's capacity for
apprehending the bent of his mind at certain moments and laying
it to heart, but my inclination for abstract thought developed my
consciousness in such a way that often when I began to consider
even the simplest matter, I would lose myself in a labyrinthine
analysis of my own thoughts concerning the matter in question.
That is to say, I no longer thought of the matter itself, but
only of what I was thinking about it. If I had then asked myself,
"Of what am I thinking?" the true answer would have been, "I am
thinking of what I am thinking;" and if I had further asked
myself, "What, then, are the thoughts of which I am thinking?"
I should have had to reply, "They are attempts to think of what
I am thinking concerning my own thoughts"--and so on.
Reason, with me, had to yield to excess of reason. Every
philosophical discovery which I made so flattered my conceit
that I often imagined myself to be a great man discovering new
truths for the benefit of humanity. Consequently, I looked down
with proud dignity upon my fellow-mortals. Yet, strange to
state, no sooner did I come in contact with those fellow-mortals
than I became filled with a stupid shyness of them, and, the
higher I happened to be standing in my own opinion, the less
did I feel capable of making others perceive my consciousness
of my own dignity, since I could not rid myself of a sense of
diffidence concerning even the simplest of my words and acts.



XX. WOLODA

THE further I advance in the recital of this period of my life,
the more difficult and onerous does the task become. Too rarely
do I find among the reminiscences of that time any moments full
of the ardent feeling of sincerity which so often and so
cheeringly illumined my childhood. Gladly would I pass in haste
over my lonely boyhood, the sooner to arrive at the happy time
when once again a tender, sincere, and noble friendship marked
with a gleam of light at once the termination of that period and
the beginning of a phase of my youth which was full of the charm
of poetry. Therefore, I will not pursue my recollections from
hour to hour, but only throw a cursory glance at the most
prominent of them, from the time to which I have now carried my
tale to the moment of my first contact with the exceptional
personality that was fated to exercise such a decisive influence
upon my character and ideas.

Woloda was about to enter the University. Tutors came to give him
lessons independently of myself, and I listened with envy and
involuntary respect as he drew boldly on the blackboard with
white chalk and talked about "functions," "sines," and so forth--
all of which seemed to me terms pertaining to unattainable
wisdom. At length, one Sunday before luncheon all the tutors--and
among them two professors--assembled in Grandmamma's room, and in
the presence of Papa and some friends put Woloda through a
rehearsal of his University examination--in which, to
Grandmamma's delight, he gave evidence of no ordinary amount of
knowledge.

Questions on different subjects were also put to me, but on all
of them I showed complete ignorance, while the fact that the
professors manifestly endeavoured to conceal that ignorance from
Grandmamma only confused me the more. Yet, after all, I was only
fifteen, and so had a year before me in which to prepare for the
examinations. Woloda now came downstairs for luncheon only, and
spent whole days and evenings over his studies in his own room--
to which he kept, not from necessity, but because he preferred
its seclusion. He was very ambitious, and meant to pass the
examinations, not by halves, but with flying colours.

The first day arrived. Woloda was wearing a new blue frockcoat
with brass buttons, a gold watch, and shiny boots. At the door
stood Papa's phaeton, which Nicola duly opened; and presently,
when Woloda and St. Jerome set out for the University, the girls
--particularly Katenka--could be seen gazing with beaming faces
from the window at Woloda's pleasing figure as it sat in the
carriage. Papa said several times, "God go with him!" and
Grandmamma, who also had dragged herself to the window, continued
to make the sign of the cross as long as the phaeton was visible,
as well as to murmur something to herself.

When Woloda returned, every one eagerly crowded round him. "How
many marks? Were they good ones?" "Yes." But his happy face was
an answer in itself. He had received five marks-the maximum! The
next day, he sped on his way with the same good wishes and the
same anxiety for his success, and was welcomed home with the same
eagerness and joy.

This lasted for nine days. On the tenth day there was to be the
last and most difficult examination of all--the one in divinity.

We all stood at the window, and watched for him with greater
impatience than ever. Two o'clock, and yet no Woloda.

"Here they come, Papa! Here they come!" suddenly screamed
Lubotshka as she peered through the window.

Sure enough the phaeton was driving up with St. Jerome and
Woloda--the latter no longer in his grey cap and blue frockcoat,
but in the uniform of a student of the University, with its
embroidered blue collar, three-cornered hat, and gilded sword.

"Ah! If only SHE had been alive now! " exclaimed Grandmamma on
seeing Woloda in this dress, and swooned away.

Woloda enters the anteroom with a beaming face, and embraces
myself, Lubotshka, Mimi, and Katenka--the latter blushing to her
ears. He hardly knows himself for joy. And how smart he looks in
that uniform! How well the blue collar suits his budding, dark
moustache! What a tall, elegant figure is his, and what a
distinguished walk!

On that memorable day we all lunched together in Grandmamma's
room. Every face expressed delight, and with the dessert which
followed the meal the servants, with grave but gratified faces,
brought in bottles of champagne.

Grandmamma, for the first time since Mamma's death, drank a full
glass of the wine to Woloda's health, and wept for joy as she
looked at him.

Henceforth Woloda drove his own turn-out, invited his own
friends, smoked, and went to balls. On one occasion, I even saw
him sharing a couple of bottles of champagne with some guests in
his room, and the whole company drinking a toast, with each
glass, to some mysterious being, and then quarrelling as to who
should have the bottom of the bottle!

Nevertheless he always lunched at home, and after the meal would
stretch himself on a sofa and talk confidentially to Katenka: yet
from what I overheard (while pretending, of course, to pay no
attention) I gathered that they were only talking of the heroes
and heroines of novels which they had read, or else of jealousy
and love, and so on. Never could I understand what they found so
attractive in these conversations, nor why they smiled so happily
and discussed things with such animation.

Altogether I could see that, in addition to the friendship
natural to persons who had been companions from childhood, there
existed between Woloda and Katenka a relation which
differentiated them from us, and united them mysteriously to one
another.



XXI. KATENKA AND LUBOTSHKA

Katenka was now sixteen years old--quite a grown-up girl; and
although at that age the angular figures, the bashfulness, and
the gaucherie peculiar to girls passing from childhood to youth
usually replace the comely freshness and graceful, half-developed
bloom of childhood, she had in no way altered. Still the blue
eyes with their merry glance were hers, the well-shaped nose with
firm nostrils and almost forming a line with the forehead, the
little mouth with its charming smile, the dimples in the rosy
cheeks, and the small white hands. To her, the epithet of it
girl," pure and simple, was pre-eminently applicable, for in her
the only new features were a new and "young-lady-like"
arrangement of her thick flaxen hair and a youthful bosom--the
latter an addition which at once caused her great joy and made
her very bashful.

Although Lubotshka and she had grown up together and received the
same education, they were totally unlike one another. Lubotshka
was not tall, and the rickets from which she had suffered had
shaped her feet in goose fashion and made her figure very bad.
The only pretty feature in her face was her eyes, which were
indeed wonderful, being large and black, and instinct with such
an extremely pleasing expression of mingled gravity and naivete
that she was bound to attract attention. In everything she was
simple and natural, so that, whereas Katenka always looked as
though she were trying to be like some one else, Lubotshka looked
people straight in the face, and sometimes fixed them so long
with her splendid black eyes that she got blamed for doing what
was thought to be improper. Katenka, on the contrary, always cast
her eyelids down, blinked, and pretended that she was short-
sighted, though I knew very well that her sight was excellent.
Lubotshka hated being shown off before strangers, and when a
visitor offered to kiss her she invariably grew cross, and said
that she hated "affection"; whereas, when strangers were present,
Katenka was always particularly endearing to Mimi, and loved to
walk about the room arm in arm with another girl. Likewise,
though Lubotshka was a terrible giggler, and sometimes ran about
the room in convulsions of gesticulating laughter, Katenka always
covered her mouth with her hands or her pocket-handkerchief when
she wanted to laugh. Lubotshka, again, loved to have grown-up men
to talk to, and said that some day she meant to marry a hussar,
but Katenka always pretended that all men were horrid, and that
she never meant to marry any one of them, while as soon as a male
visitor addressed her she changed completely, as though she were
nervous of something. Likewise, Lubotshka was continually at
loggerheads with Mimi because the latter wanted her to have her
stays so tight that she could not breathe or eat or drink in
comfort, while Katenka, on the contrary, would often insert her
finger into her waistband to show how loose it was, and always
ate very little. Lubotshka liked to draw heads; Katenka only
flowers and butterflies. The former could play Field's concertos
and Beethoven's sonatas excellently, whereas the latter indulged
in variations and waltzes, retarded the time, and used the pedals
continuously--not to mention the fact that, before she began, she
invariably struck three chords in arpeggio.

Nevertheless, in those days I thought Katenka much the grander
person of the two, and liked her the best.



XXII. PAPA

Papa had been in a particularly good humour ever since Woloda had
passed into the University, and came much oftener to dine with
Grandmamma. However, I knew from Nicola that he had won a great
deal lately. Occasionally, he would come and sit with us in the
evening before going to the club. He used to sit down to the
piano and bid us group ourselves around him, after which he would
beat time with his thin boots (he detested heels, and never wore
them), and make us sing gipsy songs. At such times you should
have seen the quaint enthusiasm of his beloved Lubotshka, who
adored him!

Sometimes, again, he would come to the schoolroom and listen with
a grave face as I said my lessons; yet by the few words which he
would let drop when correcting me, I could see that he knew even
less about the subject than I did. Not infrequently, too, he
would wink at us and make secret signs when Grandmamma was
beginning to scold us and find fault with us all round. "So much
for us children!" he would say. On the whole, however, the
impossible pinnacle upon which my childish imagination had placed
him had undergone a certain abasement. I still kissed his large
white hand with a certain feeling of love and respect, but I also
allowed myself to think about him and to criticise his behaviour
until involuntarily thoughts occurred to me which alarmed me by
their presence. Never shall I forget one incident in particular
which awakened thoughts of this kind, and caused me intense
astonishment. Late one evening, he entered the drawing-room in
his black dress-coat and white waistcoat, to take Woloda (who was
still dressing in his bedroom) to a ball. Grandmamma was also in
her bedroom, but had given orders that, before setting out,
Woloda was to come and say goodbye to her (it was her invariable
custom to inspect him before he went to a ball, and to bless him
and direct him as to his behaviour). The room where we were was
lighted by a solitary lamp. Mimi and Katenka were walking up and
down, and Lubotshka was playing Field's Second Concerto (Mamma's
favourite piece) at the piano. Never was there such a family
likeness as between Mamma and my sister--not so much in the face
or the stature as in the hands, the walk, the voice, the
favourite expressions, and, above all, the way of playing the
piano and the whole demeanour at the instrument. Lubotshka always
arranged her dress when sitting down just as Mamma had done, as
well as turned the leaves like her, tapped her fingers angrily
and said "Dear me!" whenever a difficult passage did not go
smoothly, and, in particular, played with the delicacy and
exquisite purity of touch which in those days caused the
execution of Field's music to be known characteristically as "jeu
perle" and to lie beyond comparison with the humbug of our modern
virtuosi.

Papa entered the room with short, soft steps, and approached
Lubotshka. On seeing him she stopped playing.

"No, go on, Luba, go on," he said as he forced her to sit down
again. She went on playing, while Papa, his head on his hand, sat
near her for a while. Then suddenly he gave his shoulders a
shrug, and, rising, began to pace the room. Every time that he
approached the piano he halted for a moment and looked fixedly at
Lubotshka. By his walk and his every movement, I could see that
he was greatly agitated. Once, when he stopped behind Lubotshka,
he kissed her black hair, and then, wheeling quickly round,
resumed his pacing. The piece finished, Lubotshka went up to him
and said, "Was it well played?" whereupon, without answering, he
took her head in his two hands, and kissed her forehead and eyes
with such tenderness as I had never before seen him display.

"Why, you are crying!" cried Lubotshka suddenly as she ceased to
toy with his watch-chain and stared at him with her great black
eyes. "Pardon me, darling Papa! I had quite forgotten that it was
dear Mamma's piece which I was playing."

"No, no, my love; play it often," he said in a voice trembling
with emotion. "Ah, if you only knew how much good it does me to
share your tears!"

He kissed her again, and then, mastering his feelings and
shrugging his shoulders, went to the door leading to the corridor
which ran past Woloda's room.

"Waldemar, shall you be ready soon?" he cried, halting in the
middle of the passage. Just then Masha came along.

"Why, you look prettier every day," he said to her. She blushed
and passed on.

"Waldemar, shall you be ready soon?" he cried again, with a cough
and a shake of his shoulders, just as Masha slipped away and he
first caught sight of me.

I loved Papa, but the intellect is independent of the heart, and
often gives birth to thoughts which offend and are harsh and
incomprehensible to the feelings. And it was thoughts of this
kind that, for all I strove to put them away, arose at that
moment in my mind.



XXIII. GRANDMAMMA

Grandmamma was growing weaker every day. Her bell, Gasha's
grumbling voice, and the slamming of doors in her room were
sounds of constant occurrence, and she no longer received us
sitting in the Voltairian arm-chair in her boudoir, but lying on
the bed in her bedroom, supported on lace-trimmed cushions. One
day when she greeted us, I noticed a yellowish-white swelling on
her hand, and smelt the same oppressive odour which I had smelt
five years ago in Mamma's room. The doctor came three times a
day, and there had been more than one consultation. Yet the
character of her haughty, ceremonious bearing towards all who
lived with her, and particularly towards Papa, never changed in
the least. She went on emphasising certain words, raising her
eyebrows, and saying "my dear," just as she had always done.

Then for a few days we did not see her at all, and one morning
St. Jerome proposed to me that Woloda and I should take Katenka
and Lubotshka for a drive during the hours generally allotted to
study. Although I observed that the street was lined with straw
under the windows of Grandmamma's room, and that some men in blue
stockings [Undertaker's men.] were standing at our gate, the
reason never dawned upon me why we were being sent out at that
unusual hour. Throughout the drive Lubotshka and I were in that
particularly merry mood when the least trifle, the least word or
movement, sets one off laughing.

A pedlar went trotting across the road with a tray, and we
laughed. Some ragged cabmen, brandishing their reins and driving
at full speed, overtook our sledge, and we laughed again. Next,
Philip's whip got caught in the side of the vehicle, and the way
in which he said, "Bother the thing!" as he drove to disentangle
it almost killed us with mirth. Mimi looked displeased, and said
that only silly people laughed for no reason at all, but
Lubotshka--her face purple with suppressed merriment--needed but
to give me a sly glance, and we again burst out into such Homeric
laughter, when our eyes met, that the tears rushed into them and
we could not stop our paroxysms, although they nearly choked us.
Hardly, again, had we desisted a little when I looked at
Lubotshka once more, and gave vent to one of the slang words
which we then affected among ourselves--words which always called
forth hilarity; and in a moment we were laughing again.

Just as we reached home, I was opening my mouth to make a
splendid grimace at Lubotshka when my eye fell upon a black
coffin-cover which was leaning against the gate--and my mouth
remained fixed in its gaping position.

"Your Grandmamma is dead," said St. Jerome as he met us. His face
was very pale.

Throughout the whole time that Grandmamma's body was in the house
I was oppressed with the fear of death, for the corpse served as
a forcible and disagreeable reminder that I too must die some
day--a feeling which people often mistake for grief. I had no
sincere regret for Grandmamma, nor, I think, had any one else,
since, although the house was full of sympathising callers,
nobody seemed to mourn for her from their hearts except one
mourner whose genuine grief made a great impression upon me,
seeing that the mourner in question was--Gasha! She shut herself
up in the garret, tore her hair and refused all consolation,
saying that, now that her mistress was dead, she only wished to
die herself.

I again assert that, in matters of feeling, it is the unexpected
effects that constitute the most reliable signs of sincerity.

Though Grandmamma was no longer with us, reminiscences and gossip
about her long went on in the house. Such gossip referred mostly
to her will, which she had made shortly before her death, and of
which, as yet, no one knew the contents except her bosom friend,
Prince Ivan Ivanovitch. I could hear the servants talking
excitedly together, and making innumerable conjectures as to the
amount left and the probable beneficiaries: nor can I deny that
the idea that we ourselves were probably the latter greatly
pleased me.

Six weeks later, Nicola--who acted as regular news-agent to the
house--informed me that Grandmamma had left the whole of her
fortune to Lubotshka, with, as her trustee until her majority,
not Papa, but Prince Ivan Ivanovitch!



XXIV. MYSELF

Only a few months remained before I was to matriculate for the
University, yet I was making such good progress that I felt no
apprehensions, and even took a pleasure in my studies. I kept in
good heart, and learnt my lessons fluently and intelligently. The
faculty I had selected was the mathematical one--probably, to
tell the truth, because the terms "tangent," "differentials,"
"integrals," and so forth, pleased my fancy.

Though stout and broad-shouldered, I was shorter than Woloda,
while my ugliness of face still remained and tormented me as much
as ever. By way of compensation, I tried to appear original. Yet
one thing comforted me, namely, that Papa had said that I had "an
INTELLIGENT face." I quite believed him.

St. Jerome was not only satisfied with me, but actually had taken
to praising me. Consequently, I had now ceased to hate him. In
fact, when, one day, he said that, with my "capacities" and my
"intellect," it would be shameful for me not to accomplish this,
that, or the other thing, I believe I almost liked him.

I had long ago given up keeping observation on the maidservants'
room, for I was now ashamed to hide behind doors. Likewise, I
confess that the knowledge of Masha's love for Basil had greatly
cooled my ardour for her, and that my passion underwent a final
cure by their marriage--a consummation to which I myself
contributed by, at Basil's request, asking Papa's consent to the
union.

When the newly-married couple brought trays of cakes and
sweetmeats to Papa as a thank-offering, and Masha, in a cap with
blue ribbons, kissed each of us on the shoulder in token of her
gratitude, I merely noticed the scent of the rose pomade on her
hair, but felt no other sensation.

In general, I was beginning to get the better of my youthful
defects, with the exception of the principal one--the one of
which I shall often again have to speak in relating my life's
history--namely, the tendency to abstract thought.



XXV. WOLODA'S FRIENDS

Although, when in the society of Woloda's friends, I had to play
a part that hurt my pride, I liked sitting in his room when he
had visitors, and silently watching all they did. The two who
came most frequently to see him were a military adjutant called
Dubkoff and a student named Prince Nechludoff. Dubkoff was a
little dark-haired, highly-strung man who, though short of
stature and no longer in his first youth, had a pleasing and
invariably cheerful air. His was one of those limited natures
which are agreeable through their very limitations; natures
which cannot regard matters from every point of view, but which
are nevertheless attracted by everything. Usually the reasoning
of such persons is false and one-sided, yet always genuine and
taking; wherefore their narrow egotism seems both amiable and
excusable. There were two other reasons why Dubkoff had charms
for Woloda and myself--namely, the fact that he was of military
appearance, and, secondly (and principally), the fact that he was
of a certain age--an age with which young people are apt to
associate that quality of "gentlemanliness" which is so highly
esteemed at their time of life. However, he was in very truth un
homme comme il faut. The only thing which I did not like about it
all was that, in his presence, Woloda always seemed ashamed of my
innocent behaviour, and still more so of my youthfulness. As for
Prince Nechludoff, he was in no way handsome, since neither his
small grey eyes, his low, projecting forehead, nor his
disproportionately long hands and feet could be called good
features. The only good points about him were his unusually tall
stature, his delicate colouring, and his splendid teeth.
Nevertheless, his face was of such an original, energetic
character (owing to his narrow, sparkling eyes and ever-changing
expression--now stern, now childlike, now smiling
indeterminately) that it was impossible to help noticing it. As a
rule he was very shy, and would blush to the ears at the smallest
trifle, but it was a shyness altogether different from mine,
seeing that, the more he blushed, the more determined-looking he
grew, as though he were vexed at his own weakness.

Although he was on very good terms with Woloda and Dubkoff, it
was clearly chance which had united them thus, since their tastes
were entirely dissimilar. Woloda and Dubkoff seemed to be afraid
of anything like serious consideration or emotion, whereas
Nechludoff was beyond all things an enthusiast, and would often,
despite their sarcastic remarks, plunge into dissertations on
philosophical matters or matters of feeling. Again, the two
former liked talking about the fair objects of their adoration
(these were always numerous, and always shared by the friends in
common), whereas Nechludoff invariably grew annoyed when taxed
with his love for a certain red-haired lady.

Again, Woloda and Dubkoff often permitted themselves to criticise
their relatives, and to find amusement in so doing, but
Nechludoff flew into a tremendous rage when on one occasion they
referred to some weak points in the character of an aunt of his
whom he adored. Finally, after supper Woloda and Dubkoff would
usually go off to some place whither Nechludoff would not
accompany them; wherefore they called him "a dainty girl."

The very first time that I ever saw Prince Nechludoff I was
struck with his exterior and conversation. Yet, though I could
discern a great similarity between his disposition and my own (or
perhaps it was because I COULD so discern it), the impression
which he produced upon me at first was anything but agreeable. I
liked neither his quick glance, his hard voice, his proud
bearing, nor (least of all) the utter indifference with which he
treated me. Often, when conversing, I burned to contradict him,
to punish his pride by confuting him, to show him that I was
clever in spite of his disdainful neglect of my presence. But I
was invariably prevented from doing so by my shyness.



XXVI. DISCUSSIONS

Woloda was lying reading a French novel on the sofa when I paid
my usual visit to his room after my evening lessons. He looked up
at me for a moment from his book, and then went on reading. This
perfectly simple and natural movement, however, offended me. I
conceived that the glance implied a question why I had come and a
wish to hide his thoughts from me (I may say that at that period
a tendency to attach a meaning to the most insignificant of acts
formed a prominent feature in my character). So I went to the
table and also took up a book to read. Yet, even before I had
actually begun reading, the idea struck me how ridiculous it was
that, although we had never seen one another all day, we should
have not a word to exchange.

"Are you going to stay in to-night, Woloda?"

"I don't know. Why?"

"Oh, because--" Seeing that the conversation did not promise to
be a success, I took up my book again, and began to read. Yet it
was a strange thing that, though we sometimes passed whole hours
together without speaking when we were alone, the mere presence
of a third--sometimes of a taciturn and wholly uninteresting
person--sufficed to plunge us into the most varied and engrossing
of discussions. The truth was that we knew one another too well,
and to know a person either too well or too little acts as a bar
to intimacy.

"Is Woloda at home?" came in Dubkoff's voice from the ante-room.

"Yes!" shouted Woloda, springing up and throwing aside his book.

Dubkoff and Nechludoff entered.

"Are you coming to the theatre, Woloda?"

"No, I have no time," he replied with a blush.

"Oh, never mind that. Come along."

"But I haven't got a ticket."

"Tickets, as many as you like, at the entrance."

"Very well, then; I'll be back in a minute," said Woloda
evasively as he left the room. I knew very well that he wanted to
go, but that he had declined because he had no money, and had now
gone to borrow five roubles of one of the servants--to be repaid
when he got his next allowance.

"How do you do, DIPLOMAT?" said Dubkoff to me as he shook me by
the hand. Woloda's friends had called me by that nickname since
the day when Grandmamma had said at luncheon that Woloda must go
into the army, but that she would like to see me in the
diplomatic service, dressed in a black frock-coat, and with my
hair arranged a la coq (the two essential requirements, in her
opinion, of a DIPLOMAT).

"Where has Woloda gone to?" asked Nechludoff.

"I don't know," I replied, blushing to think that nevertheless
they had probably guessed his errand.

"I suppose he has no money? Yes, I can see I am right, O
diplomatist," he added, taking my smile as an answer in the
affirmative. "Well, I have none, either. Have you any, Dubkoff?"

"I'll see," replied Dubkoff, feeling for his pocket, and
rummaging gingerly about with his squat little fingers among his
small change. " Yes, here are five copecks-twenty, but that's
all," he concluded with a comic gesture of his hand.

At this point Woloda re-entered.

"Are we going?"

"No."

"What an odd fellow you are!" said Nechludoff. "Why don't you say
that you have no money? Here, take my ticket."

"But what are you going to do?"

"He can go into his cousin's box," said Dubkoff.

"No, I'm not going at all," replied Nechludoff.

"Why?"

"Because I hate sitting in a box."

"And for what reason?"

"I don't know. Somehow I feel uncomfortable there."

"Always the same! I can't understand a fellow feeling
uncomfortable when he is sitting with people who are fond of him.
It is unnatural, mon cher."

"But what else is there to be done si je suis tant timide? You
never blushed in your life, but I do at the least trifle," and he
blushed at that moment.

"Do you know what that nervousness of yours proceeds from?" said
Dubkoff in a protecting sort of tone, "D'un exces d'amour propre,
mon cher."

"What do you mean by 'exces d'amour propre'?" asked Nechludoff,
highly offended. "On the contrary, I am shy just because I have
TOO LITTLE amour propre. I always feel as though I were being
tiresome and disagreeable, and therefore--"

"Well, get ready, Woloda," interrupted Dubkoff, tapping my
brother on the shoulder and handing him his cloak. "Ignaz, get
your master ready."

"Therefore," continued Nechludoff, it often happens with me
that--"

But Dubkoff was not listening. "Tra-la-la-la," and he hummed a
popular air.

"Oh, but I'm not going to let you off," went on Nechludoff. "I
mean to prove to you that my shyness is not the result of
conceit."

"You can prove it as we go along."

"But I have told you that I am NOT going."

"Well, then, stay here and prove it to the DIPLOMAT, and he can
tell us all about it when we return."

"Yes, that's what I WILL do," said Nechludoff with boyish
obstinacy, "so hurry up with your return."

"Well, do you think I am egotistic?" he continued, seating
himself beside me.

True, I had a definite opinion on the subject, but I felt so
taken aback by this unexpected question that at first I could
make no reply.

"Yes, I DO think so," I said at length in a faltering voice, and
colouring at the thought that at last the moment had come when I
could show him that I was clever. "I think that EVERYBODY is
egotistic, and that everything we do is done out of egotism."

"But what do you call egotism?" asked Nechludoff--smiling, as I
thought, a little contemptuously.

"Egotism is a conviction that we are better and cleverer than any
one else," I replied.

"But how can we ALL be filled with this conviction?" he inquired.

"Well, I don't know if I am right or not--certainly no one but
myself seems to hold the opinion--but I believe that I am wiser
than any one else in the world, and that all of you know it."

"At least I can say for myself," observed Nechludoff, "that I
have met a FEW people whom I believe to excel me in wisdom."

"It is impossible," I replied with conviction.

"Do you really think so?" he said, looking at me gravely.

"Yes, really," I answered, and an idea crossed my mind which I
proceeded to expound further. "Let me prove it to you. Why do we
love ourselves better than any one else? Because we think
ourselves BETTER than any one else--more worthy of our own love.
If we THOUGHT others better than ourselves, we should LOVE them
better than ourselves: but that is never the case. And even if it
were so, I should still be right," I added with an involuntary
smile of complacency.

For a few minutes Nechludoff was silent.

"I never thought you were so clever," he said with a smile so
goodhumoured and charming that I at once felt happy.

Praise exercises an all-potent influence, not only upon the
feelings, but also upon the intellect; so that under the
influence of that agreeable sensation I straightway felt much
cleverer than before, and thoughts began to rush with
extraordinary rapidity through my head. From egotism we passed
insensibly to the theme of love, which seemed inexhaustible.
Although our reasonings might have sounded nonsensical to a
listener (so vague and one-sided were they), for ourselves they
had a profound significance. Our minds were so perfectly in
harmony that not a chord was struck in the one without awakening
an echo in the other, and in this harmonious striking of
different chords we found the greatest delight. Indeed, we felt
as though time and language were insufficient to express the
thoughts which seethed within us.



XXVII. THE BEGINNING OF OUR FRIENDSHIP

From that time forth, a strange, but exceedingly pleasant,
relation subsisted between Dimitri Nechludoff and myself. Before
other people he paid me scanty attention, but as soon as ever we
were alone, we would sit down together in some comfortable corner
and, forgetful both of time and of everything around us, fall to
reasoning.

We talked of a future life, of art, service, marriage, and
education; nor did the idea ever occur to us that very possibly
all we said was shocking nonsense. The reason why it never
occurred to us was that the nonsense which we talked was good,
sensible nonsense, and that, so long as one is young, one can
appreciate good nonsense, and believe in it. In youth the powers
of the mind are directed wholly to the future, and that future
assumes such various, vivid, and alluring forms under the
influence of hope--hope based, not upon the experience of the
past, but upon an assumed possibility of happiness to come--that
such dreams of expected felicity constitute in themselves the
true happiness of that period of our life. How I loved those
moments in our metaphysical discussions (discussions which formed
the major portion of our intercourse) when thoughts came
thronging faster and faster, and, succeeding one another at
lightning speed, and growing more and more abstract, at length
attained such a pitch of elevation that one felt powerless to
express them, and said something quite different from what one
had intended at first to say! How I liked those moments, too,
when, carried higher and higher into the realms of thought, we
suddenly felt that we could grasp its substance no longer and go
no further!

At carnival time Nechludoff was so much taken up with one
festivity and another that, though he came to see us several
times a day, he never addressed a single word to me. This
offended me so much that once again I found myself thinking him a
haughty, disagreeable fellow, and only awaited an opportunity to
show him that I no longer valued his company or felt any
particular affection for him. Accordingly, the first time that he
spoke to me after the carnival, I said that I had lessons to do,
and went upstairs, but a quarter of an hour later some one opened
the schoolroom door, and Nechludoff entered.

"Am I disturbing you?" he asked.

"No," I replied, although I had at first intended to say that I
had a great deal to do.

"Then why did you run away just now? It is a long while since we
had a talk together, and I have grown so accustomed to these
discussions that I feel as though something were wanting."

My anger had quite gone now, and Dimitri stood before me the same
good and lovable being as before.

"You know, perhaps, why I ran away?" I said.

"Perhaps I do," he answered, taking a seat near me. "However,
though it is possible I know why, I cannot say it straight out,
whereas YOU can."

"Then I will do so. I ran away because I was angry with you--
well, not angry, but grieved. I always have an idea that you
despise me for being so young."

"Well, do you know why I always feel so attracted towards you? "
he replied, meeting my confession with a look of kind
understanding, "and why I like you better than any of my other
acquaintances or than any of the people among whom I mostly have
to live? It is because I found out at once that you have the rare
and astonishing gift of sincerity."

"Yes, I always confess the things of which I am most ashamed--but
only to people in whom I trust," I said.

"Ah, but to trust a man you must be his friend completely, and we
are not friends yet, Nicolas. Remember how, when we were speaking
of friendship, we agreed that, to be real friends, we ought to
trust one another implicitly."

"I trust you in so far as that I feel convinced that you would
never repeat a word of what I might tell you," I said.

"Yet perhaps the most interesting and important thoughts of all
are just those which we never tell one another, while the mean
thoughts (the thoughts which, if we only knew that we had to
confess them to one another, would probably never have the
hardihood to enter our minds)-- Well, do you know what I am
thinking of, Nicolas?" he broke off, rising and taking my hand
with a smile. "I propose (and I feel sure that it would benefit
us mutually) that we should pledge our word to one another to
tell each other EVERYTHING. We should then really know each
other, and never have anything on our consciences. And, to guard
against outsiders, let us also agree never to speak of one
another to a third person. Suppose we do that?"

"I agree," I replied. And we did it. What the result was shall be
told hereafter.

Kerr has said that every attachment has two sides: one loves, and
the other allows himself to be loved; one kisses, and the other
surrenders his cheek. That is perfectly true. In the case of our
own attachment it was I who kissed, and Dimitri who surrendered
his cheek--though he, in his turn, was ready to pay me a similar
salute. We loved equally because we knew and appreciated each
other thoroughly, but this did not prevent him from exercising
an influence over me, nor myself from rendering him adoration.

It will readily be understood that Nechludoff's influence caused
me to adopt his bent of mind, the essence of which lay in an
enthusiastic reverence for ideal virtue and a firm belief in
man's vocation to perpetual perfection. To raise mankind, to
abolish vice and misery, seemed at that time a task offering no
difficulties. To educate oneself to every virtue, and so to
achieve happiness, seemed a simple and easy matter.

Only God Himself knows whether those blessed dreams of youth were
ridiculous, or whose the fault was that they never became
realised.
